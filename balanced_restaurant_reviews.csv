Review,Sentiment
"Love!! We have the kung pao chicken, broccoli beef and of course the soup dumplings and they were all amazing",1
The new location that JH has moved into was a great idea. It is incredibly clean and fun atmosphere. The dumplings and Chinese far were spot on. I absolutely love their soup dumplings and they never disappoint. Cannot wait to return.,1
Delicious food. If you asked me to recommend a place to eat in Chinatown I would recommend this restaurant.,1
"I have been looking forward to Joe's Shanghai for quite some time, and finally got to go! This location is in Chinatown along with many other yummy Asian eateries. My friend and I split an order of pork soup dumplings, chicken lo mein, and shrimp fried rice, and it was plenty of food. The portions are pretty big which is good for eating in in large groups. All of our food was delicious and came out timely, even with a crowded restaurant. The soup dumplings were delicious and full of flavor, I would definitely recommend ordering these. The noodles were also very flavorful, they may have been my favorite item we got. The shrimp fried rice could have had a little more flavor, but nothing a little soy sauce couldn't fix! I would definitely recommend Joe's for a great meal in town!",1
I always come here just for the dumplings when in Chinatown! The restaurant is always busy but the dumplings come out quick. Delicious!!!!,1
"My friend T told me that I'd wake up thinking about soup dumplings the following day.  I thought this was impossible because the only food I wake up thinking about is Five Guys Burgers.

I hate when T is right, but he was right.  I almost don't mind that I burned the crap out of my mouth on the first try though my lower lip is bright red and I no longer have taste buds.  I still want to go back now.  Like, right now.  Soup dumplings are great (I only had the pork) though there is definitely an art to eating it correctly which I obviously have not mastered.

We also had the crispy beef which was good too, but was not soup dumplings.  

Place is pretty big, wait was 45 minutes on a Friday around 6:30 (we got foot massages across the street while we waited) and they seat patrons in wherever they can fit you.",1
"I looooooove the soup dumplings.  Get the crab meat one, because it is tastier.

The shanghai noodles are great as well.

I just do not come here often, because there are ALWAYS lines, and we always had to share tables with other patrons (except 1 time when I went in with 5 others)

Do not expect good service, because this restauarnt  is ALWAYS packed.",1
"Just like every other popular restaurant in Chinatown, you'll likely share a 10-person table with strangers, the wait will be long, and the service will be curt by American standards; that's all just part of the experience. 

The soup dumplings are among the best in town -- they're probably the richest, so don't come expecting a light, delicate broth -- and the wrappers are wonderfully paper-thin (in fact, that might even be a detriment, as they're hard to pick up without breaking lol).

The rest of the menu is only okay, but I always say that every restaurant has its specialties, and you have to know what to order, and sometimes more importantly, what NOT to order.",1
"This place has amazing xiaolong bao(soup dumplings) for the price along with delicious sautéed green beans that weren't overly salty, and a green onion pancake that is actually layered and flaky. I haven't found a good green onion pancake anywhere but LA so I'm happy to finally find one that isn't one dense piece. The service is efficient and they timed our dishes well while constantly refilling our drinks. Their fried calamari could use a little more seasoning in my opinion but other than that it was fried well. The spicy beef noodle soup had a delicious flavor, the broth wasn't overly salty and it had a nice kick of spice and flavor from the cilantro. I highly recommend this place but remember it's CASH ONLY",1
"If you are a fan of steamed soup dumplings, this is the place.

I can easily eat an order of Crab AND Pork dumplings by myself in a single sitting.  Maybe even a third order.

They are filled with super hot liquid so I like to hold the dumpling in the soup spoon and puncture the dumpling with a chopstick.  As the liquid oozes into the spoon.  Let it cool off a liitle and then slurp some of the soup.  Then take a bite of the dumpling.  

So juicy, so good.

You may want to wear an old shirt when you eat here as you end up squirting yourself at some point during your meal.

Cheers!
N.",1
Great dimsum place and in my opinion the best soup dumpling in the city. I always go to the Chinatown location as they have more options. Other dishes such as jellyfish and noodles are also great.,1
"I think the food here might be the best on planet earth and I'll leave it at that.
The soup dumplings r impeccable
The scallion pancakes r to die for.",1
"Food is super good. Shanghainese dumplings, eggplant, chives pancake...

Just don't expect nice service. Service is fast and efficient. You may have to share a table with strangers - no prob. You have to eat and then leave; if you linger, they will look over your shoulder and ask, ""need anything else?""",1
"I will literally travel halfway across the country for these Pork Soup Dumplings. I lived in Shanghai for a few months last year, and I can honestly say that the soup dumplings here are even better than many places in Shanghai. The other Chinese dishes here are pretty good as well. They're usually pretty packed, so don't expect stellar service. Honestly, it's pretty sufficient for a busy restaurant.",1
"Loveeee this place & their pork soup dumplings. 

They also have great scallion pancakes.  Service pretty good but it's the food that never disappoints.

Expect a long wait evenings/ weekends.",1
"Was recommended by a friend to try it out because it's a popular Chinese place and she was right. It was sooo busy when we went. Place is also not too big. Tables were pretty close to each other. We were lucky to get a table right away but then lines started to form after us. There was no empty table. Service was okay. They don't really come check on you but they are busy, so maybe that's why. The staff recommended the beef with string beans which we got and I really liked it. The beef was well marinated and not chewy at all. We also got a hot and sour soup, jelly fish, and soup dumplings for appetizer. Everything was pretty good. 
Note: this place is cash only. Not sure if it's a common thing in Chinatown NY but we didn't know.",1
"Incredible soup dumplings.  If the thought of delicate dumplings filled with pork and/or crab meat and hot broth gets your juices going, come by and stay awhile.

With the exception of the dumplings, which are among the best I've had in the States, the rest of the food is merely very good for standard Chinese.  The kung pao chicken is a fantastic mix and has just the right amount of kick to it.  The dried sauteed shredded beef is a new favorite in lowdel, oily, spicy, and perfectly filling.

Besides the food, the seating at the restaurant leaves much to be desired.  Small groups may have to share a larger table with another group.  Great if this is your first time and it feeds your diversity/authenticity craving, but just annoying otherwise.

Scalding your tongue here is like:
Watching Seinfeld for the first time, you laugh, it's good, haha, you're older now, it's not perfect, but you have your favorites, which you love even more: no soup dumpling nazi for you.",1
"Welp, Joe's went and moved so might as well review the place now since I can compare the old and new spots all at once. 

First of all, the new location (right on bowery) is bigger, nicer looking, but still somehow feels like the old place. Mostly because there is a line, and you still get a raffle ticket with a number on it that means nothing*. Here are some things that remain the same:

*Cash only
*Tax and tip are included in your bill (but leave a few anyway, as they only give themselves a 15% tip)
*That aforementioned line
*The quality of the food (we will get to this in a moment)

Some things that have changed:
*No liquor license yet, so don't expect a Tsingtao with your dumplings 
*Tea does not come automatically when you sit down, but if you ask they will still bring it...in a soda class now (bring back the teapot guys)
*The bathrooms are nicer
*The place is brighter than the old one

All in all, this place still feels like the Joe's of old, just an updated version of it. The dumplings are still cheap and still good, as is the fried rice. The portions of rice are also still exceedingly generous for the price point and should be shared (unless this is all you're getting, but come on, you're here for soup dumplings and you know it). I hope it gets worn in a little soon though, as Joe's to me should have the feeling of a place that has been around forever - this place is an NYC staple and should feel as such. Yes, the location on Pell St will be missed, but they needed to expand; the fact that there is still a line to get in, even with all the extra seating highlights this. Thanks for keeping the food and the prices the same, I'll absolutely be back for a bamboo tray of soup dumplings soon (no, I'm not sharing, get your own). 
___________
*If you're a party of two just stay in line, they will eventually need to fill a two top and if you're closest to the front of the line, you win.",1
"After having Din Tai Fung soup dumplings in Hong Kong, I thought there was no way I could find a better soup dumpling/XLB out there... Joe's Shanghai proved me wrong. This place is more affordable and by far more authentic, despite attracting the same amount of tourist popularity. 

Expect a wait, and expect to be crammed at a large table with other patrons if you only have 2-4 people in your group. The food comes pretty quickly, but don't expect attentive service here, which is typical of any busy Asian establishment. 

The scallion pancakes are really good. Crispy on the outside, chewy inside, and not too oily. Very flavorful, and the pancake itself is thick. You get a generous portion of soup dumplings for the price, and each dumpling has SO MUCH soup in it... much more than in the XLB from Din Tai Fung. We also ordered the pork with eggplant dish, which was delicious - make sure you get a bowl or two of white rice to go with this. 

All in all, an affordable and extremely satisfying meal. Definitely stop by if you are in the area and looking to fulfill a XLB craving.",1
Love the soup dumplings from this restaurant are amazing!  I tried a few other dishes but that is the one that stood out to me the most as it was my first time trying it.  Not entirely fond of sitting at a table with a bunch of strangers BUT that has nothing to do with the food.  Noodles where good and the scallion pancakes were delicious!,1
I tried this place on the way home from work- it didn't disappoint! The pork soup dumplings were fresh and flavorful and the scallion pancakes were delicious! I'll definitely be back!,1
"So I hope you people visiting NYC have gps on your cell phone because if we didn't, we would have never found this place. It was hidden in China town....where they take you to secret doors in the back that leads you to a room full of designer knock offs. It was kinda fun seeing all the different secret doors and stairs. LOL!!

Anyways...back to food. They have two different soup dumplings...they're both awesome with the vinegar soy sauce. Pick one or the other, or both....you'll love them. 

BTW, if you want to buy gifts to bring home, do all your I love ny shopping in china town. It'll save you a ton of money. You're welcome.",1
"It was a bit hard to find.  And after about a 10 minute wait on a busy beautiful Sunday in NYC during lunch, we were seated at a communal table, which we didn't mind.  

The waiters were not so friendly.  They knew we wanted the dumplings but before we could really look through the menu, he turns the pages for us and leads us right to the 2 choices of dumplings.  He also mumbled and we weren't sure if he got our order.  We wanted something light, because we wanted to walk down the street for dim sum afterwards.  So we got what others have been recommending... the crab/ pork dumplings and the scallion pancakes.  

They arrived a few minutes later and by that time an Englishman, obviously a tourist like us, sat at our table.  He watched us eat the dumplings carefully.  We placed each one on our spoon, bit a small hole, sucked the piping hot soup out, then poured some ginger, vinegar, soy sauce into it to cool it off before eating the rest of the dumpling.  The whole place smelled like the vinegar.  After the Englishman gets his dumplings, he thinks he can just take the whole thing with his chop sticks and pop it into his mouth.  Needless to say he burned his entire mouth and I bet the rest of the 15 dumplings he had to eat were not as enjoyable through a singed palate.  

The scallion pancakes were delicious.  Crunch, chewy, not too overpoweringly oniony.  

The dumplings were a hit as well.  The crab flavor was definitely from the crab roe (boogie, I call it).  I'm not normally a fan of the orange, yellowy goop when I eat fresh crab but the flavor in the dumpling was delicious.  

Despite the place having a ""pending grade"" from the sanitation department, being a bit grimy with not so friendly service... the experience of eating the soup dumpling was memorable.  As well as the price... $13.  Not bad at all.  I was very tempted to get more food off the menu.  It looked delicious as we could see from other tables.",1
"Their pork dumplings are perfect and also such a great deal! This is the only place I ever want to get pork dumplings ever again (5/5) 

We also got the shanghai fried rice (4/5) and the kung pao chicken (4/5, it was good but not the same as I remember two years ago. Last time I went it was the softest and tenderest chicken I'd ever had. this time the consistency was pretty average.) I also loved their scallion pancakes (5/5) so light and fluffy and crispy all at the same time.

Also, the new location is so much nicer than the old one! I cannot recommend this place and their soup dumpling enough!",1
"Came here every time I am in NYC. Always a line up on the dirty Chinatown streets, always cramped and busy inside. 
Juicy crab dumplings and their beef soup noodles are a must! 
Their slow roasted duck is extremely tender and juicy. Give it a try!",1
"You have to go and try the soup dumplings! Sooo good!!! We ate ate a communal table and met some wonderful New Yorkers who gave us some great tips on what to order and where else to go. Great cheap eats, one of our favorite meals!",1
"If I lived in Manhattan, this would be a regular place for me on a cold day.

Their Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai Soup Dumplings) are filled with a lot of soup and tasty meat. The skin was a bit thick for my tastes and the vinegar dipping sauce wasn't vinegar-y enough to balance the soup and thick skin. BUT I've never had that much soup in a Xiao Long Bao before! That seals the deal for me. Very filling.

Also had Scallion Pancake and some Pan Fried Pork Dumpling. Hard to go wrong with fried food :) Better than all the Xiao Long Bao's I've had in San Francisco.",1
"Everytime I'm in New York, I spend the first few days saying ""I want to go to Joe's Shanghai"" over and over again to anyone who even mentions food. Eventually I talk someone into going with me (usually lured by my promise of bringing them to Chinatown ""back rooms"" where you can get Luis Vuitton knockoffs for 25 bucks). I order the pork and crab soup dumplings and a Tsing Tao, and achieve true happiness which will last me until I'm in NY again. Akshay is right - don't bother ordering anything else. The soup dumplings will set you straight.",1
"I feel kind of bad. I've been here countless times and every time I just make a meal out of the Shanghainese dumpling (xiao long bao) or as my friends would call it ""soupy dumplings."" I should really try the rest of their menu. Come here for the xiao long bao and take caution eating it if it's your first time (the soup in the dumpling is hot). The scallion pancakes make a great appetizer and a cold bottle of tsing tao (a chinese beer) helps to cure any burns in your mouth from the ""soupy dumplings.""",1
I go alone so I can stuff as many motherloving soup dumplings my body cavity can hold without being judged by the people I love.,1
Thankfully I know the people running this joint cause the wait is unbearable... the soup buns and scallion pancakes never disappoint. Minus one star cause the sauce for the buns always spill out when getting to go. ; - (,1
"Lately I've been hearing so many great thing about Joe's Shanghai that I just had to try it. Finally on Friday night I made my way to Chinatown ( the hidden part) and after being asked to wait 15 minutes ( not bad at all , I thought it would be hours) I got to experience Joe's Shanghai. Dining here is definitely experience, definitely not a fancy place or anywhere near it, the service is take your order, feed you fast and get you the hell out of there. They seat you randomly with people you don't know but that makes the experience rather fun. Right away they offer you their signature crab or pork soup dumplings. I tried the pork soup dumplings, the waiter taught us how to eat them and damn were they good. We then ordered the sesame chicken which was delicious and full of flavor. The beef and broccoli wasn't my favorite, the broccoli was great but the beef a little chewy. We then had the pan fried noodles with chicken and vegetables and boy were they amazing! I will definitely be back to tried the crispy beef and other goodies. If you're in the mood to eat very casual, fast, fatty, good and cheap this is the place.",1
"CASH ONLY!!! FOOD IS TASTY!!! I love fried rice and general  chicken, but soup dumpling is a little heavy when it is cold!!",1
"What can you say about Joe's that hasn't been said. The vibe of the place, the smell, the formal and prompt service, and of course the soup dumplings. Magic. Deep fried whole duck anyone? Yes please.",1
"Really long wait. Shits good, but When the waiter dropped trow and starting pissing all over the table, I was like WHOA! I mean, I like R.Kelly as much as anyone else, but Geez Louise! Speaking of R.Kelly, has anyone heard the new album? Its surprisingly pretty good...I mean it doesn't hold up to the soul godfathers of yesteryear. I mean he's no Isaac Hayes or Curtis Mayfield, but it's definitely worth a listen.

 But I digress. Food is good, and the wait is really long, but anywhere I can get good dumplings and a golden shower at the same time merits 4 stars in my book! Cheers!",1
Get these dumplings! You will not regret it! Probably one of the best soup dumplings I've ever had. We got pork and they were so delicious!,1
"Read reviews for this place that made my mouth water! Drove all the way from Jersey to this place for the world famous soup dumplings. And oh my God it was delicious. The dumplings were filled with hot soup, the soup was rich and tasty, the skin of the dumplings was thin, the pork was tender, the soup dumplings were just down right succulent. I would def travel all the way back to NYC just for these dumplings, we almost mistaken some other restaurant down the street with a similar name, so make sure it's JOES SHANGHAI! And be careful! They are hot!",1
"Made the trip to Chinatown to pick-up from Joe's Shanghai (via Seamless/Grubhub) and it was well worth the effort. 

We had the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings and a Scallion Pancake for appetizers and both were excellent. We even managed to get the Soup Dumplings home intact (though we accidentally punctured a couple of them In serving them). Though they probably would have been even better if we had been able to eat them in the restaurant, they were still very much a treat.

For our main dish, we had the Peking Duck and it was also very well done. It came with the usual accompaniments (wraps, scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce) and was perfect for sharing. 

The service was friendly and efficient.  They have a table setup right inside the door and the food was well packaged for travel.

Great choice for pick-up or delivery!",1
"Decent beef noodle soup for $5, and 8 xiaolongbao for $5?  Pretty cool.  The green onion pancakes (congyoubing) was kind of fried in a funky way - nowhere near what I had regularly in Taipei.

The soup dumplings were pretty good.  They were huge and the skin is thick (which I like).  the filling was okkay..  I think I'm spoiled from Din Tai Fung.

But the price, and the quantity, and just the overall fast, Chinese service makes it pretty great in my book.  

3.5 bumped up to a 4.

Went on a Saturday around 5:15 and was seated in 5 minutes (with 2 other people).

Pretty crowded, but I was a little skeptical at first.  It's filled with bairen. Heh.",1
This place is awesome. Shared a table. Good sized portions. Definitely get dumplings. Super busy and a small wait but you'd expect that with such great food.,1
First experience having xiao long bao .  I took the Chinese bus solo.  Seated at a 6 top with several other people that didn't know each other...and we were all there on a mission.  Xiao Long Bao.... I'd so do it again! The BEST!,1
"Great food, but in Flushing NY not NYC.  Loud, busy, crowded, wonderful!",1
"My girlfriend and I just moved to Chinatown so we Yelped the area and saw this place with the most reviews. LIke everyone else has said, get the pork dumpling to start off with. They seat you at a big round table with a bunch of other strangers so be open to having some one you don't know sitting next to you. Give them some time to cool down or cut open and let the HOT juice out. They have tons of fish, chicken, pork, beef and other dishes to choose from so go hungry. They staff is very fast paced to hurry and make your decision on what you want. When you're finished don't sit and make small talk unless you notice that  there isn't a line out the door of people waiting. If you do stay and they have people waiting they usually get their one staple guys to politely walk by several times and say ' Ok, Thank youuuu......ok, thank youuuuu!'

That's their nice way of saying, thanks for coming now get the ?#&* out :-)",1
"Lived up to the hype. Price are reasonable, portions are large enough to be considered family style. I had the crab meat and pork soup dumplings and the chicken and shrimp with plum sauce. Both were very good. The soup dumplings are a must try and it's what they are famous for. You really cant go wrong with any dish. 

I took a photo after I ate a bunch of dumplings so note the dumplings currently come with 8 (not 4 as in the pic).",1
"I heard this place was famous... So of course as I was in NY I had to go! I am very happy that I did! To be honest, I am giving 4 stars only because the place itself is small and crowded. I was wearing a large, warm jacket and there was no room for it. I felt like I was hitting people as I was walking past them to get to my seat. 

The food itself was absolutely amazing though. It was my first time getting dumplings so I was a tad nervous, but overall I had a great experience.  I had the pork dumplings, put some soy sauce on them, and they were so GOOD. We also got the chicken lo mein, that was pretty good as well. 

Super cool location in Chinatown, I just wish the restaurant was bigger and spaced out differently.",1
"Out of all the Chinese restaurants out here in NYC, this would be the only one I would keep on going to! CHEAP AND TASTY 

There soup dumplings are AMAZING! nothing like its kind in Cali (yet). Be careful while trying to eat them because they make a great splash. Even after +10 times coming here, I still make a big mess. I love taking the first bite and slurping up the soup. Suggest using a spoon to aid in eating. Add vinegar and hot sauce will top it off! The pork dumplings are so bomb, but also try the seafood ones as well. Both so good and delicious!

The other dishes are ok, not to my standard of chinese food, but I suggest just order 2-3 orders of dumpling and that should be good enough for 2 people.",1
"Wow! Amazing soup dumplings. My friends and I got the pork and crab soup dumplings and we both agreed that pork was the best!! (Pork is the classic soup dumpling protein choice). The size of those dumplings are HUGE and filled with plenty of delicious warm soup. I would say they're the BEST soup dumplings I've had. (I've tried the ones in Asia too!)

We also got the fried rice and they were amazing. It was a bit greasy but that's what made it good. Would say it was a guilty pleasure! 

Definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone visiting or in New York. It's a must try! 


Tip 1: Bring CASH!! Most China town restaurants only accept cash. They do have an ATM right outside the restaurant 

Tip 2: Don't be intimidated by the line. You can get seated soon if it's a party of two.",1
"soup dumplings were great, and the sesame pancake was good too. we were there late on a Sunday night, and it was packed! 
service was ok, prices were good, and I will return!",1
"The real deal when it comes to soup dumplings. They don't take reservations I think but expect to wait a bit if busy. Love their fried rice, egg drop soup, soup dumplings, bok choy and lo mein. Casual fast service! Must try.",1
This place was amazing! It was a spur of the moment to go & I don't regret it one bit. The soup dumplings are the best ones I have ever had in my whole entire life & I am 101% sure I'm never going to find another place who makes them as good as them. They do only take cash & it was 45 minute wait with a line out the door BUT it was worth it. I would do it again if I had too.,1
Communal Chinese eating at it's best! Long waits are marginalized when tables of 8-10 strangers share their dining experience. The waiter takes your soup dumpling order before you are even seated. Wonderful food experience - delish eggplant & scallion pancakes at extremely reasonable prices. Super attentive waitstaff.,1
"I loved this new location that they moved to. The new restaurant is beautiful and clean and spacious unlike the old spot. And they're not competing with imitators next door. Came for the soup dumplings. I got greedy and ordered 2 orders so had to take one home and they still tarred so good the next day. My 2 year old daughter loved it. I took some American friends and they only got fried rice but they said it was the best they had.

Make sure you don't come hangry cuz you will have to wait and make sure you bring cash as they are cash only!",1
Soup dumplings are to die for. The scallion pancakes are deft the best... it's family style. You get to engage with other locals. It's a quick in and out though. Super fast service.,1
"The main reason you should step food into Joe's is for the soup dumplings.  they're very, very good.  soupey, porky, savory, and delicious.  Everything else is marginal.  but seriously- why are you looking at the rest of the menu?",1
"CASH ONLY. Love this place. The eggplant dish is so good. Also got some fried rice, divine. This place is usually really crowded so last time we went, we got our food to go which suited us fine. They have a love of food.",1
"I want to give Joe's a 5 star rating on account of their soup dumpings. I dream about these bad boys and have actually ventured all the way to chinatown from the upper east side just to get my fix. 

The rest of the food is decent quality chinese food. Not amazing but not bad, either (hence the downgrade to 4 stars). Go for dumplings and you'll never be disappointed.",1
"Oh. I like the samplings soooo much. 
Also the stuff called ""baozi"". 
I would introduce it to my friends.",1
"The best xiao long bao ever - it's a MUST! I would recommend getting the Shanghai Style Pan Fried Noodles as well. 

If you don't know how to eat xiao long bao (some people in our table didn't know how), just pick up your XLB with your chopsticks and place it in ur spoon then drizzle some soy sauce + ginger on it. Then poke a hole into the XLB with your chopsticks and drink the broth in the spoon and TAKE A BITE! :-) 

The only thing that was weird for me was how we were seated. You basically get seated at a round table with a bunch of random strangers depending on your party number. My boyfriend and I got seated at a table with 4 different parties. I think I'm just used to sitting with my family during dim-sum time, but you totally forget about this once you get your food!

TIP: I would recommend ordering one dish at a time. My boyfriend and I got pretty full after an order of XLB and the Shanghai Noodles.... we still ordered another XLB though...",1
"Walked by and noticed there wasn't a huge line, so I made it a deal to visit again.

Last time I came to Joes Shanghai, I wasnt too crazy about the place itself- since the service was ok and I was being seated with complete strangers which got pretty awkward. However, the pork soup dumpings made it all worth it.

This time around it wasnt as busy, so the service was better as expected. I was just with my boyfriend, so I had to sit with random people again. I guess since I knew what I was expecting, it wasnt awkward at all. The other couple at the table were actually visiting from California and didnt know what to order, and I found myself babbling about how great the place is to convince them to get the soup dumplings.

After not much convincing (literally like 5 seconds later) the other couple also ordered soup dumplings. And we all sat and raved how great they were as we were eating them hahah

Seriously the best soup dumplings ever though.",1
"I hate to give them a 5 star cause the wait and the service was horrible. But they were that good. 

We got to Joe's around 6pm on a Sunday and there was a crowd already. Hostess said 30 minutes so we waited. LIAR!!! took us an hour. But oh well. 

We were seated with another party of two on the same table. It was super awkward but after the food came out we didnt care. 

We had the

128. Singapore Chow Mai Fun - AHHHHH DONT GET THIS!! we tried to be adventurous and we failed. Miserably. 

The Crab soup dumplings and the scallion pancakes were bananas. Twice as big ad Din Tai Fung. The soup is also way more dense. It was too delicious. We were moaning after a couple bites. Sorry table next to us. We messed up with the order and they cancelled our pork dumplings but we were too stuffed . Next time Joe's! 

Also, we left around 8pm and they were calling numbers saying some people wont be able to be seated so get there early.",1
"CASH ONLY.

Absolutely love XLBs and heard this was THE spot to check them out (from Chicago so there surprisingly aren't many good places for XLB).

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and no surprise, there was a line. We had a party of 5 and didn't have to wait too long, maybe 20-30mins? Estimated was 45-60 so we were quite happy! 
Please note your entire party must be present to be seated.

*We were all seated in a big round table with other parties. Looks like they do communal seating to maximize tables. We didn't feel too squished luckily but perhaps not everyone's cup of tea.*

Ordered the two crab and pork XLB and two regular pork one (each order came with 8 baos). Both were absolutely amazing! Perfectly thin skin with a delicious broth inside. They also give you a dish of soy sauce/vinegar/ginger mix. The party next to use ordered fried rice only and we couldn't believe it, but to each their own! 

Would definitely come here again the next time in NYC - for more XLB and probably try some of their other dishes!",1
I highly recommend this place for its authentic food and good service. Don't let the tightness of the place be a bother. Just be a part of the celebration of the Shanghai's best.,1
"Just here to reiterate what everyone else has already reviewed:

After the rave reviews of a couple friends, and trying some soup dumpings in the SF bay area, I can say with conviction that these soup dumpings are worth the hype.

I was even more impressed by the Shanghai Noodles.  If you visit this place, you NEED to order the shanghai noodles.... this is NOT an option.

This is definitely going to be a stop of mine with every trip to NYC.",1
"What an interesting dinner experience! 

Pops and I were staying in Lower East during our trip to NY and we knew we had to visit Chinatown at least once, being so close to the area. We decided to grab dinner as well and found this great place!
Obviously one of the most famous places in the neighborhood, we knew we had to drop in to taste their famous xiaolongbaos.

The arrangement of the restaurant was quite a sight. All these different groups of people were seated in the huge round tables with other strangers. It was interesting to share a table with 8 other people that I had never met before. 

Service was very quick even though the place was packed. We got the xiaolongbaos and eggplant dish. As I had expected, the soup dumplings were absolutely delectable. The soup was so wonderful and there was no need to dip the dumpling in the soy sauce. The eggplant was very delicious too. Portions were huge and we had to ask for a side bowl of rice to eat with the eggplant since the sweet taste was very strong. 

Although it was a tad bit uncomfortable to share a round table with strangers... It was a fun experience and the delicious food soon made me forget about the awkward crowdedness. Seriously, those dumplings really were amazing!!",1
Joes shanghai is known for their soup dumpling and let me tell you it's very good. It comes out hot and taste amazing.,1
"Pretty good dumplings.   I also got vege crispy pan fried noodle, and scallion pancake.

Scallion pancake is s dish that's hard to go wring with and theirs did not dissappoint.

Pan fried noodles had a bit too much sauce, but i thought it was pretty good.


They didn't have a ton of stuff my picky girlfriend wanted to eat, but maybe that's because she was not in a good mood.   I think the scallion pancakes cheered her up a little bit though.


This place is probably better for parties of 4+. Dishes are huge, so be careful not to over order.",1
"OKAY BEST PORK SOUP DUMPLINGS EVER. Blown away. Could have eaten 20 of them myself. The other food was way good too, but definitely make sure to get the pork soup dumplings. That's a MUST!!! The line is usually long so plan on about a 45-60 min wait. Luckily there's fun little shops and you can walk around China town to kill time.",1
"We were in China town and we wanted to find a really good restaurant in that area so we decide to yelp it and this restaurant came up with a four star rating so we had to try it.  

The place was packed with tourist.  The waiters were not that helpful with the menu, but we found out by neighbors seated next to us that the place was known for its soup dumplings (which were excellent).  
Definitely worth it.",1
good pork steamed buns and snow pea leaves.,1
"This review will also be jumping on the soup dumpling hype train that Joe's Shanghai so rightfully deserves.

On top of the raving reviews already placed here, I'd like to add one more note about the soup dumplings: even if you are a baby in chopstick using years, the likelihood of you getting dumpling to face while retaining soup in said dumpling has gone up 100% because the top of the dumplings are rather firm and the skin is thick enough that if you pull gently but firmly, you will be rewarded with soup galore.

Trust me, if you're going on a first date and you're going with someone who knows their chopsticks but you're not prepared for that chopsticks interview but you still want to pass off as somewhat knowledgeable of good food in NYC, order those soup dumplings so that 1) the most awkward part of the date is not that you don't have a table to yourself to create intimacy but it's that you might make a fool of yourself with lack of chopsticks skills but it turns out 2) any type of wiggling chopsticks will still get those dumplings where they need to be: your stomach, 3) your date will be so distracted by how fabulous the soup dumplings taste that your date won't even notice you struggling to convert dumpling to mouth, and 4) you haven't gone to the ATM in weeks but these dumplings are $7-10 for 8 per order and you had $20 in your pocket anyway so phew! you got this. Second date in the bag. Now go get ramen.",1
"Joe's Shanghai has the best xiao long baos ever!

I have never said that about a xiao long bao, and I might not ever say that ever again for another restaurant. Thanks to a recommendation from a friend who came here a few months prior, I'm glad I made the stop here for dinner. Came in around 6pm, and my friend and I were seated immediately. Because we're a small party in a trendy restaurant, naturally the servers would seat us at a big table to share with other customers. The restaurant has that typical Chinese restaurant setup, which I'm glad because a lot of popular restaurants would have probably conformed to a more modern look.

My friend and I shared the crab and pork soup dumplings.

YES, THEY CAME. Everything came out hot and fresh, and was just YES. Not even a dollar per dumpling, AND the dumplings were filled to the max with flavorful soup? How could anyone resist?! Even adding a piece of ginger and some vinegar sauce on the side made it delicious. I was extremely satisfied with solely the taste. It's hard to find really good XLBs like these too.

WARNING: Soup is burning hot inside so be careful not to take a huge bite.

Made. My. Day.",1
The soups dumplings are okay. For NYC they're pretty good. Other dishes are many typical Americanized Chinese dishes.,1
"By far the best Xiao Long Baos (pork meat soup dumpling) I've ever had! I've had quite a few but these are definitely my favorite. The size, price, texture, quality, and taste were all great. Had to get a whole 2nd order of them after seeing how good they were.

Highly recommend!",1
"My first time at Joe's Shang hai. Had always heard good things and had to try it for myself!

Prices were very good and the food is so filling. We ordered soup dumplings and scallion pancake. They give a lot and it really fills you up. Great service and short wait. 

Pretty good and highly recommend!",1
"I love this place over din tai fung. 
There's a hustle and bustle to this restaurant. Just be prepared to feel claustrophobic 
Food is great!!!! Definitely recommend the soup dumplings. They need to franchise this place!!!!!",1
"Soup dumplings. Enough said.

But if you want a few more words, I like to order the scallion pancake. My boyfriend had the seafood noodles once and it was a huge bowl with a colorful arrangement of seafood pieces (shrimp, crabmeat, that squiggly pink thing you see in ramen) and veggies. We love our veggies!",1
"It's almost impossible to get a table at this place because the lines are so long, so I ordered takeout on Grubhub instead. I ordered the pork meat soup dumplings and the scallion pancakes. The downside of getting them to-go is that they're not steaming hot when you go to eat them. Still, the soup in the soup dumplings is probably the best soup I've ever had in a soup dumpling. I can see the hype behind this place. It's worth it!",1
"Best spot for dumplings and so much more! I always make sure to order from this place (in the pandemic) if I'm at all nearby. Pre-COVID, the long wait was worth it.",1
"As close to traditional Chinese food you will ever get  at a restaurant in Manhattan. 
Soup dumpling are fenominal but also the whole fish is delicious. 
If you love fish, I recommend getting any fish prepared whole on the menu.",1
"The reviews are true. It is good, I had the spicy beef specialty and a soup dumpling. It's pricey but they are shareable for two",1
"The first time i've ever had soup dumplings was at Joe's.  Since then i have found Shanghai Cafe who's soup dumplngs are better than Joe's and you dont have to share a table with other parties.  I do love Joe's but it has become a tourist spot and the quality and service isn't what it used to be.  Dont get me wrong, the food is great.  The sesame chicken and the fish in black bean sauce are awsome.
I just dont unerstand why the prices would be higher at their other locations.  The location in Queens has to be the worst when it comes to service.",1
"Holy mother of Soup Dumplings, this place is the S#!$! 

I heard about it through some colleagues, and fell in lurve once I popped a dumpling. The vinegar sauce with ginger balances the slightly oily soup, but I prefer to load on the spice for extra flavor! 

There is a reason people come from all over for this restaurant, and wait in line when it's 12 degrees out for over an hour. The price is also recession-friendly.

It took me a few times before I was able to branch out and order other items on the menu, as I tend to go specifically for the SD. Try the scallion pancakes, Crispy Jumbo Prawns, and Kung Pao Chicken (my favorites). 
I'm a firm believer they add a hint of crack in the soup, because I just can't stay away!",1
"The best soup dumplings ever. I will be a loyal customer for life. Also love the entrees. General Tso chicken, crispy shredded beef, spicy Szechuan beef, all good. Also love the scallion pancake and the cold sesame noodles. Go there, it's the best. Nice new location with more seating (inside and out ), but I do miss the charm of the Pell Street Joe's.",1
I love this place !!! Always going to different places to compare Chinese food taste. This place was very good but little noise. Dumplings soup was ok. Definitely will advise for my friends.,1
"so.good.

unfortunate that you can't make reservations and sometimes you literally wait till the end of time for a table because it gets so crowded.

but well worth it the hangry temper once you get your dumplings :)",1
"Here's the thing. People go to Joe's to try soup dumplings, because most places in the country don't have them. And they are delicious. They are also made with lava inside, so punch a hole in them or take a little bit to let them cool, lest you set your facehole on fire and lose the ability to taste anything else. And you should taste other things, too, because Joe's has so much more than soup dumplings. Fried rice cakes with shrimp is another thing. Cold sesame noodles. Fried pork dumplings. About 170 other dishes.
Here is my one issue with the place. It is really popular, and as such, they can pull off communal seating and a really weird scheme for seating you and your group. My group of 4 waited about 15 minutes when we were called. Then, we were put inside in on-deck-circle, waiting in a totally in the way area for another 10 minutes, waiting for space to open up. We spent that time getting closer and closer to one another as people came up to the register for one reason or another, even though the wait staff will take your money at the table. Whatever. This would not work in a place less amazing.
It's worth it.",1
"Another place I have to stop to get some delicious soup dumplings. They've relocated since I last visited in 2019. They don't take reservations and they're cash only. We went on a Sunday evening, around 5pm and I had to go inside to grab a ticket. It was about a 45 minute wait. Luckily, it had stopped raining so we just hung out outside until our number was called. 

I recall the previous location being family style seating but probably because of Covid, it's no longer like that. We were seated at our own table but we were fairly close to other tables so it's not like social distancing was a thing. I knew that I wanted the pork soup dumplings so I ordered that and my fiancé order the hot and sour soup and lo mein. 

Everything came out quick and hot. I took a bite of one of the soup dumplings and burnt my tongue but I was so excited to eat them! I topped the dumplings with the ginger sauce that they provided up. The soup was so rich and tasty. It was very comforting since in was cold and wet outside. I tried a spoonful of my fiancé's soup and it was good as well, hot! The lo mein was really good. I was very pleased that it was not too salty. I've had lo mein at other places and they've always been too salty. 

The service wasn't that great but I would still come back just for the food. I did notice that a 15% service charge was added at the bottom of my receipt which caught me off guard but I'm glad I noticed it.",1
Best soup dumplings and peking duck I have ever had. Food came out in a timely manner m. Will definitely be back!,1
"Review only for food. Their soup dumpling is perfect. I have no whatever complaint to it. Rich, tasty, juicy, memorable! The dumpling skin was thin yet held the juice in very well. Juice from the well marinated meat was delicious. However, other dishes are ok only. I had the wonton noodle soup and some stirred fried seafood dishes. They are average like other Chinese restaurants. It would have been 3 stars if I hadn't had the soup dumplings.
Be aware. They are cash only and the wait was pretty long during lunch time (12-2).",1
"I've been here a couple times.  The food here is good.  The xiao long bao's are very good.  The other dishes were good as well.  I really liked the scallion pancakes here, they came out extremely crispy, which I like.  The other dishes were good as well like the noodle soup they had and the sliced stir fried rice cakes.  

Overall, very good. This location gets really crowded at times, but its usually worth the wait.",1
Good food good service. Would return for their soup dumplings. Server was helpful letting us know how much soup dumplings to use for our group. Vet attentive. Gotta stop by here if you're in China Town. Definitely with a try.,1
"I've been coming here since I was a teenager... less often when I was actually living in Chinatown, way more often now that I know how special their soup dumplings really are having moved away. 

Yes, they are known for their soup dumplings.. and yes, that's all I ever get there because if you are already in Chinatown there are far better places to get anything else on the menu. 

Some people might say that Din Tai Fung is far superior to Joes.. but I wouldn't go that far.. DTF is good, really good, but different from Joes. You come to Joes for the big juicy, impossible to eat in one bite dumplings.. you go to DTF for the small flavorful bites. With that said, I have yet to find anywhere that does the soup quite like Joes does. 

I will, however, say that Joes has been slippin throughout the years. What once was easily a consistent 5 star meal now has its 3-4 star days where the dumplings are overcooked, stuck together to where it's impossible not to break them causing all the juicy goodness to go to waste, or sometimes worse.. all the juice has dried up due to the overcooking. This seems to happen more often during off peak times when it is not busy.. perhaps they have their B-level chef running things during those times.. but anytime I come during peak hours (weekends, holidays, lunch, etc) they are always on point. 

Even with all the slippage, I will keep returning to joes for my soup dumpling fix bc I've yet to find anywhere else that does it better than Joes on a good day, and it's good enough for me to consistently come back knowing that I might encounter an off day. 

Get the crab or the crab/pork mixed ones over the plain pork ones.",1
Delicious food with very fast service! My friend and I went on a Sunday evening and it was busy but they sat us within 15 minutes and we had our soup dumplings in front of us about 10 minutes after we sat down! This spot is great for ordering a few different things and sharing everything among your party! Must try: soup dumplings of course and Shanghai noodles! We also got the sesame chicken which was nice and crispy,1
"Went here during jury duty last week. Got sat at a group table and had a very good meals. All i ordered was the crab and pork dumplings and they were out of this world. They are the dumplings that have broth inside them. They just had an incredible flavor to them. Got there at 1pm, had my food by 1:15 and back to the jury room at 1:45. Great break from a day of sitting around waiting to be picked for service.",1
"It's in Chinatown hence it is Asian cuisine. Let me just say that they have the best dim sum I have ever had the privilege of eating, they were cooked to perfection: tasty, steamy and juicy. I arrived here by recommendation and it more than fulfilled my hunger. The food was delicious, I had pan fried noodles, a side of rice and dim sum. The service was excellent and amiable. Don't be fooled by the name, ""joe"" this place is good, authentic and surprisingly inexpensive. I recommend everyone that is in the area, whether visiting NYC or not to stop by and enjoy the food.",1
"Incredible dumplings

I went here with my girlfriend on a Saturday around 2. After a 20 minute wait, we were sat at a table for 6 with a family in the loud and crowded restaurant. The noise and bustle, which would have been annoying at most places, is all part of the Joe's charm. 

We had heard that the dumplings were the things to get here and we were not wrong. We split an order of fried pork dumplings and an order of the soup dumplings. Neither disappointed. 

The fried pork dumplings had a great doughy shell. It was perfectly chewy on one side, but fried and crispy on the other. While these were great, it was the soup dumplings that really stole the show. I had never had soup dumplings before, so that may have been part of my amazement, but these were the single best thing I have had in a long time. I don't want to describe them here because I would do them a disservice...

By the time we had eaten the dumplings we were full so did not have a main course, however all entrees we saw looked great and we will definitely be back!",1
Stopped by for dinner while in the City...love the XLB (Xiao long Bao).  They are some of the best I've had.  Their rice cakes with pork and vegetables was very good as well.  Stop by if you are in the mood for good Chinese food but be ready to wait in line.,1
"Amazing pork soup dumplings, I would actually travel all the way from DC to eat these if I craved it badly enough (I did once). 

Also got a spicy whole fried fish once that was AMAZING. Mixed the sauce with some white rice and fell into the most amazing food coma later.",1
"Home of the xiao long bao.  The ratio of soup of soup:meat:filling is spot on.  With a nice draw of umami on the first slurp.  I prefer the pork only.  

I also had the Shanghai noodles with shrimp.  The serving was surprisingly generous and the flavor was very nice.  The food is a little heavy/with a lot of oil.

You definitely feel rushed to eat/order.  If you come with a small group, expect a communal table.",1
"Yummy soup dumplings
Made fresh, filled with meaty broth
Almost burned my mouth

Like the haiku?  What makes this place great is that it's easy to find and the dumplings were the best thing we ordered.  We made the mistake by ordering some other dish on the menu and weren't as impressed.  So stick to the xiao long bao and you're all good.  

TIP: Don't be eager like me and attempt to eat the entire dumpling all at once... you'll be sorry.",1
"SO GOOD 10000000/10 childhood nostalgic favorite dumpling crabmeat joint of all time. So sad they closed the flushing location so whenever I'm in Chinatown I have to make a pit stop. Other dishes like the crunchy noodles are also amazing. Food is quality, and that's all that really matters.",1
"Soup dumplings here are phenomenal. The other food is good but if you're here, order the soup dumplings.",1
"Like everyone else, I was blown away by the dumplings. Some locals will say it's too touristy. Disregard!",1
"We had to try a little of everything- the pork gyoza, scallion pancakes, spring rolls, and lo mein. It was definitely more than two small girls could take on. But everything was delicious. The gyoza and spring rolls were a tiny bit greasier than I'd expect, but still delicious. The vegetable lo mein was incredible. I'd go out of my way to eat here again.",1
"I was introduced to this place by my friend. Their soup dumplings are delicious. The first time I went, we only had appetizers. I couldn't stop eating the soup dumplings. They have 2 varieties, The crab and pork are my favorite. Will definitely go here when in Chinatown. Make sure you get a small table if you want privacy. They will fill all of the round tables. I tend to not mind having the locals at my table because I like watching what they eat and then try it. They can recommend some great dishes.",1
"CASH ONLY. They have ATMS there. My soup-dumpling-expert friends all said that these were the best soup dumplings they ever had. They are twice the size of normal soup dumplings and have way more soup in them. 

Wait time on a Saturday at 6 pm was an hour 

I got the beef noodle soup. Beef soup was nice and light. Beef good quality 

Onion pancakes a bit too salty

Service great. Very organized and efficient",1
Omg the soup dumplings!!!! Love love love! They also have a strictly take out place. That's always great in the run or a lunch run.,1
"The food here is amazing, but there will sometimes be a wait. Because of how busy the place is, they sometimes split a 10 seat table into several groups, but the food and price makes it all up.",1
"When in NYC, stop by and eat here! LOVED the soup dumplings! They're the BEST and so delicious",1
"I was meeting with some friends for lunch and decided on Joe's Shanghai since it's a popular soup dumpling place that's conveniently located relative to my day's plans to tour the city. Now, on my ride to NY, I watched a Taiwan tourism video that compared the soup dumplings at Ding Tai Fung to the ones from Joe's (03:05 on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXk0ZpPAGU0), and he said the ones at Joe's are like ""Paula Abdul's saucer nipples."" So I didn't have high expectations.

But they turned out to be really good. We got a tray of the pork and the crab/pork, which were cheap and delicious, although I couldn't stop giggling about saucer nipples the whole time. We also got green onion pancakes, and these were among the best that I've had, which is pretty impressive. Minus one star because we shared some beef tendon noodles but I saw no tendons (only chunks of beef) in our large bowl. We asked our very stoic waiter whether it was the right dish but he just grunted and walked away so we had no idea if that was a yes or no.

Outside of the food, everything else about the restaurant was pretty amusing. Our small table was seated at one of those enormous tables, alongside 2-3 families with their babies and grandpas. Our hilarious server wouldn't respond to anything I said. Whenever I asked for something i.e. a cup of water, he would stare me down and just walk off, leaving our group a little confused about whether he understood me or not. Lo and behold, my water would magically arrive at my table a minute later. 

Overall, it was a decent experience with delicious food that was also super cheap. The three of us were stuffed from the four dishes that we ordered, yet the total came out to be only $8pp including tax/tip.",1
This place is worth the wait! Their soup dumplings are really good and the scallion pancakes are crunchy and filling :),1
"soup dumplings are a MUST!! absolutely amazing, the room is a bit small so you won't have an amazing amount of space. however, big groups are welcome. a classic!",1
"BOMB 

The soup dumplings are to die for. I totally understand the hype!! The dumplings are also pretty large so it was very filling. We also ordered the jellyfish which was good but could be a bit more flavorful. The Shanghai thick fried noodles were so good!! Rather oily but flavorful not too salty and authentic 

Had to wait 30 min on a Sunday afternoon but so good",1
"Cash only. 

Their xlb are a lot bigger than the typical xlb. Tasty & always hits the spot. Would prefer a sweeter & more umami filling but these will do.

Place was packed so I don't be annoyed if you have to share a table.",1
"While it is not the best, it is very good.  I ordered spring rolls and general tso chicken.  the spring rolls were a little soggy, but the general tso chicken was the best that I have had in years.  White meat chicken, no mystery meat.  Good flavor; a tad spicy, but not too hot.  I think I have found my Chinese food fix for NYC.",1
I'm really bad at eating soup dumplings and the liquid always bursts on to my hand instead of my mouth (note to take a hint from M&Ms). But. These are goooooooood and worth the clean up.,1
This is the best place to eat and before I went I thought it was bad but after best place in Chinatown.  The food is very good but it's pretty big.  The sesame chicken is the best chicken you can get and second best is the Kung Pow Chicken. I would always recommend this to anyone that likes Chinese. Looks small but very good food especially the chicken.  Very good service and fast to get your food.,1
The soup dumplings here are pretty good. This is known as the place to go to in NYC for soup dumplings so you should come here at least once so you can look cultured.,1
"Does Joe's Shanghai really need one more review about the soup dumplings?? I kind of thought once you've had one soup dumpling you've had them all, but it's really true... Joe's is the best. I particularly enjoyed the pork/crab ones.

Other food was great too! Oh, and a tip -- apparently they always include the tip in the bill regardless of party size, thanks to our table-mates for pointing it out as we were getting ready to leave some cash on the table.",1
"Is there anything I can possibly add to 800+ reviews? Probably not, but I haven't read all of them yet.

I wish this place only served dumplings and you could get your own table. Then it would deserve that last star I left out since their non-dumpling foods are just so-so.

The lines here are always out the door so do yourself a favor and go to Joe's Ginger. It's half a block down Pell, always empty, and opened by the same owner/chef as Joe's Shanghai.

Bet you didn't know that!",1
"Terrific place, really large portions. Cash only, they have an ATM you can withdraw for a fee.",1
"My girlfriend wanted to try this place a few weeks ago, thinking it was dim sum. I got there first, and was promptly sat at a big communal table with 4 other women. It was a little awkward, but I got over it quickly. My friend arrived a couple minutes later, and we decided to share food.
We ordered soup dumplings, spring rolls, sesame chicken, and chicken with broccoli. Everything was amazing, and they served hot tea/water, which was very much appreciated with the cold weather we were having.
It ended up being around $40-$50, I believe. They also put automatic gratuity on it so just be aware of that. I was about to give them a 20% tip on top of the gratuity, but ended up just giving the extra % to make it 20% after I realized this. :) Definitely coming back here soon!",1
"My boyfriend took me here to end our night on new years eve. He had already been here but wanted to take me because he raved about how good the soup dumplings were! We had been to a different place w/ xiao long bao before here in Boston but he said they weren't as good as Joe's Shanghai!

We got two orders of crab + pork soup dumplings and one order of pork soup dumplings. They come with eight each, so we each got 12 dumplings. They were just delicious! So flavorful and also very filling (which is a good thing). I almost died when I finished all 12 dumplings because I was so full. 

And, just like my bf said, these WERE better than the place in Boston! I loved it here!",1
"Soup dumplings: superb. I don't know what you're doing here if you don't order the soup dumplings. Scallion pancakes are deep fried as opposed to pan fried, so I'm not a big fan. I definitely recommend their shredded pork noodle soup, but I usually come here and fill myself up on soup dumplings with friends.",1
"Really good soup dumpling! We tried the pork and pork/crab and both were tasty but I loved the pork/crab combo. The crab added another layer of flavor. 

It is a little weird that you share a table with multiple people depending on how large your group is",1
"ordered :
Steam Crab meat dumpling ( Xiao Lun Bao ),
Shrimp Pan fried crispy noodle,
Stewed tofu with Crab,
Beef with scarlion,

The steam dumpling as good as the old days , never disappointed. Rich crab meat flavor n meaty pork stuffing.

Highly recommended the thin crispy pan fried noodle , non greasy, it's light, with or without the sauce are delicious.

generally, all dishes on the salty side, good supplement in the hot day :p

"Btwn 4-5 stars, feeling generous so I'll round up. 

So far my favorite NYC soup dumplings - skin is thin, soup is plentiful, and overall yummy. We also had the usual eggplant dish I like (Yu Xuan Qie Zi) and they made it pretty good too. My friend got some lo mein which looked ok, but all I remember is we cleaned our plates so it must be pretty good. 

Def had a wait, not too long, make sure your entire party is there or they will not seat you. B/c it's so popular, they'll seat you anywhere, so we were at a 6 top and sat with 3 ppl from another group, no biggie.",1
"One of the best juicy dumpling I've ever had in my life!!!
must try again when I'm in New York china town",1
"Anything less than 5 stars is blasphemy and you should get your tongue checked for some kind of oral cancer because you obviously are suffering from some kind of condition that messes with your taste buds.  The small juicy dumplings are simply amazing.  Possibly the best you can get in the whole US.  From what I've heard it's nearly as good as some particular place in Taiwan.  Anyways 5 stars for this place.  If you gave it 4 stars, must've been the service, if you gave it 3 stars or less you should go to the hospital IMMEDIATELY to get yourself checked out.",1
We ordered Joe's Shanghai to our hotel while staying in Manhattan on business. We got a large variety of items and all of them were very good. I highly recommend Joe's of you get a craving for some excellent Chinese delivery.,1
Delicious and cheap. Try the crispy fried beef strips. Their soup dumplings are a must.,1
"The key to getting a quick table at an in-demand hole in the wall in Manhattan? Simply go in the middle of a weekday during a freezing snow storm, duh! My tourist friends and I were in the mood for some piping hot soup dumplings to melt our snowman layers and turn us into humans again. Luckily, there was no line and we were seated right away at a table for 5... we didn't even have to share with anyone! 

We knew we wanted soup dumplings, and we got the chicken and the pork. I liked the flavor of the chicken much more than the pork. We also ordered the scallion pancakes (absolutely delish), and took the waiter's suggestion on a dry fried beef dish that I would have never ordered myself, but really enjoyed as a nice contrast to the dumplings. 

It's always fun to introduce people to soup dumplings for the first time. My friends had a blast perfecting their bite and suck strategies and it was a great meal to fill us up on a winter day so that we could go back out and brave the elements. Highly recommend, but don't know if I'd stand in line for hours for it as others claim to have done at busy times!",1
"Love this place.
We were here on a Monday afternoon and were seated quickly but every table was full. The day before we saw a line out the door. The service is fast and friendly as are the other diners. The staff was happy to make menu suggestions and the food was awesome.",1
I love soup dumplings. Joe's has soup dumplings that are larger than your other dumpling shops. Very filling!,1
"Delicious and reasonably priced. The soup dumplings were freaking amazing (be sure to eat them in the way that doesn't land you to the hospital with 3rd degree burns) and the scallion pancake was one of the best I've ever had. Most of their entrees seemed to be pretty standard Chinese food you could get anywhere, but man..those soup dumplings....

Get there as early as you can; my friend and I went at 4 PM on a Saturday and there was already a 20 minute wait. I wasn't crazy about the crochety old man at our table.  The kvetching from him was constant throughout dinner (I need more hot sauce, where's my hot sauce?! Oh let me bring cans of coke to dinner so I don't have to pay for them with my meal...) the communal dining leaves something to be desired.",1
"Oh hell, how i LOVE this place....

I popped my cherry for soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai and NOTHING has beat it since.... especially, nothing over here in Southern California. 

I dream about it all the time! Every time I go to NY, this is first and last place I have to eat at.... that's how good it is.

Man, my mouth is watering... it's just not fair... mother EFF' I'm buying a plane ticket right now! now... anyone want to offer up their place for me to crash at??? haha",1
"I much prefer the Chinatown location to the midtown. This place is like a machine. You get in, they seat you, they feed you, and you're out. 
Of course I went for the soup dumplings. There's just nothing like them anywhere and other people have tried and failed to replicate these morsels.",1
"I tried Joe's Shanghai for the first time during Chinese New Year's in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. New York City had just opened indoor dining.

The experience actually surpassed my expectations. I was skeptical at first about a place with such a reputation and that catered to what seemed to be a primarily non-Asian clientele, in addition to the hour-and-a-half long wait. But lo and behold, the food was actually very good. We ordered the soup dumplings (obviously), scallion pancake, sautéed string beans, shredded pork w. dried bean curd and Chinese celery, and the Shanghai sautéed flat noodle. 

However, the service wasn't quite 5-star worthy and I cannot in good conscience give 5 stars to a Chinese restaurant that doesn't give you rice with your entrees.",1
"My first experience with soup dumplings and I loooooved them! Apparently this is the place to go. We also had some thick noodles, potstickers, and green beans. All were fabulous. I will DEFINITELY be back.",1
"This place gets busyyyyyy. Makes sense since their green bean dish and white fish dish were both deliciously flavorful. Their soup dumplings were meh, but their customer service made sure my water cup was always full and my finished dishes were picked up and out of the way almost immediately. I'd recommend putting a name down early on because the wait can go from 0-100 in a matter of minutes, and they don't text/call you when your table is ready; therefore you're waiting in front of the place for a bit.",1
"MJ's Star : 4
Price : Crab meat with Pork meat steamed bun(8) $6.65
             Pork Steamed Buns(8) $4.65
             General Tso's Chicken $12.95",1
"I'm a fan of this place because I enjoy the long a** lines where my boobs are pressed along a strangers back , the conversation w/out of towners that have never been this close to a black person (except that time during the O.J. trial when everyone was glued to the television), & the seat by the door where people stand & put their a** in your face or hover over your food while pointing & asking ""What's that?"" as you eat your Dim Sum. I've been to plenty of these places in china towns across America & I still will come back to this one. I even like sharing a table w/strangers while I pick off their plate & pretend it was my order...That always is an ice breaker & keeps money in my pocket so I can walk a block over for a cannoli & some expresso in Little Italy. I'm from NY & I love being on top of people, so I don't mind the crowd @ all...Yes lots of pun intended...LOL!",1
"This place really does have good pork dumplings. I am Chinese, but this is actually the first time I've ever had Shaolin dumplings! *gasp* I know, what was I missing the entire time? 

The dumplings were pretty amazing. It comes in this dim sum bamboo container, nice and pipping hot. The dumpling was cooked perfectly and the soup within the dumpling was delicious. 

We also ordered Shanghai noodles. It was soo yummy! The noodles were so tasty and the sauce is really amazing.",1
Packed when we got there somehow we sat down quickly! We just wanted a soup dumplings which were very good! Service was okay... asked for iced tea then was given Brisk in a can which is weird. We didn't realize it was cash only so just a minor inconvenience.,1
"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!! I brought my friend to this place a few weeks ago after finding it on yelp! At first, I had no clue whether if it's good or not; however, my parents told me that this place is famous and delicious, and that they even have it at flushing (if it's in flushing, you know it has some sort of standard). I ordered my childhood dishes: scallion pancakes, cold sesame noodles, and soup dumplings. My friend ordered sesame chicken and vegetable fried rice. THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE!!! So worth it for the price! I am the PICKIEST person with my scallion pancakes; I usually judge a restaurant by their scallion pancakes. THEY WERE SO CRISPY AND HOT AND FRESH AND THIN!! If you've truly tried scallion pancakes in Taiwan, you would know that it should NEVER be doughy, and have very little scallions. Joe's Shanghai NAILED it! Even my friend, who only eats american-chinese food, fell in love with it and made me promise to bring him back here to have some more. The sesame noodle was alright; they did well with the sauce but the noodle was too thick. The portions for soup dumplings, fried rice, and sesame chicken were HUGE!!!! Perfect, if not, a bit too much (which is never bad). LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!!!!",1
"Still the best XLB.  We try to stop here whenever we are in NYC, just for their dumplings.  Worth the cholesterol spike!",1
"In Chinatown NY, lays the home to one of the most famous dumplings in the world. The world famous soup dumpling from Taiwan makes a US appearance at the one and only Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown. 

Now as a lover of all things Taiwan (and since my family is from there) I've had my share of Taiwanese soup dumplings it also known as xiao long bao. This soup dumpling is one of the best that I've had and I do have to say, it beats the ones from Taiwan. 

The soup dumpling has got so much flavor and soup in the dumpling that you carefully pick them up and place it into your soup. Bite a small hole so you can get a little of the soup out and then pour some soy sauce and vinegar on top to add a little pizazz and then consume it all in one bite. Careful, contents may be hot but oh so delicious. 

Joe's Shanghai does the xiao long bao right here and man I'm so excited to have tried this place and can't wait to tell all my friends about it!!",1
"Food: AMAZING 5 STARS!
Staff: not so great. (Only reason why we took away a star)
We had the soup dumplings, pork and crab with pork. Both we're very delicious and juicy just like they should be. We also got the kung pao chicken, chicken fried rice and fish with rice wine sauce. All three were equally amazing. My wife and I are not big fans of fish but my mother in law wanted it. So we tried a bit. The fish was not fishy or even fish tasting. It was as if we were eating chicken. 

The staff on the other hand was just wrong. It started great with our waiter asking us for our drinks and right away placing our xiao long bao order. He showed us how to eat them correctly (plus, plus) and then he left and rarely came back. We had at least three different waiters serving us. Which I could understand if the place was packed or understaffed but it wasn't. Honestly for the food deliciousness I would go there again and again and again. We were stuffed, great food, great portions and prices.",1
Food was particularly good on the day we visited. Service is always good. Ambiance is very nice at this location. The only thing is that you have to wait for 30 min to 2 hours to get in. But that shows how popular they are.,1
"We have been here twice during our 2 visits to NY, and it never disappointed us. Although the place is small and we had to share table with other strangers, we didn't mind. We actually had nice conversation with our neighbors both times. Food is excellent. We always had pork soup dumplings and it never disappoint. We tried other dishes and they were just as good. We had tried watercress soup, scallion pancake, friend noodles, beef with broccoli. We highly recommend Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown (don't go to Joe's Shanghai in midtown, It's not the same).",1
Love the soup dumplings here!  The place is big and we did not have to wait long to get a table. The service was efficient and kind.  Pretty good overall- great go to for soup dumplings!,1
"Yup, soup dumplings are riiiiiiiiico.
I would skip th crab and stick w th pork soup dumplings
U gotta eat .em right away, else they.ll get cold
But believe it or not, even cold they were good and soupy
Sautéed garlic spinach shoots dish was really good
Beef dish w mini fish cakes was good too
Overall they have good seasoned happy woks sizzling flavors for all plates coming outta th kitchen
I loved it
Loved it all
Saucy, good sauce
Tasty, quick
Not that much love from th service but these guys work hard and during rush hr, there's a wait
So take th early bird dinner time slot and beat th crowd 
Yuuuum.",1
"Not sure if it's because I haven't gotten soup dumplings in awhile, but their soup dumplings are huge! My friends and I ordered pork soup dumplings, Shanghai style noodles, and a  cold chicken noodle appetizer.  The noodle appetizer comes with shredded chicken breast, cucumbers, and flat rice noodles doused in a peanut sauce. It was pretty good, but it was too saucy. I definitely recommend the Shanghai styled noodles (#122)! 

Wait staff were nice, but you sometimes share a table with random people if you don't have a large enough group. There are a few tables that fit ten people, and we shared a table with two other groups.",1
Xiao long bao here is great.  Would recommend Shanghai cafe over Joe's but this is still good stuff.,1
Soup dumplings were delicious. Scallion pancake was too. Cash only and automatic 15% tip included.,1
"I came for the soup dumplings, and they were excellent.
10/10 would order again
Fresh, flavorful and you get quite the serving!
I struggled learning to eat them, but will not give up, I will continue to go back for the soup dumplings.",1
I've been looking forward to trying this for months. Definitely get the soup dumplings. The broth is more on the thicker side than Din Tai Fung in LA. There's a lot of flavor to it and it was super good. We went during the weekend and we only waited for 5 minutes. The price is pretty awesome for what you're getting too.,1
"My absolute favorite!!!

If I could I would eat here for a meal everyday! They do get busy so don't be surprised if you are given a long wait time. The seating arrangements are very crowded. Most of the tables are shared. The shared tables can fit 6-8 people. Keep in mind that you'll be sharing elbow room with a stranger! 
The xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are a must. Please be gentle with them. The soup inside is meant to be enjoyed not poked and wasted. I see people poking holes and picking them up ferociously with forks....it makes me cringe. Simply pick up the dumpling with the tongs gently and place in the soy sauce to cool and enjoy!  

A few other favorites that you can't go wrong with are...
beef lo mein
snow peas
pork fried rice

Don't get too comfortable, this restaurant turns tables very quickly. This restaurant is CASH ONLY and gratuity is already included no matter how small the party.",1
wow! must try. the dumplings is what brought me here and honestly was worth it. so flavorful and filling. get the pork and the pork and crab dumplings,1
"What can I say that 3,218 other Yelpers haven't said already? How about thank God/dess for jury duty for bringing me to Chinatown to finally sample the many treats of this crowded, labyrinthine 'hood. Joe's had a short line, a cranky but efficient line management system, and fine enough service. You don't come here for the decor. Pork and crab soup dumplings are awesome, hot and steamy with great flavor. Scallion pancakes were solid as well. Nothing fancy, just decent food and that's good enough!",1
"Only got delivery from this place, but it is one of the best Chinese food that I have had. Their dumplings are amazing and General Tso's chicken is really good. Definitely recommend!",1
This place is super busy and they have a pretty quick turn around. Orders are taken quick and food comes out fairly quick. Now for smaller parties expect to share a table with other almost like when you have dim sum. We ordered a few things just for a snack and everything was yummy. Now there most popular item is the steamed soup dumplings. That was  the main reason for our visit and glad we got to try them .,1
"Dumplings are what it's all about.  Sautéed string beans are good too. But honestly, who cares about anything other than dumplings? It's the only reason we go there.  Pork, mixed doesn't matter.  Little steamed buns of deliciousness. And learn how to eat them right or you'll ruin your shirt and burn your mouth!!",1
"i cannot believe how popular this place is!  came here to eat with a friend on a sunday evening and there was a huge group of people waiting outside, but we luckily got seated straight away because there were just two of us.  i'd say if you don't want to wait, be sure to go with a small group because they always have a few spare seats at shared tables.

dumplings = good
noodles = mediocre

just like everybody else says.  but stop by and quickly order some soup dumplings straight away and they'll get it to you before you're ready to order the rest.",1
"Best Shanghai Dumplings I ever had! I love their thin dumpling wrap. I savour the soup/broth when you bite into it. Describing it makes my mouth water. Ah I better stop. 

You just gotta try it when you're around the Chinatown area. Price is decent. Before I forget this place is PACKED almost most of the time. Go during off peak hours or you will wait for hours. I went here once when it rained, and there was no line =].",1
"I came here for the first time after hearing about this spot for years. I was actually with a girl from China, so if that's enough credibility.. she LOVED it. 

The Crab and Pork Soup dumplings are fantastic. It's about $6.75 for 8 of them, and they're quite large. Filled with soup, this is a must order if you have never visited Chinatown before.",1
"Wow is all I have to say!

We ordered their dumplings - fried rice and Lo Mein (steak in both) and WOW!!

It was 5 of us and there was so much food but kept on eating because it was THAT GOOD!!",1
"Really good xiao long bao, with lots and lots of soup.  I also really like the ""kaw fu"" (sp?), it reminds me of what my mom used to make.  It gets really crowded and so you might have to share a table with other people.  And the atmosphere is definitely lacking.",1
"The XLB's are as good as everyone says. Bring your out-of-town friends here and blow their minds. 

As mentioned in other reviews, they do cram people in the place so you can count on being seated with strangers at the same table. 

I tried the XLBs, pea shoots, Shanghai fried rice and Kung Pao chicken. Everything was good but the dumplings were the star of the show. Next time I go I'm just going to get the dumplings. 

The interior's not much to look at but, let's be honest, you're here for the dumplings.",1
"I wonder if they put drugs inside..
so good!!!!!!
I came here like 10 times and never get tired of soup dumpling.
shit.",1
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! Best dishes are of course the oh so famous dumplings and the jumbo hot and sour shrimp! The only downside is the waiting line and crowded sitting area but believe me - the food is very much worth the wait!,1
"Soup dumplings are amazing, but the seafood ones tasted too fishy. The orange chicken had nice big pieces of white meat. Would definitely go back here again.",1
"The BEST soup dumplings I've ever had -- and I've lived in NYC for almost 20 years. This restaurant does have a massive wait/line to get in, and you can only pay in cash, but trust me, the wait is worth it.",1
"I've heard a lot of good things about Joe's Shanghai but wasn't planning to stop by since I can easily eat xiao long bao back home in LA and I usually don't crave it. However my friend kept raving about this place and finally I caved. 

We were seated around 8 on a weekday and it was crowded but there was no line. We were all starving so between four people we ordered four baskets of pork xiao long bao and an order of green onion pancake. The pancake was quite crispy and surprisingly not as oily as I imagined (but it was still oily lol). The xiao long bao comes nestled lovingly between pieces of shredded napa, which was good to munch on to offset the heaviness of the juicy fatty dumplings. One con is that the vinegar didn't contain much ginger, I'm assuming it's because this restaurant gets a large amount of non Asian customers that probably don't like ginger but I could be wrong. Anyways, the dumplings were so good that we actually ordered another basket after we basically inhaled the first four. I like the fact that they give orange slices at the end, it's a good palate cleanser after all that fatty goodness. And the total came out to be so cheap!! Will definitely come back if I'm ever in the area again.",1
"Finally an affordable meal in NYC!  Four friends and I shared a meal at Joe's Shanghai and to put it in their words ""how do they pack SO MUCH SOUP in one dumpling?""  Wait in line, try out their xiao long bao, and admire the craft - simply exquisite.

Everyone knows that XLB is the thing to get here...even Joe's Shanghai.  Other than the dumplings and maybe the green onion pancake, I feel as if the other menu item prices are marked up. In order to make it a complete value meal, we did not order any of the main entrees.  

Oh, there's a wait too...but I'm sure you already know that.",1
"I love this place. The soup dumplings are so good, the pork and crabs ones are the best! I'm sure this is like 1000 calories but it's worth it. When I'm working in NYC and my friend come to visit I always take them here and they all love it! Even picky eaters love it here! All the other food is good too but I could just come here for the soup dumps! 

Make sure to bring cash!!!",1
"-Very aunthentic chinese food, if you have a small party, be prepared to share a table with others
-WARNING: they only take cash so be prepared
-Food is amazing!!!!!
-Expect a long wait",1
"My favorite place in Chinatown. I've gotten off a bus from Boston and ubered straight here. The wait sucks but so so worth it. Get the soup dumplings, Shanghai noodles, Chinese eggplant and really anything! It's all amazing",1
"I'm originally from shanghai China where xiaolongbao originally comes from. Before I go there, I doubt it will carry authentic xiaolongbao. However, it surprised me. It is not only authentic but also, it beats most of the xiaolongbao in shanghai. We ordered crab xiaolongbao. The outside flour layer is well made. The soup, meat, and crab is perfectly mixed! Love it!",1
"This place is bustling with people of locals and tourist alike and there is certainly a reason why. The interior is nothing to write home about and pretty non-descript, the service is quick friendly and helpful if you ask if you get a waiter who speaks English. You might have to share a table if your party smaller than 4. 

But the food is the delight here. The crab soup dumplings are hot and full of hearty goodness(we had to explain to a neighbor how to eat it as to not burn their mouth). In addition to the dumpling was the Pork and Dried Bean Curd with Shrimp and Bean Paste, String Bean Szechuan Style (with Pork) and Seafood Fried Flat Noodle. Everything came out fairly quickly from the kitchen. (They must have an army of cooks.) The String bean had slices of jalapeño peppers but wasn't too spicy. The noodles where still firm and not soggy and the pork dish had a great texture. Everything was well seasoned, flavorful and not too greasy. This is why we keep coming back and willing to wait and only pay cash(they don't take cards) is the food. You come out with a fun experience, good food and fairly wallet friendly.",1
"So I guess this is the Chinese joint that hipsters go to.  No matter, the place was legit. We were visiting NYC and Opti wanted scallion pancake. This place had it on the menu so we went to check it out.  Great scallion pancake and great steam dumplings.  This was a rare treat for me and it took a certain talent to eat them properly but after a few I was like a pig in a trough with these little morsels. I also like that the table were large circular tables where multiple parties were seated at so essentially you'll be rubbing elbows with strangers while scarfing down these dumplings and getting totally messy in the process.  It's all good though because folks go to town on these dumplings and manners are an after thought. Don't worry how you look just go at it.  Good time. 
Cash only!",1
"Came here last night and was seated within five minutes. Note, if you're coming in a small group, say 2-3, you'll most likely be seated at a communal table. We were fine with this as it reminded us of our time eating at some places in China. Pretty efficient use of space. 

We saved our stomach space for both the pork and crab&pork dumplings, which were absolutely delicious! These soup dumplings are larger than what we're used to with pretty thick skin. Perfect for those that tend to break dumplings often lol. We also ordered garlic string beans which were simple and a great side to our XLBs. 

Do note, they included tip on our bill for 2 people, so make sure if you don't want to leave extra tip when leaving. Cash only with an ATM inside and outside if needed. Service is quick and efficient. Expect to raise your hand if you need additional attention for extras such as more napkins, water refills, etc. Standard.",1
"Get here early to beat the crowds and remember cash-only! Also, expect to sit with randoms as the seats are just in this manner. Don't expect good service, this is a Chinese restaurant, it is a get in-get out attitude. But for what it is, there is nothing better. The only thing you really need to get here are their famous dumplings, Shanghainese style pork/crab meat dumplings that have broth in them. They come out hot so make sure to poke a little hole and engulf with caution. This place is a must-try.",1
This is s good place if you like Chinese food and you like soup dumplings it also comes out of the kitchen fast,1
"One of the best places for xiao long bao in Manhattan!

sigh....if only that actually meant something. Even though Joe's Shanghai doesn't rank high in the grand scheme of all Chinese food, let's remember we're in nyc and not Shanghai. It's all about expectations, right? Among the other xiao long bao options in the area, it certainly stands above the rest. 

Super packed during lunch time, but surprisingly the wait time isn't that long because the waitstaff works efficiently to turn over customers. Definitely not the place to go if you're looking for a slow lunch with your group (you'll probably be sharing a table with random people). However, for decent Shanghainese food at an extremely affordable price, it's a great choice. My recommendation is to forget about the rest of the menu and just stick with getting dumplings. After all, it's probably the real reason you're going there, and most of the other dishes on the menu are somewhat underwhelming.",1
"Great food!
The Dumplings are so delicious, so does the drunk chicken~!
It's an amazing experience for Chinese food!

Maybe it's too populous. Sometimes they seemed to forget to make our order.",1
"ATTENTION NON CHINESE FOOD LOVERS!  

If you didn't like chinese food before, you will after this experience!

Yes, I did not like eating Chinese food before because I think the food is greasy and the flavors aren't of my particular taste.  And so when my local friends took me to this joint, I wasn't excited to go.  

We arrived at a hole in the wall, located next to a Quicklys.  Because the wait was long, we went next door to grab a boba drink while we waited.

When it was finally our turn, we walked up the small flight of stairs to our table and well, behold, there were other strangers at our round table.  Because it was so packed, we were told, not asked, to share a table with another group.  I didn't mind, in fact, I had fun chatting it up with them.

I got seated and recognized that I was a minority in this restaurant.  Yes, I was an asian person, in Chinatown, in a restaurant made up mostly of caucasion customers.  My pessimist side thought, ""how great can this place be?  If asian people aren't even eating here?"" (No, I'm not a racist and far from it, just aware of my surroundings.)

Anywho, the dumplings came out and there were bigger than what I'm used to in California.  OMG!  These were delicious!  And the razor clams!  The sauce was amazing!  Despite the sandy texture because they probably failed to clean them fully, I really enjoyed my first razor clams ever!  

The orange chicken, usually not my choice of entree to order was so good!  It was really crispy on the outside and the chicken was moist as you take a bite into it.  And once again, the pieces are bigger than what I'm used to.  I'm beginning to think ""is NY really bigger and better than CA?""

We had a few other plates that were really good, but I'm going to try and not keep this review longer than it already is.

SO YES!  If you're in NYC, you HAVE TO GO to this place!  It'll change your mind about Chinese food forever!  And if you already love chinese food, this is going to be your FAVORITE RESTAURANT!",1
"crab and shrimp soup dumplings changed my life!
I almost always order sesame chicken when i get chinese but upon the recommendation of a friend I ordered the green beans sauteed in bean curd. 
The plates were HUGE and yes its a little bit more pricier than what one is used to in chinatown but its worth it. I devoured a plate of green beans and i loved it. and i even had leftovers for the next day.
Their soup dumplings rock my world.",1
I came here specifically just to eat the crab and pork xlbs because they were so good the last time I was here in 2013. I can definitely say that they are worth it. Each xlb is large and the soup inside is very flavorful. I came in the morning at around 11:30 on a Thursday and there was no wait time. Service is quick just like any other Chinese restaurant. Make sure to bring cash cause they don't take credit card.,1
"My gosh, this place has the BEST dumplings I've ever had. Trying their pork soup dumplings is a MUST! It's a little tricky to get the hang of eating it but the flavor is delicious! I'll probably come her every time I'm in New York without a doubt! Their new location is pretty nice and spacious, and we only had to wait about 15min on a Saturday evening! 

This place is also cash only!",1
"Since my last review when I moved out of NYC, I probably went there another 10 times; pretty much everytime I go to NYC... This is THE BEST, period.",1
"Everything is authentic and good to the core. 

The sugar pig shoulder, the xiao long bao, tang yuan, etc etc. Too many to name. 

The only star taken away is because the joint is way too busy! I",1
"Love this place! But the only thing I can really recommend is the soup dumplings, which they are famous for. We ordered the pork fried rice, duck, and other dishes but they were just sort of lackluster. Nothing special. Also ordered the fresh ginger ale and it was OK. Not my favorite. The service is quick but not the friendliest. The person that sat us was sort of rude. I understand the place is packed but still, no need for that standoffish attitude. Will definitely go here again for the soup dumplings but probably nothing else.",1
"Ahhh, the shrimp in garlic sauce was so good! Liked my chicken hot and sour soup alot too. The black mushrooms were a little too big and impossible to chew...could have been cut into half and served. The one star goes off for my disappointment with the soup dumplings.",1
"This place is typically packed so while we got to Chinatown, our group went to put our names down for a table. After we got our name in, we opted to go have our ""meal"" at a nearby noodle shop. After we had some noodles, we returned to Joe's.

Joe's is a fairly small restaurant with not too much seating. We came here with only one thing in mind; soup dumplings!  We ended up ordering some scallion pancakes as well.

The soup dumplings have by far been my favorite. We had an order of the pork dumplings, and the crab ones. They were both delicious, but the crab one was my favorite.

The scallion pancakes were probably the best I've had! 

I can't wait to come here and try out other food options; the menu looked wonderful.",1
"Went to Joe's for the first time on a Sunday evening and was absolutely blown away. We came with a group of 7 without a reservation, so for future reference make sure your whole party is there before you try to be seated. The hostess, staff, etc. can seem a little aggressive but pretty accommodating, and they were able to seat us within half an hour or so. It's pretty busy, and they really try to get you in and out, so have a general idea of what you're ordering before they come to you. Even though it's a little overwhelming this is THE place to go in Chinatown, so it's a must.
If nothing else, get the soup dumplings. Also, know how to eat them so go with someone who does. They are absolutely incredible - we got an order of the crab dumplings and an order of the pork. In total we got 3 orders for our party, which was more than enough. We also ordered sesame chicken and beef with string beans. 
The whole thing was super cheap - $9 per person for all of that. And it's CASH ONLY so make sure you know that before getting there. I will definitely be returning.",1
Delicious chinese food. i love their soup dumplings & the mu shu pork,1
"The quest for soup dumplings continues...

Tip: cash only! There is an ATM at the entrance 

Food: 

- Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings): for a touristy spot, these are actually better than others I have had in NYC. Their version is on the larger side filled with delicious broth, and the skin wasn't too thick or doughy. Be careful not to burn your tongue as they come out piping hot! I like to make a small opening to let the steam out, so it can cool down and pour some of the vinegar sauce inside for the perfect mouthful 

- Scallion pancakes: pretty standard 

Ambiance/Service: No outdoor dining available. We waited about 30 minutes for a table for 2 people on the weekend for lunch, which isn't terrible. The place was clean, and the service was solid. 

Overall: I do like their soup dumplings, but I would come during off hours because it's not worth an excessive wait",1
"Back for the second time to take my brother and sister in law. Finally had the crab XLB. Oh. My. Soooooo good!!! Also ordered a whole sweet and sour fish- was ok, house friend rice was deelish! And of course we had to get shanghai noodles!",1
"Way too packed ALL the time and I guess you can call what they do ""service"". You will wait outside to be seated. The food is mostly traditional...but if you must order one thing, order the dumplings.
 I recommend going with a group so you can be seated on a revolving table that lets you ""pull"" whatever entree your'e interested in and share. The dumplings are a must. A tad too touristy though.",1
"I came with a friend for saturday dinner at 7:30pm and it was super busy. We waited probably 30 mins before getting seated and they asked if we would be willing to share a table with others, which we agreed to, but if you don't want to do this, the wait would've been longer. Additionally, usually when I've had to do this at restaurants I would share like those long rectangle tables where you're never actually sitting directly in front of people you don't know but here we shared a round table with a lazy susan, so it was a little awkward lol but my friend and I still enjoyed our dinner!

We ordered the pork xiaolongbao, shanghai noodles, and spicy szechuan style sliced beef. The pork xiaolongbao were huge and could barely fit in our spoons but were delicious. The spicy szechuan beef was pretty good too - very saucy and a little sour. I thought the shanghai noodles were not bad but nothing special - a little bit on the blander side so I would probably opt for something else if I came back. Overall, my friend and I had a good time and would recommend trying esp the xiaolongbao!",1
"Viva xiaolongbao!!!! Raaaaaaaaah!!!! A truly mind-blowing experience. The best of NY!!  Don't leave NY without trying crab meat soup dumpling or else you will be missed out on eye-opening culinary experience....I'm dead serious!

Food:A++
Service:B-/C+
Atmosphere:C

You are not an official New Yorker until you've tried Joe's Shanghai!",1
"Order only the xiaolong bao, the scallion pancake, the chinese ravioli with soup and fried quail. Especially the friend quail, it is so good that I went back the other day and bought 5 as snacks. Good spot for brunch but the wait is about 30 minutes to 1 hour when they are busy. The one in flushing has better Xiaolong bao but the location of this store can't be beat.  Also, be prepared to share a table with strangers because they mostly use roundtables.",1
Always love coming here. The food is really great if not sometimes a little inconsistent. It's fun to share a table with total strangers and strike up conversation (I've even swapped food with my neighbor...to the horror of my friend). A great NYC place to visit. Going on the earlier side at 5pm is a good idea because this place gets very crowded.,1
"Best Soup Dumplings I've ever had.  They were literally on every table in the restaurant.  Took a little while to get in, but it was definitely worth it!",1
"So impressed when I came here! Came from a small town in CT and happened to get sat with a couple from there too. They taught us how to eat the soup dumplings, which were so good! The pork was my favorite. We also Got fried chicken (ok) and general tso's chicken (very good!) 100% recommend and want to come back!!",1
"Never fails. Got two soup dumplings, a pan fried noodle and a shrimp/pork dish. everythign was good except for the shrimp, surprisingly. It had no flavor. Come for the soup dumplings - everythign else is just ok. This place would get 3 stars, but recently i've been going to nearby places to try their soup dumps and theyre just not as good, so bump up to 4 stars.",1
"My college buddy told me that Joe Shanghai was the place to hit up for xia long bao and the Crab ones were superb. 

We got here right when they opened up at 11AM. If your a small party you might end up sharing a table with other people, which we did. It was kind of awkward since we were sitting up right next to them on one  of those round tables.

We ordered:
- Crab Xia Long Bao
- Pork Xia Long Bao
- Hot and Sour soup.

The crab xia long bao was pretty freaking amazing. Definitely unique, juicy, and full of flavor. The pork was allright. Definitely different than the ones you eat in LA.

The Hot and Sour soup was overpowering. I've never had such spicy soup and literally my eyes burned...

I wish I ordered more food, but Joe's Shanghai is a definitely do not miss restaurant.",1
"Five stars are for the soup dumpling and the deep fried flounder, both were outstanding. The soup dumpling are really something special!!! The Generals chicken on the other hand was just regular. It's worth enduring the wait to get in, don't ask me how they manage it but the do. Every chair is full every evening, so this means you sitting at tables in a communal way, so be prepared for that, also it's cash only. They average price for dinner is 27 per person so it's not that bad. When yo arrive, go in and give your name and get a ticket. Next you wait patiently out front; table for two maybe 30 minutes, table for four or more might be a bit of a wait.",1
"Honestly I've eaten more delicious xiao long bao/soup dumplings and I won't say theirs are the best I've ever had.  BUT theirs are likely the best in the city.  Compared to other soup dumplings you can eat elsewhere, theirs are more toward ""Shanghai"" style.  I love their flavorful and juicy soup dumplings and I would recommend you to eat, especially the regular pork ones are good enough.",1
Service is slow and there is usually always a line waiting but their soup dumplings are pretty good. Their other dishes are okay but definitely come for the dumplings.,1
It was a little bit of a long wait and the system for waiting was taking a number and it felt a little chaotic. The food was great and the atmosphere was fun; semi-communal with tables to share for smaller groups. The soup dumplings are a must try!,1
If you're looking for a soup dumpling eatery ... You've found it ... Joes reputation is very well known ... Must try!,1
"Authentic Chinese food,
Ordered 炸酱面，鱼香茄子， 蟹黄包：）； definitely would visit again if I come to NYC;
Just a side note this is place don't take credit card and only accept cash so make sure you bring around $35 for a group of two :) recommend: 蟹黄包：)",1
"An NYC Chinatown must! The soup dumplings were pretty impressive. It is, however, a bit wierd to think about how they are made. The inside dumpling filling starts off as a solidified gelatinous filling that melts once heated which is why they become soup dumplings. Although a bit wierd, they were still delicious and worth trying!",1
"Your two best xiao long baos(soup dumplings) in NY would be here and the one in flushing called Nan Xiang. I've been a fan here for years, strictly only coming here just for the crab&pork soup dumplings. If you refer back to my Shanghai Asian Cuisine review(which is sister to Shanghai Asian Manor) you'll understand why.

The rest of the food here pretty much SUCKS... besides their braised slice beef from the cold appetizer section.. I love getting that too. Other than that, pass on the wait if it's long and you're really hungry. Come here if you're just craving to snack on soup dumplings. I'm always lucky and never had to wait more than half an hour for seats anyways. Their crabmeat&pork is the best one in the game IMO, and I'm only talking about that specific soup dumpling... Theirs is filled with so much crab you could really taste it compared to other spots! Hard to decide how to rate this, if they should get 3 or 4 stars ...?",1
"If you love dumplings you can't possibly not check this place out. Amazing dumpling, they have each and every kind you would possibly want",1
Great soup dumplings and I just love the sesame chicken and vinegar sauce. The staff was even nice enough to give recommendations. 5/5,1
Classic old style Chinese restaurant. Food was good the service good as well. Dim Sum was very tasty. Good to try it once but it was too traditional for me.,1
"My bf welcomed me to this devil of a place-- We have been twice and it's seriously delicious. First, you have to get the crab and pork soup dumplings. Holy Moly, I could just eat serving after serving of that. 

We got several other dishes over the various visits, but the ones that really stick out in my mind were a chicken with roasted chestnut special (oh my goodness, so so good-- chestnuts were full of flavor and very meaty), a singapore noodle dish which was a little greasy, but still really great-- spicy and yummy. 

Still, nothing compares to the dumplings. 
Also, I love that they finish your meal with freshly cut oranges which somehow are always the BEST oranges I have ever tasted. 

Now, I want to come back...",1
"We took a spontaneous trip to NY and stopped by on a whim. On a cold Saturday night around 6pm the wait was around 15 minutes to get inside. I would recommend grabbing a menu and figuring out your order prior to sitting down. It's traditional Chinese where small parties might end up sitting next to strangers. Our xiao long bao order took ~15 minutes to come out but we had to remind the waiter about our scallion pancakes order. I wish I could review the pork xiao long bao we ordered but they gave us 2 crab ones instead. You can really taste the crab and if you leave with a burnt tongue then you know you got it fresh!

The service is fast so pro means that you'll always get your refills quick but con means right as you're picking up your last xiao long bao, someone's going to swiftly take your plate away and hand you the check. 

We also got charged a 15% service charge. Surprising to us (a party of 2) and kind of put a damper on the meal (especially when we were looking for something warm and cheap)",1
"Freakin' delicious.

But I don't need to tell you that...this is Joe's 4000th review on Yelp (literally I am number 4000) and it seems quite clear that the freakin' soup dumplings are freakin' delicious.

On our first visit, we foolishly opened up the menus looking for the words ""soup dumplings"" and had to confirm with the waiter that number 1 and number 2 (pork and crab) were what we were looking for. Yes, he said, those are the soup dumplings. And they were every bit as amazing as we'd hoped. For my tastes, the pork was best.

But a word of advice: if you don't know how to properly eat a soup dumpling, google it and watch a quick vid. In a nutshell, use the tongs to grab the dumpling from top (so it doesn't break) and place it on your spoon. Bite off the top, slurp out a little soup, and spoon a bit of that delicious vinegar on there. Now take a good slurp of the soup, and then eat the dumpling.

FREAKIN' DELICIOUS.",1
"Joes shanghai is soup dumpling heaven. Everything else on the menu is not really worth mentioning but the dumplings make up for it. 

You should get the pork soup dumplings and maybe a noodle dish if you need a side of some sort. I've gotten the pork and crab soup dumplings a few times but the classic pork is where it's at. 

When the dumplings comes out, don't pop it all in your mouth like a fool. The soup will burst out and burn your mouth! Bite a tiny bit of the wrapping on the top to let the steam out and let it cool down first before eating the rest.",1
We tried this place and it was decent. Din tai fung is much better. I don't believe New York has one so this place will have to do.,1
Went for lunch during work and it was packed.  Ordered the soup dumplings and they were really good.  Staff was fast and polite as well,1
The food was amazing and came out relatively fast. The xiao long baos were so flavorful and soft; by far the best soup dumplings I tried!! Although we were seated in a big round table full of strangers it was fine since the food was that good!,1
"It was 11:30am when we got there, and they open at 11am.  The place was already full but we had no wait, even though we were a group of eight.  By the time we finished, maybe an hour later, there was a short queue at the door, people getting tickets for lunch.  So beware, this place is famous and in all the guidebooks--come early or go off-peak. 

The famous soup dumplings are swell.  If you're a connoisseur or have a refined palate, you'll surely have opinions, and I suppose a blindfolded side-by-side comparison between the dumplings here and ones from Flushing (http://www.yelp.com/biz/nan-xiang-dumpling-house-flushing) would net opinions from me as well, but for most people, this'll do nicely. 

I think the same must be true of all the other food: folks who know Chinese food well or who've been coming to Joe's for a long time seem to note it's all gone downhill, but I had no direct comparison to the past and everything I tried seemed okay to me.  To boot, a Hongkonger* I know goes out of her way to come here when in town, and that's got to count for something, or it does for me.
  
Aside from the dumplings, my impression is that the food here is uniformly solid to good.  One standout from my table was the Jia jia mien--this was the first time I've had the dish at a Chinese restaurant instead of a Korean one, and I know it's originally Chinese but I like the Korean version better.  The contrast between the two was interesting, though.  The jia jia mien here was less tart, less dark, and much creamier than I'd expected.  If you love the Korean version, I'd get this just to compare.  If you haven't, it's still not bad--thick noodles topped in a soybean paste, with tofu and I guess pork.  Simple, but hard to dislike.

* Is this the worst city-native appellation in the world?  I think it might be.  The people of Hong Kong deserve better.",1
The soup dumplings were one of my favorite but we ordered so much because we wanted to try a little of everything the crispy beef and kung pao chicken were so tasty also some of my favorites from the 10+ different dishes we ordered all the meat was good quality and veggies were all so fresh it is cash only so just make sure you have that on hand service was fast but don't expect a server that is engaging they are there to get you in fed and on your way the food was definitely a 5 the service is about a 3.5 but over all it was delicious,1
"Arrived here and waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The seating is shared so you are sitting with a bunch of people you don't know. We actually liked this set-up a lot, it was unique. We started off with the soup dumplings which were delicious and then ordered the chicken and shrimp in plum sauce which was also very good. The service was so-so in regards to friendliness, but it was busy and crowded so I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Decent prices and great food. Two thumbs up.",1
"Definitely one of the places I hit up every time I'm home.  I only like the original store -- the dumplings at the other ones are either not as hot, or the soup (hot and sour, Hong Kong style) is loaded with pepper.  Admittedly, I only order three things here:  Soup dumplings, hot & sour soup, and Shanghai fried rice cake.

Super soupy dumplings, super fast service.  Me likes.",1
We stopped by to try the dumplings and boy were we happy! We didn't have anything else to eat when we were there because we didn't need anything else. The dough was soft but still had a bite. The filling was simply delicious.,1
I was referred here by a friend and it was amazing! The soup dumplings were incredible and so was the friend rice! I will recommend this place to anyone looking for great Chinese food in NYC!,1
"Soup dumplings took my breath away. They were so so good, have not found a place who can even compare. Affordable, delicious, consistently great.",1
"Joe and I go a ways back.
He was my first friend in Chinatown. I'd go to his place pretty often and always introduced him to my out of town visitors. 

All my friends like him too...although the adjectives they use for him might not be appropriate for a PG review. But usually we'd describe Joe-ster as ""f*cking awesome"" or "" SO good...so good."" 

My girlfriend also exclaimed,  ""OMG, that was Amazing!"" ...which makes me question what Joe did with her. But since I think of Joe as a gentleman, I'll just believe that he cooked her some fabulous dumplings!

Cause Joe cooks a great meal for cheap! My favorites are still the pork/crab dumplings and the green beans (a little oily but great flavor.) The skin of the dumpling is pretty thick, and I sometimes end up just eating half the skin and scarfing down the filling. 

Anyways, Joe's always been there for me. Like my friend Jane (http://www.yelp.com/biz/jane-new-york-2#hrid:-J7trffW_8Q0WX5Swx-xyw) however, he's so popular that he always makes me wait at least an hour before I get to see him. I sometimes go next door to Quickly (whose business is profitable solely b/c of Joe and their proximity) and grab a drink while waiting. 

Since he's so popular, you'll be sharing a table with his many friends, so don't expect privacy when you come here. Just expect to sit down in some close quarters, eat a ton of steamed dumplings, and leave incredibly satisfied.

What more can you ask of a Chinatown dude who came all the way from Shanghai?",1
"Realize that Joe's Shanghai usually has a lineup, that you may be sitting at a table of 8 next to someone you don't know and that they only take cash and you're good to go.

If you're reading through the reviews here you already know the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) here are absolutely to die for.  In my opinion so are the snowpea leaves, which since coming here I've been buying a big bags of and sauteeing up because I can't get them out of my mind. 

The service here is isn't typical American service, but more of what you can expect from a Chinese restaurant.  If you are rating the service by those standards, it is excellent. 

Come, enjoy!",1
"Ordered A1 and A2 XLBs and a scallion pancake. The pancake was super crispy and traditional.  The XLBs were for sure different; the wrapper was thicker than usual but surprisingly held a ton of soup inside, which is great!  Not sure if I liked the crab & pork or the original pork one more, both were delicious!",1
"I have been there twice now. 
My wife and I were visiting from Cali (the Bay Area) back in Oct. '18. Following a friend's recommendation all 3 of us went to Joe's Shanghai on a Saturday for lunch. Needless to say there was a wait but we put our name down and came back after 1h. 
My memory is a little fuzzy as to what else we ordered (probably just some noodles and a veggie dish) but the XLB were delish for sure. 
One order comes in 8, almost double in size compared to DTF and very juicy and flavorful. We are by no means XLB connoisseur but after trying a few places in the Bay Area, I can say that wifey friend and I were very pleased and satisfied. 

Part II - I am back in NYC and I wanted my first meal to be Joe's Shanghai.
Came here on a Sunday at 2pm this time.
No wait, got seated at a community table, got 2 orders of XLB & food came out fast. Just as good as I remembered it!",1
"Is there a wait? Yes.  Is it worth it?  You bet.  Decor is awful, the crush of tourists is demeaning, but my god, the soup dumplings are special.

If you really can't stand the wait, go to Joe Ginger right down the block--the dumplings are 90% as good and you can sit down immediately.

BTW, there's more than Xia Long Bao on the menu.  Joe's main courses are awesome too.",1
"Walking into Joe's was literally like walking into a restaurant in Shanghai- crowdy and loud, and English was a second, maybe even third, language...and I loved it all the more so!  I wanted to go to a place which serves authentic Chinese food in a place that feels authentically Chinese and this is exactly what you get at Joe's (despite the very American name).

We went here mainly because of their famous soup-dumplings, and just one look around and you'll see the dumplings are as ubiquitous as the water on the table. We ordered two orders of 8 each and they literally flew off the table. The soup inside is nicely salty and the pork is very flavorful- I could have easily eaten 20 of them! We also ordered the turnip cakes which far exceeded my expectations. They look like a patty with flaky phyllo dough on the outside and the shredded turnips on the inside. For the entree we ordered sesame chicken and it was so amazing we had to order a second one. The chicken was like nothing I've ever had; it was tender and actually moist- not dry and hard- and the breading was light and actually complemented, not masked, the chicken. 

For a feast of 4 our grand total was only $40. So if you're looking to have a taste and feel of China but you're on a budget, head to Joe's!!!",1
Delicious! Had an order of soup dumplings and pork fried dumplings. Perfect for eating your heart away on a budget. Just note to bring cash!,1
"As someone who grew up in NYC, the food is decent compared to other restaurants in Chinatown. The ""shanghai tiny buns"" is good but you can probably go to shanghai cafe or this small shanghai restaurant on Elizabeth St. for the same price and  ... without the LONG wait. 

I think this place is pretty overrated. With a party under 4 people, you would most likely have to share a table with strangers. If you're new to Chinatown, try Shanghai Cafe on Mott St.",1
"I don't know how long they've been relocated for but I JUST recently found it! The restaurant made such an upgrade and looks beautiful inside! 

Came by for dinner with my boyfriend. Waited about 10 mins. or so. They checked for ID and vax card, and was then seated. 

The restaurant was FULL. It was a bit difficult to get a waiters attention but other than that, the food was as good as I remembered it from the previous location, from the xiao long baos and appetizers to the entrees. Everything was delicious - XLB, scallion pancakes and sliced braised beef noodle soup. We left with bellies full and dishes emptied. 

Not sure if it is because of the pandemic but the gratuity was not optional, as in they posted it on the check. My boyfriend and I didn't mind but it was the first time seeing it for a party of 2.",1
"Fast and delicious food! Shanghai soup dumplings are the must. Loved the eggplant dish as well - it's got a bit of kick/just the right amount. The rice wine rice ball dessert was on point too. 

The mushroom and bamboo was a bit disappointing compared to other dishes. Bamboo shoots were too raw. Also had three salt duck or something. It was good but as the same implies, can be quite salty so would recommend having rice or some other plain dish to balance it out.",1
"Two words: soup dumplings. That's what you need to order. Also the scallion pancake and pretty much everything in the menu is good. Hordes of people and endless lines that are expertly managed and move fast considering the crowds. Cheap, abundant, yummy and tip is included. Heaven.",1
"this place is always a must when i'm in nyc. i actually searched for it for 2 days on my first trip and finally found it. they are known for their amazing soup dumplings, good sized dumpling bites filled with broth that explodes with flavor in your mouth! how to eat it - bite the top, blow on the steam, pour in vinegar and soy sauce, enjoy! i tried the singapore noodles last time, and they are amazing. they're like thick udon noodles with a slightly sweet brown sauce. the place is a true hole in the wall, so expect fast service that may not be too friendly but moves with a purpose.",1
"I normally think of Chinese food as greasy peasant food and so it means something when I say this place is above average.

Just finished eating here on a Tuesday night on one of the warmest days in 4 months.   Wait was 45 minutes and the crowd was one of the most diverse dining crowds I've seen in NY. 

I tripped out on having to share a large family style table w/ strangers but that made it pretty interesting.  No big deal. 

Crab/pork dumpling is a must have.    All other dishes seemed on point and looked just a notch better than other chinese places.",1
"Joe's Shanghai was recommended to us by some friends that raves about their soup dumplings. We've never had soup dumplings before and let me tell you, they are AMAZING! The restaurant was crowded the entire time, which to me means they are obviously doing something right. We also ordered spring rolls, general tso chicken, and chicken lo mein. The spring roll was large and yummy and the general tso chicken and lo mein was the best I've ever had (and I LOVE oriental food). I've been thinking about the food since the moment we left. Do yourself a favor and check it out!",1
"I've taken a bunch of friends and family here often and everyone stuffs themselves silly.  You must get the usual, which is the crab and pork soup dumplings, that I have for an appetizer.  I always order the shredded beef which is sooo crunchy and good.  Everytime I order it, people sitting next to me ask what the name of my dish is.  Today, I was pleasantly surprised when my friend ordered this tofu dish that I never tried.  Again, everyone started ordering the same foods we ordered.  Another favorite is this thick udon-like fried noodle with seafood.  I don't know the name but the waiters usually figure out what I want.  A must-go.....period!",1
"The place where the epitome of soup dumplings in NYC can be found.  My boyfriend and I love this place.  We have a ritual of getting stuffed here on a Saturday right after they open with 1-2 orders of the pork soup dumplings and a big bowl of the noodles with shredded pickled cabbage, then digesting in the foot massage place next door.  We never spend more than $20 to have a great meal.  I always feel sad for the people who eat there and don't have any soup dumplings, and instead have the horrible americanized chinese food offerings.  What a waste.  Definitely try their noodles if you're looking to try something new here- they're super tasty, filling, and cheap!

Word of warning- NEVER go to the location in uptown!  It is a pale imitation of the chinatown joint, even the dumplings seem off.  Maybe they're not as fresh.",1
"Their infamous soup dumplings live up to the hype-- huge, supple, and properly juicy with a generous amount of soup and filling. This is the one item to try if you visit!

A solid spot in Chinatown for Shanghainese food that's great for groups at any time of the day. I came with friends on a Friday night right before closing time and it was still very busy inside. We ordered the pork soup dumplings and stir fried rice cakes with vegetables.

The soup dumplings were great and bigger than I expected with a proper amount of soup, definitely the star of the show. Paired with vinegar and ginger, these dumplings are so satisfying and delicious. The rice cakes were just okay-- not that chewy or flavorful on their own. I'd probably just order the soup dumplings if I were to come again. 

Every order comes with orange slices at the end of your meal for a nice refreshing fruity finish! It is cash only so be sure to come prepared!",1
"Best Chinese food in the city. Really fast, too. You may have to share a table, because they are so packed.",1
"No reservations and cash only !!

Their XLBs were way better than Din Tai Fung's not gonna lie And the crepes/wraps for the Peking duck were perfectly thin!",1
Staff wasn't very friendly but food was amazing per usual. We got soup dumplings and Chinese greens. Really flavorful and didn't wait too long for the food.,1
Joe' Shanghai has great food and wonderful service! We waited about 40 minutes for a shared table but it was worth it! We were told they are famous for their dumplings and they didn't disappoint!,1
"My only ""must visit"" restaurant when I visit New York. It's a 100% no frills experience hidden in the back alleys of Chinatown and I LOVE IT. The lines are long, they only take cash, they automatically add a 15% tip to your bill, you have to share a table with random other patrons at times, and they yell at you in Chinese (just a little lol)...But everything is forgiven because their XLB is where it's at. 

I don't worry about ordering anything else except the Xiao Long Bao (at least one tray per person) and the scallion pancakes. My family has ordered other items off the menu that were good (sweet and sour fish in particular is excellent), but in my humble opinion, don't waste valuable stomach space. Focus on the Xiao Long Bao - you're in it to win it! 

There's also a rolled ice cream place, Juicy Spot, down the road that's open late if you need dessert. Ferre-Roll Rocher is my fave!",1
"I had heard about this place for a while, this seemingly-mythical restaurant with NYC's ""best"" xiao long bao (soup-filled mini-buns). Hadn't gotten around to trying it until a friend suggested it off-hand. I'm glad I finally got to go!

The line at the door might look intimidating, but actually moves fairly quickly (if you're dying of boredom but still really want the food (which you should), go to the bubble tea shop next door or something!). As soon as we sat down, the waiters asked us how many baskets of xiao long bao we wanted: a good sign.

In the end, four of us ended up eating 5 orders of xiao long bao, plus a small serving of the dan dan noodles. The xiao long bao ARE as good as people say they are; they're filled with soup and are incredibly savory. They aren't artificial looking/tasting, with the fakely fluffy white skins; instead, they look and taste completely homemade. I personally enjoyed the traditional and the ones with crab meat equally, but two of my friends thought the crab was a bit overwhelming and instead just devoured the traditional ones. And the whole bill wasn't too bad: $50 total including tax and tip!

Definitely stop by here if you have a chance!",1
"While this is touristy and the service is average, the food is really good. The dumplings are amazing and worth lining up for. Have been back to Joe's on a few occasions. It's always a great place to take guests who are in town and then pop round to Apotheke for a drink afterwards.",1
"Cash only. 

Came here on the insistence of a friend who is a die-hard Joe's fan. I was kind of freaked out by the C hygiene rating (From Serious Eats: A letter grade of 'C' indicates more than 28 health code violations. For instance, sanitation violations at this level sound like ""Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas;"" ""Hand washing facility not provided in or near food preparation area and toilet room;"" or ""Food item spoiled, adulterated, contaminated or cross-contaminated."")

There's often a wait, you get a deli-style-number and wait to be called, you're often sat at tables with other guests. 

When you're seated, you'll be given hot tea and asked if you want to order the dumpling they're famous for while you choose other food from the menu. Choose from pork or crab, we had pork. The steamer basket comes out promptly with 8 plump dumplings filled with a savory broth and meat filing. 

Pick up a dumpling and place it in your soup spoon. Nibble a small hole or poke a hole with your chopstick and slurp out the hot broth. Very tasty. 

We also ordered a hot chicken dish with cucumber which sounds weird but was actually my favorite part of lunch. The scallion pancake was tasty. Flat friend Shanghai noodles were fine, nothing memorable. 

I would probably visit again but I'd like to see the hygiene rating improve. For what it's worth, none of us got sick :)",1
"I see why so many people love this place. The service was prompt, attentive and welcoming. More importantly the food was DIVINE. Had one of the noodle dishes and I'm still dreaming of the amazing flavor ...and as a midwesterner, I had to get the old standby of orange chicken - Yes, I realize it's a contrived dish. I don't care. It was SCRUMPTIOUS.",1
"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in New York. We always get their pork soup dumplings, of course. They're a must order. We've tried their crab and pork ones before but felt that their pork ones are better. The soup inside the dumplings is a tiny bit greasy, but otherwise the skin is thin and chewy and the meat inside is wholesome without extraneous fat and grit.

We are also big fans of their chicken fried rice, which we always ask to be done without soysauce. Topped with white pepper, it's the perfect amount of not salty. We usually order a dish of garlic stir-fried veggies, whatever they have fresh at the moment. Their water spinach and watercress are both delicate and fresh.

I've tried their noodles before, both the panfried on both sides kind and the thick kind, and they're both good but I think you should save your stomach for other things unless you're really craving noodles.

We've also tried their General Tso's chicken (don't judge), which is pretty good too. We've also tried their long neck clams done in black bean sauce, which were also pretty good and not too expensive.

This place is always reasonably priced. One thing that most people don't notice is that tip is already included in your bill. I think there's some fine print on the menu that says that and maybe even some signs on the wall. I don't remember if the receipt does. So thank me for saving you guys from paying tip twice!",1
"Joe's Shanghai is probably the most touristy chinese food place in NYC, well - knowned for their xiao long baos ( soup dumplings) , its a spot to check out at least once whether you live in NYC or just visiting.

what is a soup dumpling? - its a soup filled dumping that you must eat with a spoon because the hot soup will come gushing out... 

i must agree with other yelpers as in that there ARE better places for soup dumplings IE los angeles( ding tai fung) or Asia. but we are in NYC and its good enough!

they also have an assortment of traditional chinese starter dishes ranging from marinated cold cut beef to scallion pancakes.

my favorite was the crab and port dumplings, they are a must try,

ps send me a message if you want to know HOW they get the SOUP in the bun =)",1
"xiao long bao, onion pancakes, and noodle soup with pork and pickled veggies are always ALWAYS on our table when we come here. and my boyfriend and i come here almost every week, if not, every other week. i was pretty excited to find a place that had shanghai food, as the noodle soup is my type of comfort food.

we come here so much, the servers know us by now.

and they seat you chinese style, which is at a huge table with other groups of people. it's always funny to listen to the haoles explain to their other haole friends how to eat the dumplings. 

case in point, one time this lady was sitting with her husband and as she poured massive amounts of salt on her dumplings, on her chicken corn soup, and on her fried rice, she announced, ""THIS IS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD EVER!"" then she proceeded to pour sugar IN HER TEA. absolute sacrilege. and her husband kept spilling the soup from the dumplings onto his place. i just laughed silently and looked at my boyfriend with rolled eyes.

ps avoid the uptown location at all costs. it is of no comparison and it sucks donkey balls.",1
"This was my first time having authentic Xiao Long Baos (soup dumplings) and it definitely did not disappoint.

I highly recommend trying their soup dumplings as it seems that its the star of the show at their restaurant.

My table ordered both the pork and crab soup dumplings; most of us enjoyed the pork over the crab dumplings. However, I enjoyed both just the same. The crab soup dumpling has a very pungent punch of crab tasting, so it may seem harder to digest or enjoy. 

My table also ordered their other dishes as well, they were alright... nothing special. I would definitely just recommend having their soup dumplings.

I would give this review a full 5 stars for their soup dumplings but unfortunately will have to only give 4 as the servers were rude and got annoyed every time we asked for/about something.",1
"Walking onto Pell street where this restaurant is located made me feel like I was in the allies of Beijing. The line for joes was out the door. Though the wait time wasn't too shabby. Waited about 10 minutes. I'm not a big fan of Chinese food. I'll have it like once in a blue. Though with the Chinese New Year being celebrated I suddenly had a craving. The food here was good. The portions are nicely sized. I ordered shrimp fried rice and vegetable lo mein. My two favorite Chinese food items. The service was good, nice guys! Upon bringing the check, they slice oranges  and give them as a dessert. If I'm ever in the mood for Chinese, this will be the place I'll be heading to for it.",1
Amazing food!!! Crab and pork dumplings were to die for! Like a little hidden Jem and the service so so fast.,1
My fav crab soup dumplings. Great cold n hot dishes. It's packed now so good. Cash only,1
"As we drove back to New Jersey in the Lincoln Tunnel, my wife asked me ""So, are you going to give Joe's Shanghai five stars?"" 

When she asked me this, we were blissfully full, having experienced wonderfully prepared soup dumplings and other delectable dishes. I was preparing to have dreams about this stuff. If these ratings were only about the food, Joe's would get 11 stars from me. But, alas... Eating out is about the entire experience. 

I cannot say what hasn't been said here. The food at Joe's is phenomenal. Soup dumplings are the signature dish, and they definitely get there for the Yen. So does everything else, particularly the scallion pancakes, which were strikingly comfortable like the Jewish version ... and addictive like warm crispy tortilla chips and cilantro-laden cool Mexican salsa. The noodles were al dente and succulent like anything you might imagine from 'The Sopranos' or 'Goodfellas,' but in a spicy Asian sort of way. The only weak area involved the hot & sour soup. If anything, it was a boring half-hearted effort. 

Service on our visit was quite attentive, and accurate considering we shared a communal table with three other parties.  And though the 30-minute wait could have been trimmed to 15 minutes with a little organization on the part of the hostess, I quickly forgot about the 30-degree outside temps when we were ushered indoors -- one step closer to dumpling nirvana. 

But it's neither the half-ass hot & sour nor the disorganized hosting that irks me. Believe it or not, it's the whole cash-only thing. And the automatic 15 percent gratuity.  Sure, I brought cash. But I have to wonder why such a busy place won't get with the 21st century and accept plastic. (I could guess why, but I digress.) The automatic gratuity pretty much defeats the whole meaning of gratuity. In fact, it becomes a fee when it is part of the bill. But, I was going to give 20 percent, so Joe's Shanghai lost a few bucks on us in that department.

Hey, my principles aside, this place is marvelous. Fun. Delicious. I'll be back with plenty of cash next time I'm in the area. This is truly some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten.",1
"This xiao long bao is only one that my son will eat the filling.  He's an extremely picky eater, so any hint of anything besides meat is a no go.  Other places that only have meat fillings, the filling tends to be hard and chewy.  Joe's has the right amount of soup as well.  Also had the nan goa (Shanghai rice cakes with pork).  That was good as well.  
Still one of the better scallion pancakes I've had anywhere.",1
"Saw this place with high ratings on yelp so we decided to stop by. Definitely didn't disappoint!! 
The soup dumplings were pretty delicious.",1
Amazing soup dumplings. The crab ones are the best. Also the eggplant is to die for. The wait is not to die for but can be avoided,1
"This is hands down my all time favorite Asian restaurant. Maybe even my favorite restaurant of all time. Their soup dumplings and crispy beef give me life! I have eaten here twice in one day before. Their soup dumplings are crack, literally. Sooooo sooo good. Their dumpling sauce is also incredible, I love that it has fresh ginger in it. So yummy and fast service. Highly recommend if you're visiting or need a good spot as a local.",1
"Oh my god, I will dream about the soup dumplings at Joe's every day of my life. Our wait was around 20 minutes when we arrived at around 11:30 on a Sunday. Service is rude and they aren't helpful at all but it just adds to the experience. I feel like it's better if you go in knowing what you want to order already, so all you need to know is that number 1 and 2 are the soup dumplings. 

My friend and I each got an order of the number 1, and a scallion pancake. We were stuffed at the end of the meal and only paid about 15 bucks each. CASH ONLY! 

I will be back when I return to NYC",1
"You go there for only one thing - the pork soup dumplings with crab meat... Best in the city that I know so far, even surpassing Chinatown Brasserie which I gave a rave review.

Your step-by-step guide to your Joe's Shanghai experience:
Patiently fall in line
Sit down
Order your soup dumplings (1 order can satisfy 2 people I would say)
Gently pick one up with your chopsticks from the top (the rest of the dumpling is too delicate)
Quickly transfer to a chinese soup soon
Poke a hole on your dumpling (I use my teeth)
Pour a teaspoon of the black vinegar with ginger sauce that they give you inside the hole
Chow with caution (it gets hot)
REPEAT UNTIL SATISFIED",1
"I have dreams about Joe's pork soup dumplings. Holy bajeesus those things are good. I usually take friends from out of town there and nobody has been disappointed. Yummy scallion pancakes, and all their chicken dishes are bomb! All white meat, well cooked, and flavorful. I love the family style seating. The wait staff are efficient and patient with tourists. Definitely a Chinatown classic, and one of my favorite places.",1
"Absolutely amazing food. The tables are communal, so it's not a very intimate dinner, but is great for a casual bite to eat.",1
"When in China town, take a break from your bargaining and have some tasty chinese food and a beer.

Don't bother picking stuff out of the menu, just tell the man what meat you are hungry for and he will create a menu for you.  Even if you want something else. 

-1 for cash only and stinky bathrooms",1
"Definitely worth the wait!! Best soup dumplings, we had the crab/meat dumplings, orange chicken, noodles (thick) and many other things they were all delish! One last things- we were a group of 14 on my second visit and they accommodated us!",1
Soup Dumpling was definitely worth it but what is underrated was the age shredded beef.,1
"Best place to get soup dumplings in Chinatown and tri-state area... Although, my family thinks the quality has downgraded since they've gotten so popular. They're always busy with a wait, but the wait usually isn't too bad since people know that their specialty is soup dumplings. The scallion pancakes aren't bad either. I prefer pork over crabmeat, but that's just how I grew up. The only other place comparable that I've been to is Din Tai Fung out in Los Angeles, and that place is a chain that's all over Asia. 

** For the newbies, your party will not get your own table, but will be seated wherever a seat opens, unless your party takes up a whole table.. Be ready to be friendly and experience the way Asians make the most use of space and time! 

How to eat soup dumplings:

1) Gently pick up the dumpling from the top with the tongs.
2) Place onto your spoon, making sure not to burst through the skin.
3) Bite the top of the skin off so that you can top it off with the vinegar sauce.
4) Slowly and carefully suck the juicy goodness out of the dumpling.. Be careful, soup is HOT!

Enjoy :D",1
"Of course, a crowd favorite. I love this place, always have! In the old location and new I would always want 2 baskets of the xiao long bao's. Typically i only get the pork one but this time tried the crab one. It's still pretty good. Joe's shanghai definitely uses thicker skin, but that helps it not rip so I'm okay with it. We got seated instantly since there's only 2 of us and its morning of a Monday. Usually there's a line and the larger your group the harder it is. Anyways I love this place. yes there's better xiao long bao's in nyc with thinner soup dumpling skin but that's fine. I love it all. NYC soup dumplings are just so good compared to rest of America. Apparently the ""large Shanghai xiao long bao"" is not the standard in the world... Poor west coast people got used to eating mediocre tiny Xiao long bao's from din tai fung. i want them LARGE like this! In fact this is regular size.  I love the hot soup inside!",1
"Such a great experience in China town, we arrived at 6pm on a Friday and surprisingly there was no wait (there was a line when we left). Shared tables for smaller parties. We shared the fried dumplings & shrimp fried rice, I would come back for this also! Everyone seemed to get the boiled dumplings, which also looked amazing. Totally recommend!",1
"Wanted good duck while up in NYC for the weekend, a Chinese friend recommended Joe's - she was right!

Middle of the lunch hour (12:30) the place was packed, but we got seated in 10 minutes flat. It is communal seating, so if your party is less than 8 people, you may have to share a table with another group - not a big deal for us.

The waiters are quick and knowledgeable. We wanted duck and asked for 2 orders, the waiter just said ""no, only one for you"". Between the basket of steamed pork buns and the half of braised duck, he figured we'd have plenty for two adults and a child. He was right, and we didn't waste any food, saving room for dessert on Mulberry St.

The steamed buns are a signature dish here and every table had at least a basket, some three or four. Highly recommended item, we certainly enjoyed our order.

FYI, there's no Peking Duck, so if you're looking for that, go elsewhere. For great steamed buns and excellent braised duck, this is our new spot in NYC.",1
"Seriously so so so good. So good! Best scallion pancakes I've EVER had. We ordered so many Shanghai dumplings and sadly nothing else. We were obsessed. Definitely the best, biggest, best-priced dumplings I have ever had. Also do not miss out on the fried dumplings either soooo good. Oh man, I miss this place already.",1
"This was our first experience eating in Chinatown and let me tell you it did not disappoint! Thanks to yelp I was able to look at the menu ahead of time and order the sesame chicken and my fiancé ordered the kungpao chicken. Both plates were super rich in flavor, by far the best Chinese restaurant we have ever been to! Be prepared to wait a while location is kind of small, they will also seat you in a table with others but amazing experience will definitely go again!",1
"My friend, who is from China, took me here for soup dumplings.  It was right after the New Year parade, so it was crowded and there was a wait.  We sat at a communal table, and things were a bit rushed.  But that's understandable.  We got crab and pork and just pork dumplings.  They were delicious.  I had never had them before and didn't know how to eat them, but my friend showed me how.  Now I'm a huge fan!",1
"All hail the Soup Dumpling !

IF you're looking for the most authentic Chinatown experience in lower Manhattan, there is ONLY one choice... Joe's Shanghai.

Rule #1

You MUST order the Crab & Pork Dumplings.

... but that's just the appetizer.  

They make the best Orange Beef, and I really love the pan fried noodles.",1
"I think Soup Dumplings are my favorite food.

I've actually come to the realization that buying anything but the Soup Dumplings is a waste of money.  Not because the food is that bad, but the Soup Dumplings are that good.  Don't get the seafood ones- Straight Pork.

The perfection of the Soup Dumpling actually compensates for the fact that the place received a ""B"" healthy rating (like most China Town Restaurants) and the fact that they don't take Credit Cards.",1
"My friend had this place on the list to check out , so we came and had to see what the hype was about! There was a line , but it wasn't that bad. You just grab a number and chill in the area!

We got inside , it was packed and we were bunch with different groups of people in one table. I didn't have any issues with that , cause I came to see what all the noise was about! Prior to this we had already ate a bit , but we wanted to see what's so good about the xialongbao. We ordered xiaolongbao and another plate of noods. Honestly both plates were really good , I can see why people are making noise about xialongbao, It was very very juicy. Prob the most juiciest I've ever seen from a xiaolongbao! I personally really wouldn't wait in a line again for this place , just cause I'm not a super huge fan of xialongbaos. Overall experience was pretty cool though!

*Be aware , if there is a line you might be seated with another group.",1
I've been going here for years and just had dinner again the other night. Truly some of the best and most affordable chinese food in the city.,1
"Because they are about to open a Din Tai Fung in Seattle, I just had to give myself a preface of Xiao Long Bao before that main event.

Joe's Shanghai has apparently been a staple in the New York Chinese food scene since the beginning of time. Because of this, its fame made actually getting the food an arduous task. We waited an hour in the cold  for a table to be ready at the Chinatown location. It was so annoying...

But when we actually got inside, it felt pretty authentic. We just got 3 orders of beef xiao long bao for about $6 ea. It was enough to fill up 3 people. Quality was good and things came out really fast. The only thing that might be a turn off to people who aren't accustomed is the service. Just don't expect happy faces when you come to dine here. Just get in, sit down, order your food, pay, then leave. The servers will appreciate that the most.

BTW: CASH ONLY",1
"Ive been wanting to check out Joes Shanghai every time I come visit new york but never got the chance to until this past trip! it was a Sunday afternoon so it was quite packed but the wait wasn't that long, maybe 45 minutes we waited? We ended up going next door for drinks while we waited. Of course we ordered the special pork soup dumplings! Now I'm from chicago and our soup dumplings over here can't even compare to new york soup dumplings. They double in size and is so delicious! we ordered a couple other dishes also that was quite yummy. Definitely wake up early to come eat here on the weekend as it can get super packed!",1
"I prefer Joe's in Flushing, but the food here was just as good.  We were also seated as soon as we got to the restaurant, as we came earlier in the day, between lunch and dinner.

Two of the people accompanying me were having their first soup dumpling experience, and were planning on sharing an order, but after having their first tastes, another serving of pork dumplings were ordered immediately.

One downside... we asked that all of the food come out at the same time, so that I could enjoy the dumplings on top of the Shanghai fried rice (one of my favorite dishes... so simple and so greasy haha), but I had to sit staring at my dumplings for ten minutes.  Hardest. thing. ever.",1
"As mentioned before, the wait can be very long so I recommend coming early or not coming super hungry so you try it out!

The service was quick and the servers were attentive. We got our food almost as soon as we ordered it, which is great since we had to wait a bit. 

These are the first *real* soup dumplings I've had and they did not disappoint. We did two rounds - one pork & one crab seafood one. Both were so delicious! 

Loved the noodles and beef as well. The noodles were flavorful and full of veggies. They were soft and filling. The beef was crispy but not too crispy that it was straight fried which is always a thin line at restaurants. 

The main thing to remember is to bring cash when you come here so you don't need to take from the ATM in front. So delicious and I recommend everyone try it!",1
"We typically try to get to Chinatown when we're in NYC. This was rated high by Yelp so selected this one for a try.  It measures up well with our local favorite Chinese cuisine (see my Char Koon review), some in family said no, but others thought it was close.  To be fair, more visits are needed for comparison.  The Soup Dumplings are unique to this place, and worth it just to try those.  They were very good, but you may hear so much about them beforehand, your expectations may get too high.  Expect to wait at peak meal times, we waited about 30 minutes for a party of 6.  They work hard to keep things moving.  Our service was very good and prices were reasonable, good for NYC.",1
The food is good. Dumplings are good. Be careful of using your credit card. I had a credit card used only at the restaurants and that same weekend shopping in Queens was used with that card!,1
"Fantastic soup dumplings, and really cheap! We (party of two) got lucky and happened to get seated in about fifteen minutes.",1
Dumplings are delicious. Highly recommend this place to try soup dumplings. We waited 25 minutes or so to be seated today!,1
"The wait on a Sunday night for dinner was about 45 minutes and as far as the food was concerned it was worth it. My family and I had a few entrees and some dumplings and the food was great.

To reiterate what a few other people have stated the place feels like a tourist trap and is way too expensive (even for NYC). Cash only is also a negative along with waiters who hover over you and watch you eat.",1
Ok so the food is freaking good...prepare to wait at least 15 mins for this place and DO NOT expect five star service. This place is constantly flooded with people so the waitstaff are focused on getting people in and out. I don't think that's a bad thing at all tbh. Probably some of the best Chinese food I have had. We kept it quite simple with our orders and got the sesame chicken and Kung Pao chicken (we don't eat pork and the vast majority of items have pork). The food is darn good though! Fast service and straight to the point.,1
The soup dumplings are a must - just order by the dozen! You will not be disappointed. The wait can get a little long but it is worth it. Weekdays have to be less crowded than weekends!,1
"I've been eating my way through Chinatown with a buddy who is a long-time resident.  He swore that this is one of the best, and I'd have to agree.

The soup dumplings were great!  I'm glad my knowledgeable friend showed me the proper way to eat them, as I would have had a messy and scalding experience otherwise.  Apparently you're supposed to sort of nibble at the pouch and let the majority of the soup flow into the oversized spoon.  For my fellow uninitiated honkies:  DO NOT just pop one of these into your mouth!  

I also recommend the spicy beef with sliced jalapenos; I'm used to these dishes being long on spice but short on flavor, but this version had plenty of both.

My only knock is that it is pretty crowded - but I probably wouldn't want to eat anywhere in Chinatown that isn't.",1
"Known as the best soup dumpling place in NYC, Joe's is definitely good and now earned its spot in the running as far as my preferences go. First thing to note- cash only, but this didn't deter the huge groups waiting outside from experiencing the crowded nature of this restaurant. 
We were seated at a round table with two other couples, which made it a bit awkward (especially since we ordered the most food and our dishes basically took up half the table). We tried both the pork and the crab soup dumplings, and I was extremely proud of myself for eating them in the ""correct"" manner - biting a small hole in the dumpling and drinking all the soup without spilling out of the wrapper. We then ordered the salt and pepper shrimp, which was okay, and the braised pork shoulder, which was delicious. Definitely worth a try if you're around Chinatown, just be prepared to share your dining experience with strangers.",1
Obviously the best soup dumplings I have ever had. Cash only. Crave it always.,1
"5 star dumplings 
2 star service
5 star value.

Let's face it, you're not coming to joes Shanghai for a romantic quiet dining experience. If you're like me you want get get here, shove some quality dumplings in ur face, and then be on your way. The pork soup dumplings were literally mind blowing. The crab soup dumplings weren't too far behind. Be prepared to wait and don't even think you're getting seated without ur full party there. Do not expect a friendly staff. Do expect to feel satisfied when you leave. 

2 other things to note: 
cash only
To my long haired ladies, beware that ur hair doesn't dip into the soup from the dumplings. The feeling it leaves you with later on is quite unpleasant.",1
Went here specifically for the soup dumplings and they were a solid choice. Do yourself a favor and love yourself a little and enjoy some soup dumplings!,1
"Usually very crowded in here, be prepared to share a table with strangers

Juicy soup dumplings

Crispy, flavorful spring rolls, and scallion pancakes

The noodle dishes were OK, but I think they're better known for their soup dumplings.",1
2 Words. SOUP DUMPLINGS. I have never had anything of this sort and now I'm on the hunt to find a place that makes these magical balls of flavor if it even exist!! Must have in NYC!!,1
"Three letters...X L B! The xiao long baos (soup dumplings) here are one of the best I've had ever. My friends and I got the pork soup dumplings and the crab meat and port meat soup dumplings and both of them were equally amazing! It was the prefect soup to meat to dumpling ratio. The soup in the dumpling was very rich and flavorful. We also ordered the spicy salt and pepper prawns and it was delicious, the prawns were juicy and not dry at all and the shell was coated with so much flavor. This dish can get too salty depending on where you order it from but not here! It was just the right amount of salt. Another dish we really enjoyed was the chef's recommended spicy schezuan style fish filet...this dish was sooo amazing. I've tried this same dish at other Cantonese/Chinese restaurants but Joe's Shanghai tops all. The shrimp friend rice was super good as well and paired nicely with the main dishes and was flavorful while not being overpowering. My friends all really loved the spicy chili oil that was given for the soup dumplings! It was so good that they were about to ask for a side of it to take home. I'll definitely be coming back!",1
"truly honestly do not know what the whole rave is about. after having heard from several friends about joe's shanghai and their dumplings, i knew i really had to give this place a try.however, went for lunch and tried their dumplings and they weren't that awesome. they were not bad but not that crazy awesome. the food wasn't trashy though so that's the good thing. and this is the first time i shared table at a chinese restaurant.",1
So yummy! Especially love the soup dumplings! Great place to visit when traveling & the bathrooms are very clean!,1
"Yes, this place is a tourist haven, but as a New Yorker I still love it. The soup dumplings are the best and their other dishes are really impressive. Highly recommend.",1
"The food was great! We had the pork dumpling soup, fried pork dumplings, shanghai fried rice, and the beef and broccoli. ALL were so tasty! Also, the portions are big enough to share. :) 

It was fairly on the crowded side but so worth it! (Mind you we did go around 5ish.) Wait was not that long either. 

I loved it and would go back again the next time I'm in town!!",1
"Hot, tasty, OG dumplings. 

Ordered (2) servings of the pork dumplings and scallion pancakes. 

Bunch of sake too. Finally glad I went here. Service is very fast and ambiance is like a nice Chinatown restaurant.",1
"Came here for the first time with some friends from back home. Wait was about 40 minutes for 3 people at 1pm on a Snowy Saturday. When we were seated we were paired with another couple to maximize seating in the restaurant. 

Ordered the pork soup dumpling and scallion pancakes. 

The pork soup dumplings were bigger and juicier than ones I've tried before from the west coast. 

The scallion pancakes were one of the best I have tried. Crispy but not too oily. 

Service is comparable to a quick dine in restaurant. 

They charge an automatic 15% gratuity.",1
I ordered the crab and pork dumplings . It was great and flavorful. The bathroom was clogged up . And it took about forever to order as well as get our food even though that's all we ordered,1
"4.2/5

restaurant was really spacious and clean inside, but keep in mind they only accept cash. they were very polite considering we were a group of 8 who walked in with luggage and no prior reservation! we got the soup dumplings, shanghai noodle soup, shanghai noodles with beef, sesame chicken, and fried rice :D. they were all very good and were brought out quickly

also the restroom is hella nice and clean. if that means anytning",1
"Every item I've tried here I've loved. The XLB are pretty famous so make sure to always order those. We also usually get the scallion pancakes, eggplant, and fried rice. This is a great spot for dining with a large group. Though if you're coming alone an order of XLB hits the spot.",1
"The best Chinese food I've ever ate, hands down! I've been here several times and the service and food is always spectacular. Waiters are very attentive and take the order as soon as you are seated. This last time we went we came on a Friday for a late lunch and luckily were seated right away. I have came here in the winter before on a weekend night and waited an hour and a half outside because of how popular this place is, so plan accordingly. The tables are shared so unless you have a big group you'll probably be seated at the same table as another group but it's never bothered me. The place is definitely loud inside because of how busy it is, so not a great date night place. We always order the pork soup dumplings and crispy beef which are outstanding every time. The dishes are a bit on the pricier side ($17.95 for crispy beef) but worth every penny. The place is also cash only and tip is automatically added. The service is amazing-water always full and empty dishes always gone. I know they have 3 locations, but I've only been to this one and you will not regret eating here!",1
"Excellent Chinese food for an affordable price! Xlb soup dumplings were my favorite, Din tai Fung who?",1
"Joe's Shanghai has some of the best soup dumplings I've ever eaten! They are bigger dumplings and come out hot and steaming. I would recommend the pork dumplings. Also, be sure to check out some of the cool dessert places in the area!

Tip: Be prepared to order quickly & pay cash!",1
"Love the Soup Dumplings (Pork or Crab with Pork), The Duck with The Pancakes and their Kung Pao Shrimp or Chicken. Can Have Enough of them, They're so Well Rounded on Flavor, Presentation and Price. Always Make an Excuse to go and visit.",1
"Of course, you must come here to get the soup dumplings.
The first thing they ask you when you sit down is if you'd like to start off with the dumplings first. My group ordered 3 pork and 3 crabmeat/pork dumplings.
Everyone finished it in a flash. 
We ordered loads more like seafood panfried noodles, seafood fried rice cake, mushrooms & bamboo shoots, and sesame chicken and shrimp. Everyone finished everything. 
It's packed during lunch and dinner hour so be prepared to wait or try to get a number as soon as you can.
It's a small place.
Prices are reasonable.
Many people here are non-asian though during the times i've gone in. Perhaps the publicity is what influenced such a thing.
two thumbs up!!!",1
"Famous Xiao Long Bao (Soup dumplings)? Of course this is a must. 

We made sure to get here early and were glad we did because the restaurant got pretty busy really fast. I know people mentioned it's weird to sit at a big round table with other people you don't know, but that's normal in Asia. Trust me...it's much better than having to hover over people while they eating waiting for them to leave so you can have a table.

We ordered the Crab XLB and the Pork XLB as well as some green onion pancake. Just a dash of vinegar with each soup dumpling and I was stuffing my face. Delicious dumplings. These soup dumpling are the variations I like too as it comes with thin skin and lots of soup. I've never been a fan of the ones with thick skin and less soup like Din Tai Fung chains serve all over Asia. I was happily pleased.",1
"It definitely lives up to its reputation! Hands down the best dumplings I ever had. The pork dumplings with soup inside were incredible. The fried rice dishes are also very good. Bring cash, no cards accepted.",1
This place is awesome. Nice and helpful staff as always. I always came here when i was younger so i do have great memories of this place. The food is amazing its so tasty. I came here with family and we all loved it. It may be slightly pricy but its worth it. Also this was the place that introduced me to glass noodles(no not actual glass that would hurt) but its super tasty. I have to also say that the seafood here is very good and this is coming from a person who dislikes seafood very much. Come here give it a try you wont be dissapointed.,1
"Soup dumplings were out of control.

I think they automatically assume any non-regular/non-Chinese/English speaking person wants them, which is fine with me, because they knew my mother, brother and I were 1. not regulars, 2. not Chinese (because unlike you idiots, Asians can tell other Asians apart) and 3. speaking the English, and preemptively asked if we wanted soup dumplings before we even looked at the menu.  The waiter did not prompt the man next to us for dumplings, and instead waited until he made his own order in a Chinese dialect they shared.  They did ask the two teenage girls immediately.  

I love their website's how-to for soup dumplings: To prevent burning one's mouth and to savor the dumpling, the preferred method of consumption is to bite off a little piece of the doughy wrapper, drip the broth to a spoon or suck the broth with a ""slurp"", then eat the rest. LOL. I burned my mouth off the pork buns.

Scallion pancakes, fried whole fish, noodles, rice, eat them all.  

A lot of communal round tables, and not in that trendy farm to table way.  In a no one gives a shit kind of way,  except the two teenage girls seated with us -- suck it.  They have non communal tables, but why bother waiting?  It was crowded as hell when we went for lunch, and even more crowded half an hour before they closed the other time I came for take out.",1
"I had to come here one last time before leaving New York, even if it was by myself and just to devour a whole order of crab and pork soup dumplings. I've been wanting to do that for the past decade or so that I've lived in New York, and it was totally worth it. Joe's Shanghai has become incredibly touristy over the past few years but its soup dumplings are still number one in my book. When with friends, I would order soup dumplings, fried flat Shanghai noodles with beef, a big pile of stir fried veggies (snow pea leaves or water spinach), maybe some braised duck. But I will always treasure that day that I sat obliviously among tourists who gawked at me as I devoured eight soup dumplings all by myself. I'll miss you little soup dumplings! Counting down the days til I slurp ya again",1
"I know there are thousands upon thousands of reviews. I know this place is super hyped, ridiculously crowded, and overpriced compared to other ChinaTown joints. However, despite all these things I wanted to add my two cents and say this place had THE best XLBs I had in New York.  

Lucky for me, my husband speaks perfect Cantonese and decent Mandarine. This, in combination to his charming personality, gained us a decent wait time of only 35-40 minutes on a Saturday night. We shared a table with 6 other people and we expressed to the waiter we were in a rush to make our broadway show in an hour. Our waiter was really attentive and we received exceptional
service as we really had minimal wait time from the time we were seated, to ordering, to our food coming, and the check. 

We ordered pork XLB, crab and pork XLB, along with the shrimp fried rice. 
- The pork XLB ($6.25) was everything I love in a soup dumpling and more. The skin was nice and thin, the pork packed a ton of flavor and was so moist, and that soup though. Man that soup was so good and rich. I seriously need to learn how they make this because I could eat these dumplings for days. You seriously need to try this with a hint of vinegar and each bite is perfectly flavored. I was really sad when I ate my last one because it really was that good. 
- The pork and crab XLB ($8.25) this was a close second favorite with pork of course being my favorite. The crab flavor really comes out and the soup inside was the perfect blend of pork and crab. As with the pork dumpling the skin was nice and thin and the flavors were there. It really is a comforting dumpling and my husband's favorite of the two. 
- The shrimp fried rice ($10.25) was the icing on the cake as it was cooked perfectly with each individual rice grain separated rather than mushed together or in clumps. The shrimp was fresh and cooked perfectly. My only grip was that it was quite overpriced, but hey it's Manhattan. 

Overall, this will be my go to place for XLB when in Manhattan and this has to be my top 2 places, second only to Din Tai Feng.",1
These are the best soup dumplings in town! The crab meat and pork ones are my favorite. They're so flavorful and I always eat too many. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Chinese food and dumplings.,1
"i have never been a soup dumpling fan. i grew up eating them from time to time, and i even have a din tai fung just minutes from my home...but still, i didn't see what all the hype was. actually, i didn't even know what soup dumplings were...i only knew what they were called in mandarin. and maybe because the soup dumplings i had weren't all that soupy.

until i came to joe's. i see why people are addicted to this place, the dumplings are quite tasty. i love the unique taste of the crab ones...i've only had pork before. they're really soupy and delicious...it takes a bit of practice to get the slurp and eat technique down!

you MUST have the braised tofu with spinach...it's the best dish there. well, i haven't tried it all, but i'm willing to bet it is! and it's always good everytime i have it.

the only downside, of course, is the wait. but the service can be pretty good...just depends on the waiter. the hostess is quick and efficient- just make sure you hear her call out the numbers or you might miss your turn",1
"Great food and fast service.  It's so busy but thier system of sharing tables with other people was a nice way to do things and keep service up.  The dumplings were great but as a new person, should be shown how to eat them, I broke two before I figured out how to get them.  Also need to wait till they cool down so they don't burn your mouth",1
"came here with the roomie, her bf, her brother and friends from college for dinner last night. let me tell you that this was a great christmas meal!

the place was packed and we were told it was going to be at least an hour wait. good thing tiffany speaks chinese, our time got bumped down to thirty minutes instead! once we sat down andy ordered an order of the pork and crab soup dumplings. and a couple minutes after that we added another order of pork soup dumplings, beef pan fried noodles, scallion pancakes, and baby bok choy.

now apparently there are a couple different ways to enjoy these soup dumplings. one, just pop it all in your mouth. but do beware that you will burn your tongue that way. another, bite a little hole at the top, add a little of their ginger vinegar, and enjoy little slurps and bites here and there, still trying to avoid burning your tongue. and three, make a hole in the dumpling, pour the soup out into a tea cup, eat the dumpling and sip on the soup. all great strategies to enjoying a soup dumpling, and i am sure others have thought of other ways to eat these delicious little suckers (pun intended).

i opted for the second version above and enjoyed my first soup dumplings experience! not gonna lie, i couldn't really tell the difference, taste wise, between the pork and crab ones, aside from the orange tops on the crab. they were very tasty and i like the tangy twist the vinegar adds to it. our pan fried noodles were pretty good, although we are all used to yellow egg noodles for this dish, not the white rice kind. and the baby bok choy was also delish, no surprise there bc garlic always makes a dish taste better. the pancakes have a different sauce for them as well, which i thoroughly enjoyed the taste and texture of all together. all if this for 49.80, including 15% gratuity, score!!! this whole meal was just very pleasant and i can't wait to come back!!",1
"Line was really long and it was super crowded inside but we went on a Saturday afternoon and waited for an hour for 2 people. The dumplings were pretty good but I don't know if the skin was too sticky or the steamer wasn't big enough, the skin kept breaking and the soup kept leaking out. The soup was delicious though, super rich in pork flavor and the meat wasn't too salty at all. Skin wasn't too thick which I like a lot. Tempted to try other things but only if the line isn't too long.",1
Delicious soup dumplings!!  My roommate and I pretty much crave food from this place 24/7... and manage to take the subway down here often.  These dumplings are amazing but everything here is also great.  We usually get the eggplant with garlic sauce - YUMMY.  Enjoy! :),1
"Joe's.. you are always true to me. 
Pork & Crabmeat Soup Dumplings. 'Nuff said. (2 orders is enough to split btwn two)",1
"I would give this place 5 stars but the wait was F'en ridiculous. I waited over an hour and a half! 

The soup dumplings was pretty tasty and prices were definitely reasonable. I didn't like that I had share a table with strangers but that New York for you. I don't like it when people are all up in my instagram business! :) I'm that Asian who take pics of my food. JK! 

Next time, I will go to prosperity dumpling as I heard it's the exact same thing with a shorter wait time.",1
"Long wait but totally worth it! This was the ""it place"" when it comes to soup dumplings and boy oh boy do did I love them! 

Our wait was about 30-45 minutes long, not too shabby, but keep in mind this was around 1-2pm so definitely not during the lunchtime rush. They give you a number and someone needs to stay close by to listen to them yell the numbers. 

The place isn't huge, so expect to be a little squished together, which isn't too bad. We had a Chinese speaker on the team, so communicating was definitely not a problem for us and so I can't vouch that they're English is good or not. 

The soup dumplings are a MUST MUST MUST if you come here. Soups are nice and piping hot, they serve complimentary tea, like most Chinese restaurants do, and we had drunken chicken (chilled). We had multiple ""layers"" of soup dumplings, most of them being pork fillings and 1 tray was crab filling.

The idea of the place is they ask you first hand if you want soup dumpling. PLEASE just say yes (since I recommend it -wink wink-). The reason why I say decide NOW is that it does take them a while to make. They do make it fresh when ordered. So before you even finish your ""layer"" of dumplings. I highly recommend you order another set (if you want) when you are HALF WAY FINISHED! This way there's no long wait in between. 

Instructions for first timers with soup dumplings?
First the tricky part if to get the dumpling OFF the bamboo steamer. This is hard because it slightly sticks to the bottom. They do provide a tong for you to use, but in my honest opinion, chopsticks were easier for me. So the really tricky part if to grab these suckers off the steamer and ONTO your SPOON!!! This requires some ultra awesome skills! 

After you successfully grab these wonderful buns onto your spoon nibble off the top and I mean it when I say nibble a small hole because next you're going to decide whether or not you want to put black vinegar inside the dumpling! I absolutely love the black vinegar with the dumpling, but if it's not your cup of tea don't do it! I'd recommend trying it with at least one to see if you like it or not. But if not skip the vinegar part and now onto the ""sucking"" part. What you want to do after you nibble off a hole on the top, you want to suck the soup into your mouth SLOWLY. Be careful not to burn your mouth! After you've successfully sucked out the soup you plop the entire thing into your mouth and chew. Make sure you can handle a bit of heat, because initially it's going to be HOT. 

After you're finished all these steps you have truly become a soup dumpling master! FYI for the crab dumpling, since it's nearly impossible to remove all the shells, there might be a tiny fragment of the shell stuck in the meat, make sure to chew slowly! Not that I had a problem with the crab dumpling here, it's just my word of caution when it comes to crabs! 

Overall excellent place to eat at! Definitely loved the homey feel of the restaurant and would totally recommend this place to anyone! I absolutely enjoyed my expereince here.",1
Food was INCREDIBLE. I chose this place on Yelp because I saw how many reviews it had. I did not know until I told my cousins that everyone knows this place!  The soup dumpling to me were better than Din Tai Fung. They were big and contained so much soup!  and the soup tastes fantastic. The shrimp fried rice was so delicious and tasted home cooked. The green onion pancake which I've had many times at other places tasted SO much better than anywhere else. Can't wait to come back here. It gets packed so show up early!! Staff is so efficient and super nice.,1
Start spreading the news..... actually it's not news this place has been on the off beaten map for a while now and it is known for its dumplings (Chinese crab and pork broth dumplings) to be exact and they do not miss the mark. Definitely worth splitting your wooden chopsticks open. Cash only and 15% gratuity added at end of check. But they have free views of gold fish and tea.,1
"Wow, look all all these reviews!!! It's true! Joe's is amazing! It's been about a month now since I visited Joe's Shanghai ans I still can't get over the incredible meal I had there. I've been to plenty of Chinese establishments in San Fran and LA and NOTHING compares to Joe's soup dumplings. If you are ever in NYC, please make it a must and stop by Joe's . You will not be disappointed. Oh, make sure you have patience to wait for a long time (during holidays/weekends) especially if you're with a large group. I waited about  2 hours. Trust me, its sooooo worth the wait. :)",1
"Pork and crab soup dumplings- enough said! You have to order that! Hands down, best dumplings I've ever had. Scallion pancakes were also good, but very greasy. Very busy restaurant, so be prepared to share a table with strangers, since they fill up all available space. Just had this yesterday, and I'm craving for it again today.",1
"Yes the orange chicken is better than Panda Express, in case you were wondering. Cash only, community seating, but other than that it's really good. Don't mind the sketch area.",1
"**CASH ONLY ** 
They have an ATM at the entrance if you need cash tho.
 
I really wanted to be critical, thinking this place might just be overrated and a tourist trap of some sort but right when I bit into that crab pork soup dumpling, I was in heaven.
They make their dumplings with love, and I fell in it. 
The soup is so flavorful and is a little thicker than what I expected. Tasted more like chicken broth, quite oily as well. But sooo worth it! 
The dumplings costs around $10. 
They're not stingy with the crab either but be careful when eating this because there might be some shell still in the meat mixture. I crunched on a few. The dumplings of course come with the vinegar soy sauce and ginger as well as chili sauce which had a sour taste to me. 

We also ordered the pan fried noodles. Light and airy noodles that pop in your mouth with that perfect crunch topped with the thick gravy sauce packed with napa cabbage, your choice of meat, and bean spouts. 

That being said, the line isn't really worth the wait. We came around on a weekday 1.5 hr before closing so we didn't have a wait. We enjoyed our experience so we returned on a saturday late afternoon only to realize there was a huge line waiting. We ordered to-go and had a picnic at the park nearby. 

The feel i got from the restaurant was authentic and you know they're working hard when they're eating from small plates from the kitchen at the front desk while helping customers at the same time. 

This place isn't the best for cleanliness but the food we ate here was bomb! This location is hidden in an alley in Chinatown.",1
"i feel in love this vegetarian plate instead of the dumplings. I don't know what it is called in english because my chinese friends ordered it for me; ""ku foo."" so tasty, sweet and juicy sorta like tofu.",1
Such a family style type place but you don't mind sharing a table with whomever after you start chomping on those magnificent dumplings. Yum.,1
"This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in New York. Their soup dumplings are amazing, specifically the Pork ones. While I have ordered other dishes from this restaurant (all delicious, I'd recommend trying them out), I do tend to only get their soup dumplings now as I pair them with other side dishes from various restaurants in the area for my meal. And the soup dumplings are always, ALWAYS, the highlight. Whenever I try a new Chinese restaurant I compare their soup dumplings to Joe's and nothing has ever beaten their phenomenal taste.",1
We LOVED this place. Soup dumplings were great. Fried pork chop was great. Noodles were great. Crispy fish okay. Sauce a bit heavy. Prices very reasonable. Loved the atmosphere.,1
The pork soup dumplings and fried flat noodles are delicious!,1
"Be ready to wait for a table and possibly even share a table with another party as the restaurant is tight and busy. We ordered two types of Xiao long bao, one pork and one with pork and crabmeat.  Both had nine pieces each and was packed with great juice and flavor. Wait time wasn't too long for food or for dining. The dough was just the perfect amount not too thick but large enough.",1
"I really like this place. The soup dumplings, scallion pancake and cold sesame noodles were all absolutely delicious. Icy Tsingtao beer is the perfect accompaniment. Servers are great, and the price is right.",1
"Joe's Shanghai certainly is an interesting joint.

We were strongly recommended to try this place on a trip to NYC recently.

We entered and were immediately greeted by staff.  They promptly seated us at a round table that already had two other patrons dining at.  The table seated 7 so I think they focus on a community type of experience.

There were three of us and we ordered one order of pork and shrimp dumplings, an order of Kung Pao Chicken, and a bowl of rice.  I didn't think it would be, but it ended up being just enough to feed all three of us.

The dumplings were amazing.  If anything, I should have had another order just for myself.  They simply were delightful.

We ordered the chicken just to have a safe, ""everyone happy"" entree, and it too, was delicious.  I think it was the best Kung Pao I've had.  Not ridiculous spicy, and the chicken was plenty filling.

In all, a great dining experience and I'm sure to stop by next visit to the city.",1
First of all this is a CASH ONLY restaurant and well worth it! Our entire meal was split between four people and came out to be less than $50 with tip included. I did not have the pork soup dumplings but the rest of the table did and they were WELL enjoyed. Be warned their soup dumplings are big so you might not have room in your stomach for other food. The chicken fried rice and the chicken fried noodles were amazing and well done. The food was excellent and the service was very good. We had a wait but it was WELL worth the wait for this delicious food and the price is unbeatable! Will be coming back for more many times in the future!!!,1
"Tourist trap? Yes. Still the best soup dumpling to be had in Chinatown. 

Used to have a friend that worked here, so I apologize if I've ever cut in front of you because of my connection. 

If you come here, and don't order the soup dumplings, then please leave. Not just this page, but get out of Chinatown. 

Another thing to recommend is the fried rice cakes. And here is a really good of the menu dish to try--beef with hot peppers. If you can handle spicy, definitely get this. It is banging. Sometimes it will be almost unbearably spicy depending on the batch of peppers. You've been warned. 

And be prepared for long lines. Unless you have a connection. Then when you cut off the 20+, feel guilty. 

And remember--you were never here unless you had the soup dumplings. You're welcome.",1
"Loved it all!  Fried rice, dumplings are a must! Sesame chicken.  Very impressed!  One of those meals you remember!",1
"Not sure why, but this time I went was /much/ better. The wait was ~45 mins for 5, which was not bad, and the XLB was much less oily this time. Super tasty yay! Also every other place in NYC I go to get XLB is much worse, so the rating has been revised to reflect that.",1
Delicious. Arrived when they opened so no wait. Dumplings were the best we had in NYC. Great service. Excellent experience!,1
The best soup dumplings I've ever had! I would def recommend Joe's Shanghai to anyone visiting NY that is looking for a good Chinese spot. The service and the food was awesome!,1
"Vegetarians and pescetarians - no soup dumplings here for you. I tried asking if they could make their crabmeat and pork dumplings without the pork but alas, they could not. 

My friend loved the dumplings. I loved the snow pea leaf dish with garlic (off menu but just ask). They don't carry Chinese broccoli, though, which was disappointing and surprising. We also ordered a whole steamed flounder, which wasn't bad, but not properly seasoned. The texture was good, but the flavor was not - way too bland. 

Overall, not bad but I'm not sure it's worth the wait if you don't eat meat.",1
"Cash only!!!

This was my first time here but it looked like the space was recently remodeled. It has a clean, sleek, modern look to it.

We ordered the Vegetable Dumplings and they were amazing! I feel like dumplings usually have mashed up ingredients on the inside, but these had cut up veggie pieces so I knew what I was eating (A+!). We also had Scallion Pancakes which were delicious. I ordered the Genreal Tso's Chicken and it was great - and big enough portion to take leftovers home!

Note - if you want rice with your entree, you have to ask for it!",1
"*CASH ONLY 
*Typically a 20 minute wait to eat at a shared table

All you need to know about Joe's Shanghai is that they have the best XLB (soup dumplings) ever. I've had many in NYC and around the USA, but nothing compares to here. The amount of soup in one of their XLB is double the normal amount for only $6. I gotta give a shout out to their wine chicken ($8) as well, tender with a pronounced flavor.

Meal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 9
The best soup dumplings at an affordable price - come eat here already!",1
"One of the most visited and recommended restaurants in the area. The remodeled location is much more modern and accommodating, but I do miss the culture found in the old location. 

While their normal menu is subpar, they really do a great job with their soup dumplings. Their pork and crab soup dumplings are little buns of fun. Each dumpling is filled with a fantastic burst of flavor. Top each bite off with a dap of vinegar and you'll experience a blend of savory and tart.

Come for the soup dumplings only!!",1
"Don't miss the xiao long baos here! They're definitely the best! I also like the kung pao chicken and the seasonal vegetable dishes (watercress & doumiao). 

Yes, this place is always packed even on a freezing cold Tues night.",1
"If you haven't noticed, every table with have the famous and delish crab soup dumplings. Best value in Chinatown.
I'll eve make a meal out a whole order to myself and a bowl or rice. 
Everyone has a technique to eating them. Definitely take a small bite out and blow into the dumpling before putting the whole juicy thing into your mouth or you'll get burned. Also careful not to choke on the black vinegar. Um... YUM.",1
"What's a visit to NYC without a stop at Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown? They have the most succulent Xiao Long Bao's this side of Shanghai (I'm assuming since I haven't been to Shanghai, China yet).

According to Joe's website - Xiao Long Bao or ""Little Dumplings in the Basket"" was originated from Nan Xiang, a suburb of Shanghai. Their perfectly symmetrical shape, resembles a pagoda.

Shall we get to the nitty gritty?

1) The wait is long. The food here is that good. Now that you're warned, don't be hating because you're impatient. It's not Joe's fault that you have Attention Deficit Hyper Disorder (ADHD). Take a chill pill. All your 1-star anger will dissipate shortly.

2) High probability that you might be seated on a big table with strangers if your party is three or less. It might not be your cup of tea. However, I grew up with this in LA at other Chinese places. You're here to eat not socialize for hours on end over bottles of wine. Besides, I've meet some cool people eating this way. 

3) Dumplings come in crab or pork meat. You can't go wrong with either but I prefer the crab. Each order has about 8-10 dumplings. Be careful when taking your first bite. These things are filled with hot, juicy goodness. Take a small bite off the top, blow some air in to cool it down and pour in the ginger/soy sauce for flavor. It's best to take the dumpling in one bite. Otherwise, if you bite it in half, the dumpling will fall apart and juices will everywhere.

4) Scallion pancake. Eat this while it's piping hot! Dip it into your soy sauce if you want. I just eat it as is.

That's it for me. I just eat dumplings and scallion pancake here. I'm easy like Sunday Morning.

Once you're done, pay quick and GTFO. Until next time Joe!",1
Soup dumplings number 1 and 2 in the menus and super filling I think ordered too much and the scallion pancakes are fire; waiters are always in a rush tho,1
Good food and portion size it good as well. You definitely get what you pay for. Soup dumplings are good and a must get item.,1
"We ordered the following:

Soup dumplings 5/5
Fried rice 5/5
Sesame chicken and broccoli 2/5

The dumplings are the best anywhere. The sesame chicken and broccoli (cold and partially cooked) were a letdown. Fun atmosphere, definitely worth a visit.",1
The crab and pork soup dumpling is really as good as everyone says. Full of soupy goodness and they don't skimp on the crab either. Although I did notice during a recent visit that they skimped on the ginger in the soy sauce dip. The eggplant with pork dish is also delicious. Don't come here if you're on a diet.,1
"This was one of my top foodies on my list to try while in NYC ! And I fell in love with their soup dumplings ! Omg the texture of the cute little dumpling was amazing, as for the pork and broth inside. It is heaven in my mouth. Very cheap also! I became addicted to soup dumplings ever since trying it here at Joes. The service was quick and the servers were nice and attentive. And yes it's very small inside and usually gets really packed that you have to share tables with strangers, but I don't mind as long as I get some soup dumplings in my tummy lol I will definitely be back whenever I'm in NYC again!",1
"Best shanghai buns I have ever eaten so far! :D They come out hot! The flavors of the soup and the meat are perfect. If you want to see them for yourself, feel free to watch my video!",1
"So good! Expect to sit with strangers and mingle! The pictures do no justice on how delicious the dumplings are! Expect a wait and bring cash. We got extremely lucky as we were a small party of 2 and came at an awkward time and were seated within 10 minutes. Lots of photos of celebs on the wall, so gaze and look around while your food is being prepped for you",1
"Yes, the dumplings were awesome like everyone says!....especially with the hot sauce on them. we loved it so much we came back 2x on our 5-day trip. 

had some pan-fried noodles as well (#143 on the menu) pretty tasty as well.

definitely worth the wait.",1
"Soooooo gooood! Definitely worth the 15-20 minute wait in line. We had the Soup Dumplings as a starter just as everyone should when coming here. Be careful if you've never had one before, they are full of sauce and you don't want to be wearing it for the rest of your day.  We enjoyed veggie low mein, sesame chicken, and pork fried rice. The Low mein was amazing the rice wasnt as flavorful but everything was cooked with quality ingredients you could tell.",1
"In general, typical Americanized Chinese food. However, they have the best soup dumplings that you'll find anywhere. Well worth a visit.",1
"what to order: XIAO LONG BAOOOOOOOOO!!!
tip: don't stray too far, sometimes they underquote and if you're not there- there goes your table!

My boyfriend and I got SUPER lucky and got sat right away- even though there was like 50 people outside waiting. perks of having a small party! woo! We saw a customer get into a loud, heated argument with the host for underquoting him, calling his number (which he missed because he went somewhere) and then gave his table away.

Also! If you have a small party, they will sit you with other small parties at one, big round table. So be prepared for that.

First off, I work at Din Tai Fung, which means I have had my fair share of xiao long baos.. but damn, Joe's just kills it. Their XLB are a lot bigger and juicier- there is so much more soup! At first I thought I wouldn't like that much dough, but I was wrong. I was struggling at first because I wasn't sure how to approach a XLB of this size but basically, you gotta just eat it all in one bite! Shove it all in your mouth with some vinegar and ginger!! hahah

I liked eating the XLB with the cabbage too! We ordered a noodle dish which was good but oily. I ended up adding the cabbage from the XLB to the noodles to make it a little healthier.

PLEASE COME TO ORANGE COUNTY!!!!!!!!!!",1
"We came here because a friend recommended this place when we were looking for a good place to go in Chinatown. We were looking for somewhere authentic and apparently this place was known for its shao long baos. There was a line out the door so that was a good sign. 

I wouldnt say this is the BEST shao long bao i've had, but its definitely really good. All in all, it's really good, but i wasn't extremely impressed. I feel like you can get this kind of food elsewhere. 

And service was really good! Not sure why people said it was bad. They were very attentive and the food came out really fast. I thought it was slightly strange to sit in a big table with strangers, but I guess they have to do that to pack the customers in. 

Conclusion: Not bad, but not over the top impressive either.",1
"Take a walk there, the crab and pork dumplings are so flavorful and juicy. I can see why they are famous. Scallion pancake was a bit greasy, but I still devoured it. Pork chops were really good, like just the right sweet and salty. I think someone from our group ordered the chicken on top of hard noodles, there is a specific name, and it was gross.. it's a small cramped spot, cash only, and like many little Asian spots order, eat, pay and go..",1
"My biggest mistake I make coming here is ordering regular food - which is pretty good - instead of getting the cheaply priced and completely delicious dumplings. One order of the amazing dumplings is a few bucks and should mostly fill you up. Even when leaving stuffed I'll keep thinking how good the dumpling broth is and the tactile joy of gently biting a small slit in the skin to suck it out. Sounds obscene, but the best food experiences are.

The service is bare-bones. You pretty much have to grab a server by the fanny to get them to notice you. But the fast pace is kind of fun, as is the Russian Roulette of being seated next to whoever happened to be at the same open table.",1
"When I tell you...THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT...and I hate waiting. During our visit to New York, I heard so many great things about Joe's Shanghai. I didn't think to believe the hype, but there was a crowd waiting outside. We waited nearly an hour for our table. 

When we were finally called, we had to share a table with two other people which wasn't preferred to me but it's New York, and the place was packed. However, we were served pretty quick. 

Now the dumplings. I've never had a soup dumpling before..and I'll never find another dumpling as good. I'm not being dramatic, I came back home to find soup dumplings but nothing compared. I dream of them (again not being dramatic.) The dumplings come fresh, they are nice and large and have the most flavorful broth. I ordered the pork and crab meat...yes.",1
"This is a mouthgasm waiting to happen!! Warning: there may be a line and the wait is not pretty (like any other popular NYC restaurant). 

I came in the dead of winter and was forced to wait 45 minutes for a table but lo and behold it was completely worth it! They seat you family style - for those of you who don't know it's usually a large circular table with other patrons. Your food is placed in front of you in a rotating circular section in the center of the table.

The soup dumplings are to die for, however for those who don't eat pork be forewarned that none of their soup dumplings are pork free. Also get the salt & pepper shrimp. For how much it costs, they give you quite a bit of shrimp and it is pretty darn authentic. YUMMM!!

This is a place you come if you want good (and cheap) food but don't be surprised if the decor isn't stellar or if there is a wait.",1
"I've tried soup dumplings in HK (din Tai Fung) , LA(din Tai Fung, Mama Lu)  and NYC (Joe's Shanghai), and Joe's Shanghai is ALWAYS my no. 1. 

Must order the crab soup dumplings if you only order one, it's so flavorful and you can taste the crab essence. For the regular pork one, it better than Don Tai Fung but not as great as MaMa Lu. But Joe's keep it authentic by steaming their soup dumplings on cabbage. 

One thing I also want to mention is that the size of dumplings def grew a size or two over the years. Which is great for holding the soup in the dumplings!",1
"It has been over 10 years since I last wrote about Joe's Shanghai. Everything that I've said about Joe's Shanghai's food back then is still true now. The dumpling quality is still one of the best in New York due to the thin chewy skin, dense broth and well-seasoned pork. They're also one of the last restaurants to serve 8 soup dumpling in a basket. Most other restaurants serve only 6. 

Joe's, for those of you who are new to this restaurant, has been around since the mid-1990's when it was one of the first soup dumpling restaurants in New York City. I still think they make the best version of soup dumplings in New York City. What has changed recently is that Joe's has moved into the old 27 Sunshine space at 46 Bowery. This was a great move because diners now have a larger, brighter and more modern space to eat. I recently visited and noticed that since the space is larger, there's a lesser likelihood of table-sharing as with the old space at Pell Street. The service was also the same: quick and efficient. When the bill came, there was the same 15 percent tip, which is automatically added to the receipt. This is understandable because of the large number of tourists who come to this location. Joe's is still cash only. There's two ATM machines in the vestibule of Joe's if cash is needed.

I ordered a beef fried rice cake and an order of pork soup dumplings. Both were just as good as in the old location. I looked at the other tables and noticed that the food looked the same, with only the plates and utensils upgraded. 

It was nice to see the food remain true to Joe's long history. I look forward to trying some of the more Shanghainese dishes on the menu in a later visit.",1
"There's always a huge line here with people waiting outside. The wait time could be anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hour. The soup dumplings are so worth it though! Out of the 5 times I've been here, there was only one time that the soup dumplings weren't that great.",1
"Two words:  SOUP DUMPLINGS!

Have you ever had dumplings with soup inside of it?! No? You my friend have not lived. 

Genius....Fucking Genius.",1
"The house special fried rice, eggplant, fried pork chop, beef brocolli, green beans, sesame chicken, general tso was all delicious.  Everyone from our party of 13 enjoyed all the dishes.  DELICIOUS!",1
The soup dumplings are a must try here!!! Dumplings are very big so definitely can share 1 order with another person. The soup inside was very good and it complimented the meat well.,1
"Love this place!
This place makes food that makes my mouth water all up!",1
"Some of the best dim sum I've ever had we got the steamed veg, scallion pancakes and the cold sesame noodles and it all tasted so fresh",1
"The best pork/crab soup dumplings... period.  If you haven't tried it, you haven't lived.  Its that simple.",1
Maybe I overhyped it in my head. Very good and def. worth doing at least once.,1
"I first came here four years ago while I was on vacation, and I had to go back when I was back in NYC. And boy I was not disappointed! I split an order of the pork xiao long bao (XLB) and the crab XLB with a friend. So we each devoured 8 XLBs. We loved it so much that we came twice during our trip. The wait is definitely worth it because those little (acutally it's ginormous compared to other places) dumplings make you so happy!  When the flavors from the warm soup inside the juicy XLBs explode in your mouth, you'll want to keep eating and eating. We tried some other dishes, which were pretty much forgettable. I would recommend sticking to the XLBs. Of course these are not as great as the real deal in Shanghai, but it's the best that I've tasted in the states.",1
"I will always come to this restaurant when I go to New York. 
The soup dumplings and pan fried noodles is a Must Have. The pan fried dumplings is good too! 

I found out recently they relocated to a bigger location. The inside looks very elegant and fancy now. 

*** CASH ONLY ***",1
"Joe's serves the plumpest, juiciest soup dumplings (xiao long bao) you'll probably ever have in your life. It wasn't too difficult to get a table for two here on Saturday around noon; we actually walked in and were seated immediately at a table to ourselves. Got really lucky! Seeing some larger groups waiting outside made us a little apprehensive about the wait time, but it ended up being only 30 seconds. Since the staff knows that most patrons are here for the soup dumplings, our waiter quickly asked how many orders of them we wanted so that we wouldn't have too long for the kitchen to steam them. We then ordered a scallion pancake and string beans when he came back later to our table. 

Like many other Chinese restaurants, the food comes out shortly after ordering, which is perfect for hangry and impatient people like me. The scallion pancake was super greasy and the string beans were good, but the headliner of the meal was for sure the pork soup dumplings. Eating and savoring them is an experience everyone should have. They were literally bursting with flavor! I've had xiao long bao at Din Tai Fung in China, and I must say the ones at Joe's were very comparable. 

Note: 15% tip is automatically applied to your check, no matter your party size",1
"I don't usually like Chinese food but these dumplings are a must have! Come early and be ready to take your number and wait in line outside- they do not take reservations. It is hidden on Pell street in Chinatown but the food is great and certainly stands out. Also recommend the duck, was delicious.",1
"The dumplings were amazing!!! Definitely worth making the trip to China town for them. We had the crab and beef mix dumplings. We had a chicken dish, spicy shrimp, and a crispy fried beef dish which was out favorite. The place was full of people so we knew we were in a good place. The service was quick and food yummy!!",1
We got seated fairly quickly! The soup dumplings were delicious and perfectly sized. The broth inside was had so much flavor and perfectly rationed with the dumpling itself. The crispy noodles were pretty good but it could have been crispier.,1
"Best soup dumplings in china town！ Just had lunch there, have to say it was the best soup dumplings i have ever had. if you looking to try some soup dumplings in china town this is the place you want go.",1
Best soup dumplings (their specialty) in Chinatown hands down!! Pork shoulder also very good. Scallion pancakes were better a few months ago not sure what changed. Be aware tip included on ALL checks since its a tourist spot.,1
"On vacation during the New Years holiday in New York we decided to stop here without knowing much about the place.  First off anyone who knows anything about New York is seating can be limited so definitely want to come real early 11:00am or real late.  Also driving is a nightmare you will want to take the bus or subway, parking in the city can $25 and up with no in and out privileges.  Parking garages that go for 9 an hour fill up real fast and driving to get to them is a nightmare.

So as seating was limited even at noon we were lucky to share a table with two other couples, this is very common in Hong Kong and I am sure Chinatown, NY.  The item that everyone in the restaurant orders is the Shanghai crab/pork soup dumplings, for 8 you pay 6.95 and they are very filling.  Inside is a very hot soup broth that is wonderful would not surprise me if they used duck broth instead of chicken broth.  Just be careful as juices can fly all over the place when you eat these dumplings.  The other dish we tried was jalapeno diced tofo and pork this was very good as well.  The interesting the I noticed about chinatown restaurants in New York rice never comes with the meal you usually have to pay a buck or two extra.  The other negative and this goes for most chinatown restaurants the bathrooms are horrible, but if you have to go better do it bathrooms are hard to find in the city!!!",1
"You have to wait approximately an hour before you are seated. Once you are seated, they will bring you water and ask if you want to order the xiao long bao first. Don't be surprised if they seat you next to strangers and spill water on you. Also you may not really hear what your friends are saying because it's extremely loud there. The pork and crab xiao long bao are really yummy. It has more soup than other restaurants that serves xiao long bao, but the meat is smaller. The scallion pancake is really good and wasn't that oily. The duck was really flavorful and delicious. However the vegetable wasn't that good. Overall, if you are willing to wait an hour and want xiao long bao with more soup, then you should come here. But, if you are in a rush and rather have more meat in your dumpings, then this place isn't the place to go.",1
"First time in New York and my friends brought me to the best Chinese food in town. The soup dumpling was redonculously good, chicken cucumber dish different but very tasty. Portions are totally sharing.  We got lucky and walked right in to a table. I can't wait to eat here again",1
"I found this place on yelp and it looked like the best place for soup dumplings in NYC. I'm sure everyone else has said this, but it's crowded and the wait on a winter's day (when we visited) was difficult. We were seating with some random folks, which made me feel oddly at home. The dumplings were juicy and piping hot. We ordered another dish that I can't remember, but it wasn't really worth mentioning. The dumplings are their specialty anyway. Out here on the west coast, I'm pretty much addicted to Din Tai Fung and you can't compare the two because they are different styles. I'll be back to Joe's the next time I'm in NYC.",1
"What can I say...a tourist hot spot, and normally I would be annoyed at the long waits,  and half-clueless patrons tearing away the soup dumplings with their forks, GAH!!! However, I love these soup dumplings here so much that nothing comes close. I'll agree to sit at the round table with other dumplovers and put up with the chaotic customer service and loud atmosphere just so I can indulge in some fabulous, soup-filled masterpieces.

Go, experience it. YOU MUST. These are not regular dumplings folks, these are not some pot stickers you throw on the stove..",1
This place is the bomb. Even on a rainy Sunday night we had to wait 15 minutes. Family style tables were fun though a bit cramped. The food was great. Soup dumplings are a must. Green beans were lovely. Wasn't a big fan of the sesame chicken...too sweet. Can't wait to go back!,1
"AMAZING SOUP DUMPLINGS! otherwise known as 小龙包 . Get the crab one. Super cheap and sooo amazing. Full of crab flavor!!! Much better than the overrated Din Tai Fung. And even arguably better than the crab specialty 小笼包 I've had in shanghai and I've had many soup dumplings (Btw obvi shanghai is in the title and it's The city  known for this dish). so I feel like I have a pretty decent tastes in regards to this. I'm here to say this is One of the BEST. All caps cause its that good!

Just TRY it. ITS THE EPITOME OF CRAB XIAO LONG BAO taste. and super cheap",1
"I have to admit I have never eaten soup dumplings anywhere else in the world so I have no basis of comparison.  I've been to all the Chinese hot spots in North America and maybe I was not paying attention at those times, but I've never had the shanghai soup dumplings until I went to Joe's a few years ago.  However, I have eaten many dumplings and Joe's version is so much better than what I'm usually accustomed to.  

Regardless of my lack of basis of comparison, these dumplings are very good.  Are they the best in NY or in the US?  I don't know but if someone is going to say they've had better, they better identify that establishment who makes the same dumplings. Trust me, I will try to seek out those establishments to see if you're right or just full of it.

I believe some of the bad reviews are from people who order other items beside the dumplings.  If a place is known for their soup dumplings, it's usually not fair to order the fish in soy sauce and then complain the entire place sucks, which is what some of the reviewers have done. 

What is clear is that it is almost undisputed by most of the reviews that the dumplings are unique and exceptional.  Some haters call this place a tourist trap.  A tourist trap is when only tourist goes to a place, when they could be going to a better place where the locals visit. As far as I can tell from reading the reviews, there aren't many places, even in NYC, that sells soup dumplings.    The characterization is unfair, especially in light of us going to eat at this place with some NY locals, recently, who have lived and worked in Chinatown for over 15 years.  They all agreed the soup dumplings are fantastic and an ""attraction"" to the NY area and they routinely bring their guests to this restaurant.

If you want to order something else at Joe's, the braised pork shoulder is exceptional, if you don't mind the fat.  Yes, it's greasy and fattening but it's also damn good. .  

It's ironic how some of the reviewers complain about the greasiness of the food but don't do the same when they eat bacon.  When you eat pork, there is a high percentage that your meal will be greasy.  The dumplings are pork and the braised pork shoulder is pork.  You're not eating chicken breast. Get a clue and don't waste our time posting your complaint that the food is greasy.",1
"First time to Joe's, always known they are famous with their soup dumpling. 2 minutes we sat down, waiter came to ask if we want to order the soup dumpling? we picked the crab pork to start. We should've ordered the pork soup dumpling, because it will come faster, we waited the crab pork one for over 15 minutes.

Their soup dumpling is verrry good, not only it is tasty and flavorful, its big and have more soup. The dumpling wrapper doesnt break easily like other (3++, i hate to lose the soup). we also ordered 2 other dishes. Its good, it is not salty at all. The noodle we order is spicy enough, the heat is just right. The hot sauce on the table, have no other flavour only heat but surprisely it is a good match with the soup dumpling.",1
"Everyone comes here for the dumplings, but I was impressed by their other dishes. That's not to say the xialongbao (aka ""soup dumplings"") weren't fantastic (they were), but I was really blown away by everything on the table.

Surprisingly, the pea shoots were the highlight of the evening. Juicy, savory, enormous portions. A standout. The scallion pancake was also scrumptious, especially with the dipping sauces. The sweet and sour jumbo shrimp's were plump perfection. And the crab soup dumplings were heaven. A+ meal. Would come here again in a heartbeat.

The wait times weren't bad, although it was PACKED on a Wednesday night. I can't imagine what it looks like on a Friday or Saturday evening. Not sure if they take reservations, but they have ample room and large tables for groups.

Definitely show up with a thick wallet, because this place is CASH ONLY. Not to fear, there is a Bank of America around the corner.

So far my favorite Chinese restaurant in NY. Impressive.",1
"Why Come Here? Sample Northern Chinese Cuisine, Great Soup Dumplings, Cheap Eats

Joe's Shanghai is the epitome of what one envisions in a New York Chinatown restaurant. Hectic, cash-only service. Pots of tea on communal tables. A large menu containing numerous dishes you've never heard of. It's almost too perfect in these regards, which actually ends up giving it an aura of in-authenticity. But that's okay. It provides great Shanghainese (and other types as well) food in a setting that's far more approachable to many New Yorkers than the divier places nearby or out in Flushing. Here's what we ate:

Crab & Pork Steamed Buns - Joe's is known for these and with good reason. The broth inside is out of this world good.

String Bean Szechuan Style - Lightly fried green beans with a little bit of spice. They're a nice veggie option, but not terribly exciting.

Beef with Broccoli - Thin pieces of beef, crispy on the outside and tender within covered in a tangy orange glaze. Addictive stuff.

Shanghai Fried Flat Noodle - Tasty noodles with a good helping of pork and veggies.",1
"Ordered crab and pork soup dumplings, vegetable dumplings, scallion pancakes, and spicy calamari. I have to say that Is agree with the reviewers the crab and pork dumplings were my favorite- flavorful and done very well. I haven't had vegetable dumplings like this but I liked it. The calamari was fresh and crisp. I was a bit disappointed with the scallion pancakes though. It just didn't rack up with other places I have had scallion pancakes. Not as crisp, not as flavorful, and not as chewy.",1
"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in New York. Food is great. It's worth the wait and yes, you might be waiting. You might sit next to some complete strangers depending on how many people are in your group, but despite that...it's still worth it. 

Order the soup dumplings and the scallion pancakes...very good! I wish I could remember everything I've ordered from here, but I don't. I just remember it all being very good. 

Honestly, it's been over 2 years since I last went here and I still remember being really satisfied after eating here. My mouth waters even remembering this place. Even my cousin who doesn't even like Chinese food really liked the food. Everyone that comes with me to eat here also loves it. 

I would give this place 5 stars but they need to make this place bigger to meet the long wait and demand. If you're in Chinatown...check it out.",1
"With over 3K reviews, I'm pretty sure they don't need my 5stars but this place is my favorite place in the city. Anytime I have visitors, I bring them here for soup dumplings. We've tried other things like: pan friend noodles, bakchoy, general tsos, scallion pancakes, lo mein, fried rice, and many other dishes. I've been extremely happy with everything I've eaten there. LOVE me some Joe's!",1
"Pork Soup Dumplings. They were so uh-maze-balls. And the pork jalapeno dish along with their regular dumplings were also superb. Ugh I'm getting hungry now. Just try those, you wont be disappointed.",1
"THE best soup dumplings EVER. I moved from NYC 3 years and every time I go back I have to stop by Joe's Shanghai and get (2) orders of the soup dumplings - one of the Crab Meat and one of the Pork - and the Pan Fried Crispy Noodles with veggies. Always consistent, always delicious. The soup dumpling's broth is perfection, packed with all the flavors you want. It never disappoints. A must if you're in NYC!!!",1
"Okay, I love this place so much.  They have the best Juicy dumplings and Sesame chicken.  The other place that is just as good would be New Green Bo.  They are both amazing.",1
"I love coming to Joe's Shanghai (try to come earlier so you won't have to wait as long).

The soup dumplings are fantastic and cheap for the amount you can get per order, which is one of the best things about Joe's. They aren't on the menu that they give you when you sit down, but the waiter typically asks you if you want them. 

The pan fried noodles and sweet and sour pork are both very tasty and authentic. The pork was especially tender. 

Only recently did I notice that it seems to be a trend in popular restaurants in Chinatown to sit you at a large table with strangers if your own party is small. Sometimes it can be awkward, but usually people don't mind.",1
"The pork soup dumplings were SO good! We also got the crabmeat dumplings and Shanghai noodle soup. I really liked the Shanghai noodle soup when the chili oil was added, but it was kind of bland. I would rather get another pork dumplings instead of crabmeat dumplings.",1
"This classic soup dumpling spot will always have a special place in my heart. Everything here is amazing. From the pork and crab meat soup dumplings to the chicken pan friend noodles. 

Make sure to bring your cash!",1
"Came here hoping to get lunch but the wait was extremely long. We opted to get takeout and eat it outside instead. It took us 10 minutes to take our order because service is nonexistent at good Chinese mom and pop places. We ordered takeout and it took 30 minutes to get our XLB.

Crab meat and pork XLB - very flavorful. You can taste the crab in this. The skin is super thin and explodes with soup once you bite into it.

Pork XLB - very flavorful. A solid pork xiao long bao.",1
"Their soup dumplings were fabulous - there was a bit of a wait but definitely well worth it!  Btw - I couldn't stop taking pictures of the huge goldfish in the front - see pictures.

Service was alright but the food was really good - the soup dumplings, I can't stop talking about how good they were.  The xiao long bao is just really yummy!  Everything was just so good there - even from the string beans to the Chinese broccoli and egg drop soup and the pepper salt porkchops - yum!",1
"Sorry Yank Sing in SF and Sorry Ding Tai Fung but I've converted.  OMG, I am sooo happy to finally give a 5 star to a restaurant!  With limited time in New York and limited room in our stomachs we still managed to come here twice because it was just that darn good!

I travel around the world just to eat siu long bao (soup dumplings), been to the original Ding Tai Fung in Taiwan, tried 20+ siu long bao places in Shanghai, had it in SF, had it in Hong Kong, had it in LA and Joe's basically killed all competition.  I think I went into a trance when I had my first bite, the soup and flavors bursts inside my mouth tantalizing all my taste buds.  The meat consistency was perfect, not too fatty not too dense. The ones at Ding Tai Fung almost taste like powder compared to this yet this is also fluffy enough of a meat filling that it's not tough.  The soup is not too fatty, after eating 3 trays of it (24 dumplings - yes I eat a LOT) I wasn't greased out like I was at Yank Sing in SF.  The Crab dumping is the best, actually tastes like the crab roe unlike some places where the crab and pork ones basically taste the same.  The skin is perfectly thin like Ding Tai Fung and doesn't fall apart easily so holds the soup very well.  Finally the soup flavor is just insanely tasty - It's just Siu long bao perfection!",1
"Heard all about this place for the longest time, and i finally got to try this myself. It definitely lives up to the hype, not like any other shao long bow I've tried. Filled with so much flavorful broth, the meat itself was so tender and delicious. It's definitely a little gem and somethjng you must try when visiting NY.",1
Our nephew lives in NY and recommended this place it was sooo good! From their famous pork dumplings and their sesame chicken and their rice it's all great! I would highly recommend it!,1
Yummy soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai. We ordered two regular pork and two crab soup dumplings. All were perfectly cooked and so tasty. The place was packed you should always be prepared to sit with strangers. The service was spotty but it didn't matter everything you need is brought to you as soon as you sit. This restaurant only accepts cash so be prepared to bring some.,1
"Arrived at 1:30pm on a Saturday, got seated for 5 people by 2pm. Places was crowded but we were well taken care of, the complimentary tea was nice! Had to order the soup dumplings and they did not disappoint. Ordered the fried rice and sesame beef as well but had to change them to to-go orders because the dumplings were so filling! Definitely a place to check out if you have the chance.",1
"the only positive thing i have to say about this place, is the same thing everyone else says.... HOLY SOUP DUMPLINGS.

oh also, there pan fried noodles with chicken. excellent. 

service sucks, but lets be real; this isn't jean gorges.",1
first timer in chinatown and had someone recommend this must go to restaurant. fell in love with the hole in the wall vibe. we (party of nine) were seated very quickly and had our food come fast too. the soup dumplings are TO DIE FOR. literally the best thing to get.,1
Yeeeeeeees had these soup dumplings a year ago and I still salivate when I think about them. The dumplings so juicy that I accidentally sprayed my friends across the table when I bit down on one. Definitely will come back next time I'm back in New York!,1
"This is my second visit. I brought my friend here with me, and he likes it too. i would come back again and again. I've had better soup dumplings before but Joe's does not disappoint. Scallion pancakes are a must too.",1
"Got off the plane, checked into the hotel and ran down here.  This is my second time here and we wanted to kick off our NYC eating extravaganza with a bang.  As soon as you sit down they immediately ask you if you want XLB because that is what every one is here for.  Don't worry they come back for the rest of your order later.  Other dishes are good, but I could eat my body weight in XLB.  Cash only at this location.",1
I LOVE their pork soup dumplings. A must experience for all the friends who come to visit me in the city. Also try the Sesame Chicken and the scallion pancake. Service is only OK but the food is worth it.,1
"i swear i come here at least once a month. i have my birthday here every year (is that sad??) 
this location is now my favorite joe's shanghai location, followed by the flushing location.

my favorites on the menu
- scallion pancakes
- pork soup dumplings
- stir fried string beans
- eggplant w garlic sauce
- shanghai styled noodles with beef
- stir fried rice cakes with chicken
- chicken fried rice 

if u want to get a lil turnt, they sell bottles of chinese beer here too. 
cash only, service charge is 15% and included in the bill (some people tip extra not knowing its already included). 
avoid this place on weekends from 6-9pm, wait can be up to an hour and a half. 

some will argue that this place is a tourist trap - i mean, it is, but food is awesome. i'd eat here every night if i were on some sort of strange high carb diet.",1
"I wasn't very big on Shanghai food, but then this place was pretty delicious. My first time coming here was with my parents and grandmother. My mom had been recommended this place by someone at her work place. The place is pretty crowded because a lot of tourists and people around has heard about their delicious soup buns. It was pretty yummy, but there really is always a handful amount of people here.
Another time I had went with a friend. We ordered some noodles. My friend enjoyed her dish, but I must say that my dish of noodles was another story... Not the best, but otherwise, their regular Shanghai stuff is good!",1
"Best. Xialongbao. Ever. 

Yum!!  Their XLB are hot and juicy and delicious!!  I wish they had one in CA!  It beats Din Tai Fung hands down.

We've also ordered their fried rice and string beans, which was good, but the portion is a little small.  I only came here for the soup dumplings.  Yum.

The only weird thing when I first came here was to sit with some random strangers at the same table.  But it's a New York experience, I hear.  :)

It can be touristy and a long long wait.  Go early!  Afterwards, you can have dessert a couple doors down at Chinatown ice cream factory.",1
"One of my favorite places for soup dumplings in NYC! There is almost always a wait and it's cash only but it is worth it. You can get a lot of food for a small amount of cash. The regular dumplings, fried rice and scallion pancakes can't be missed!",1
"Great food and service! We had amazing soup dumplings, crispy beef and kung pau chicken. Ambiance was clean but no frills. You are there to eat!",1
Best soup dumpling ( Shao Long Poo)  shop in the NYC. Don't expect other food here as others are not that good comparing soup dumpling. But I came back this restaurant many times and I will.,1
"Came here by myself (party of 1 is always slightly embarrassing, but I'm not ashamed) on Saturday night at 7:30 and there was a line out the door. I waited about 30 minutes and then was seated at a table with 10 other people. I ordered one order of the crab soup dumplings and one of the pork soup dumplings. They come in eights. Yes, I sat down, I ate 16 soup dumplings myself, paid (cash only) and left.

I liked the crab ones better than the pork ones. The pork ones tasted like a lot of other pork dumplings. And after my 16, my mouth felt kind of dry (even after downing two cups of water and two cups of tea). But for as hectic as it was in there, service was pretty attentive and quick.

Note: The crab dumplings were $8-something and pork were $6-something, and they automatically tack on a 15% service charge (yes even for a party of 1), so after tax it came out to about $18 total.",1
"The dumplings themselves are pretty good.. and I crave them occasionally, but I'd give Joe's Shanghai 5 STAR for the experience. I'd like to say a group of us are regulars here, we've visited both locations (Flushing and Manhattan Chinatown) and we can't really complain about the food; for Chinese food, it's not too greasy or oily - doesn't leave you feeling super guilty after the meal. 

The dumplings themselves are always excellent; I prefer the pork over the crab ones, the crab ones are a little too ""fishy"" for me. I think the experience of eating these soup dumplings itself is what I always rave about. Most people when they think about soup and dumplings, traditionally,  they think about the dumplings being submerged into a bowl of broth like in most Asian cuisines, however you're in for a surprise if you haven't tried these before at Joe's Shanghai. You have to find out and experience them yourself. Don't forget to put enough of the vinegar/soy sauce concoction!",1
"delicious! great quality, fast service and affordable meal prices.

after a long tiring day of walking on canal street and listening to the same phrase ""you want omega, rolex, i have here"" a billion times, joes shanghai is a great place to sit down and enjoy and good quality meal. I highly recommend this place for a great chinese dish and dumplings. I must say the dumplings are amazing!

only downfall is, it is a new york style eatery, in sense that they want you in and out. its good for new yorkers, however me, i like to sit and take my time, not have my check on the table before I havent even finished my meal.",1
"The soup dumplings are delicious! I have yet to find better soup dumplings ever! I have been to this location more than once. I also tried the scallion pancakes which were very good as well as a special entrée with prawns. Make sure to bring cash! Also, if you can't find street parking, the parking garages nearby are very expensive so make sure you are on foot when visiting.",1
"Certainly the best soup dumplings you'll find in NYC. Ding Tai Fung and you know, places in actual Shanghai might be better but this place is pretty classic. Came here on a Sun night with 7 old friends - mostly Caucasians, mind you - and they loved it. The wait wasn't too bad once we were all present (maybe 15 min?) and because we were a good-sized group, we got a table against the wall to ourselves (yes folk, you should except to share tables if you have less than 4 in your party - true Chinatown experience).

We ordered 4 palates of the soup dumplings (3 pork, 1 crabmeat - I think it was a general consensus that we all liked the pork better), cold sesame noodles, scallion pancakes, Shanghai noodles, ""kong xin zai"" (green ""hollow"" Chinese veggie), eel with yellow chives (in a brown sauce), and Peking chicken. The soup dumplings and noodle dishes were excellent, but the scallion pancakes were too greasy (my white friends liked it but I've had better) and I found a couple of weird bones in the eel, which was also a little salty to eat by itself (perfect with rice). The total bill came out to be $106 including gratuity - $15/person, with drinks. The restaurant was loud, animated, and a little crazy like a good Chinese restaurant should be, but it was all background noise and didn't interfere with our conversation. The servers were also pretty accommodating with large groups (and adding seats halfway) and helpful with menu choices.",1
Absolutely Delicious !! Our 9 year son loved it! He wanted to try some good old authentic dumplings and after doing some research this had the greatest reviews so we decided to check it out.,1
"Was it worth the 20 minute wait? HELL YES. 

As a visitor from San Francisco, known for its Chinese food, I was pleased to find this jewel. Awesome assortment of Shanghai-nese dumplings, thick noodles, and garlic veggies. Joe's Shanghai is perfect for cold or warm weather. What a unique and special place to eat!",1
"I've had soup dumplings in Shanghai and these are just as good! 

When we first came here, I was a bit deterred by a few things. First, THIS is the location to go to (as opposed to the midtown one) but it's located in Chinatown and the street is a bit deserted. You will, however, see a crowd of people clutching tickets and looking hopefully toward the door. Who are they looking for? The person in charge of the waiting list, of course! She yells your number out, tells you to wait by the door, ensures that your party is all here, and then finally tells you to wait in side. SECOND, unless you have a big party and get really lucky, you will probably share a table with another group. Get over it. The couple that was finishing up their meal across from us were really nice, but the second group of people...not so much. 

Order the crab and pork dumplings when you get there, and maybe scallion pancakes as an appetizer. I haven't had the other food..why would I waste precious stomach space on something other than dumplings? I've heard the pork-only dumplings are really good as well. 

When they bring out the dumplings steamed on cabbage leaves, get ready. Use the tongs to gingerly pick up the top of the dumpling (be careful not to break the exterior or the soup spills out!) and admire how the bottom of the dumpling droops a bit, JUST LIKE IT SHOULD. Place it on your soup spoon, pour some of the black vinegar/ginger/soy sauce on top, and bite a small hole into the skin of the dumpling. The rich and delicious broth will stream out onto your spoon so carefully drink this and then enjoy the rest of the dumpling. Heaven in my mouth. 

Cash only, and I think gratuity is included (but we added another tip anyway).",1
6600 reviews can't be wrong. What an awesome experience and delicious dinner! Highly recommend anytime you're in the Chinatown area. Just remember... Cash only!,1
"Awesome food! We've loved everything we've eaten here. However, be prepared for crowds and long waits. 

Hopefully someday they'll expand!

Also, remember to bring cash.",1
"This place is always extremely crowded, but the wait is well worth it. Best spot in Chinatown! The soup dumplings are to die for. I have been coming here for over 10 years and will continue to come back. Only place I go when I am in the area. My family and I always bring out of towners here to give them the real Chinatown experience. They do seat strangers at the same table, so if you do have a small party you should expect that.",1
This place always has a wait and there is no wonder why... these are the absolute best pork dumplings I have ever tasted. The way the broth melts in your mouth and the way there just jam packed with flavor is incredible. Try to come on a weekday to beat the lines,1
"Yes yes yes yes the answer is yes. You cannot visit NY without trying Joe's Shanghai! Or if you live here go more often. The Xiao long bao is bigger than most its certainly not bite sized. Dough was also a little thicker but I liked that since there's more soup in this dumpling than most. 

When we came there was a line out the door with a 40+ min wait. We just took them to go and ate it standing up on the street. Not the best in terms of experience, but better than waiting. You can't pass these up! Ugh craving them now as I write this.",1
"One of my go-to spots for ordering in Chinese food. Can't go wrong with their fried rice & moo shoo dishes! Also their scallion pancakes are delicious too. However, I've found their dumplings and spring rolls a little inconsistent (occasionally overly greasy / lacking flavor, most time pretty good tho).",1
"Overall rating: THE BEST XIU LONG BAO IN NYC. 

Food: This is perhaps my favorite restaurant in Manhattan's Chinatown. I first came here when I was 12 and the xiu long bao (soup dumplings) were amazing. Even today, they are equally amazing. The ""skin"" is not too thick or thin. They don't stick to your teeth and they're a little chewy. The meat is very bitey (which is a great thing because it's not loose and mushy)and juicy. The crab meat ones have a good seafood taste and the normal pork ones have a great meaty taste-- not smelly. The soup was a nice consistency and rich with flavors that complimented the meat. We also had the fried dumplings, which were also delicious! It's a little greasy, as expected, because it's fried, but it's so good. so good. if you like dumplings, you'll like it. The skin is one of the most important parts and it's similar to the ones used in the xiu long bao, meaning it's good. Also, if you come here, you should save most of the room in your stomach for the xiu long bao. If you wanted an actual Chinese dinner, the food is about the same as the next top rated Chinese restaurant, probably with a shorter wait. 

Cost: My boyfriend and I ordered one crab meat xiu long bao, one pork, and one fried dumplings. The total was about $30 with tip and everything. 

Atmosphere/Appearance: The place was small and there are as many tables that can fit as possible. They are mainly large tables, so smaller parties will probably end up sharing a table. If that makes you uncomfortable, it's ok it's part of the experience. I actually liked the hustle and bustle and how cozy it was. 

Service: There are usually many employees working. Again, being in Chinatown, it definitely helps if you spoke Cantonese or Mandarin. If you don't know how to speak these languages, you can always learn a few phrases and give yourself a pat on the back. It'll be well worth it for the food alone. The servers were also very quick to ask if we wanted to place an order for xiu long bao so they can get started right away, which was absolutely brilliant.",1
"Only came here to try the xiao long bao and it was certainly quite the experience! The gf and I came before the lunch rush and was able to get seated at a shared table (two gentlemen sat across from us). We were not too hungry and only wanted to share an entree and decided to go with the XLB as it is highly rated on yelp. We also received complimentary tea and about 10 minutes after ordering received our freshly steamed XLB. The skin is not as thin as Din Tai Fung but it certainly helped hold all the dumpling juice inside. There was so much soup that the XLB would droop down from the weight! The meat was tasty enough as well and for about $10 I definitely felt it was worth the price. 

Overall, the service was quick and I was fortunate that the staff didn't give me a hard time for only sharing one entree or requiring a minimum per person. Highly recommend visiting this restaurant and would definitely consider ordering more if I had a larger group!",1
Very good soup dumplings! I initially walked by and didn't have cash on me (restaurant is cash only for dine in) but I was able to place an order through yelp and pay with a credit card. It's right next to the Manhattan bridge so it was a nice view to eat outside anyway.,1
"Came here about 12 on a Saturday and there was a 20 min wait for 2 people. I had read ahead about the place so was satisfied and happy. 

Things you should know:
There will be a wait
You will be sat at a table with others
Service is fast and somewhat rushed to get everyone in 
15% gratuity already added to bill
the pork soup dumplings are awesome and you need to order them as soon as you sit
You get hot tea with your order

I also liked the scallion pancakes however not the best I've ever had they were quite good. Shanghai noodles were also very good but oily in a good taste way but bad for your stomach later ! These things are reasonable priced. Not sure why chicken dishes are so pricey here but we didn't get them. 

For the soup dumplings. I thought there was a decent amount of pork and that delicious broth. The crab ones I heard are a bit fishy so I stayed away.  

We had  an extra item on our bill that we had to ask them to remove so check your bill !",1
"Typical yummy soup dumplings. Always crowded. Most of the time you need to wait. Food will be worth it though. However, there are so many other great Shanghainese restaurants around Chinatown that this place is pretty much a tourist trap.",1
"SO HAPPY we got the chance to try this place out. The first time we came to New York, we heard the wait for this place is ridiculous so we avoided it at all costs. This time around, we decided to give it a shot since we were in the area. We lucked out because we were seated in 10 minutes, tops. We were seated at a large round family table. Confused at first, since others were already seated, we realized they sit as many parties as they can at each table. Efficient.

Also to my surprise, Joes isn't a dumpling house. I expected the menu to be a variety of dumplings/dim sum but instead it was a typical Chinese restaurant menu: fried rice, chow mien, beef, etc. What you're looking for and what they're most famous for is an appetizer. Crab meat with pork meat steamed buns.

Now, you would think we knew how to eat the buns correctly since we've had Din Tai Fung back home... But idk if we were just hungry and not thinking straight but we both bit right into it and it was a huge mess!! LOL so my friends, make sure you bite the top off first, let it cool down a bit then add your soy sauce and/or hot sauce into the dumpling and devour!

We also ordered the scallion pancakes which were a HIT! Be sure to try.

CASH ONLY!! Thank goodness there was an ATM nearby or else we would've been washing dishes to pay for our meals.",1
"Soup Dumplings (sometimes also called Juicy Buns) are the specialty here, and they are definitely very good. But don't stop there, because while they're known for their dumplings I was actually more impressed by their Braised Duck and their Shredded Eel with Yellow Scallions. The Soup Dumplings are good, but I think I actually prefer them at Liberty View in Battery Park. As a side note, the last time I went to Joe's Shanghai, I ended up sharing a table with Chad Lowe.",1
Their soup dumplings aren't bad. Not my go to for soup dumplings but I really like their Pan fried noodles here.,1
"Soup dumplings!!! The only reason why I came. I'm from Atlanta and I have not yet found a place with good soup dumplings. So I was determined to eat some while visiting NYC! First of all, it is a cash only place. So be sure to have that in hand. Second, the place is VERY crowded. Tables are close together and you will most likely being sharing a table with another group if you have a small party. The servers are very impatient. We literally just sat down and the gentleman was already trying to take our order and kept coming back like every 30 second. We wanted to view the menu since it was our first time. My friends and I didn't order much because we just wanted to snack. So we ordered soup dumplings, scallion pancake, and a pork dish. They were all very good!! Literally the best soup dumplings and scallion pancake I ever had! The soup dumpling was nice and hot with great flavors. The scallion pancake was crispy and tasty! The pork dish tasted generic, but good. Even though very crowded and busy, I wouldn't mind coming back to eat!

Another group sat at my table with me, so I only got to picture the soup dumpling.",1
"Had so much fun at Joe's Shanghai yesterday and it was definitely some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The soup dumplings are hard to eat, if you are a novice, but well worth the trouble. We also had the Moo Shoo pork, which I would highly recommend. We went on Sunday at 1 pm and only waited ten minutes for a table. Service was very attentive.",1
Got the crab and pork dumplings as an appetizer. Got 8 full sized ones. Yummy. Soup inside them with meat. Entrees we ordered were chicken with mushroom & bamboo and schezuan beef. Chicken with mushroom/bamboo was outstanding. Would come here again. Cash only.,1
"Yeah, okay, does Joe's really need another review?

Well I'm going to throw my SORTA ABC (American born Chinese, but not really) 2 cents in here:

1. Food here is not that spectacular, it's just good to me.  But duuuude it's cheap, tasty, service is fast (even if you wait some pretty minutes for a table), and the quality is consistent.  (I've been here quite a few times thanks to an obsessed fwend.)

It has a good, no fuss no muss atmosphere because it's teeming with people and hot steam from those lovely little soup dumplings, and nobody's going to look at you when you bit into a scalding dumpling and act a fool.  Speaking of which....

2. The soup dumpling is the draw of this place.  Hence, haven't tried much else.  Don't think anything else could be that spectacular.  Very common Asian fare.

Was that 2 cents....times a hundred bazillion? Show me the money!",1
"Excellent soup dumplings -- love how they explode in my mouth. My boyfriend recommends the vegetarian duck, a small yet really tasty appetizer.",1
"Excellent Shanghainese food. The soup dumplings, of course, are famous. The lion's head meatball was AMAZING and savory and the pork with bean curd skin was great as well. 

This place can get crowded, especially on weekends and holidays. Try coming on a weekday at 11 or 11:30 to avoid crowds.",1
"To be completely frank, I've had better soup dumplings and scallion pancakes (in China), but that's not exactly a fair comparison and this side of the big pond, Joe's Shanghai is pretty much as good as it gets. The waiting gets a little annoying though if you're a regular, simply because there aren't many peers in town.",1
"Best soup dumplings in NY.  The staff is a little rude, but that's expected in Chinatown.  A bit heavy handed on the MSG.  The automatically add 15% tip to the bill.  I'm just rating them based on the pork and crab dumplings.",1
"The best XIAO LONG LAO (soup dumplings) I've ever had, exceptionally flavorful and filling! 

I wish I had the chance to try other dishes on the menu,  but was too full from our multiple orders of the soup dumplings",1
ok the soup-filled pork dumplings - i don't know how they do it (actually i do - they freeze the broth then wrap them in the dumpling wrapper and when it steams - the broth thaws and stays inside the dough - clever indeed!) - but um um good! lol - quite an experience indeed. totally will go back - if i can ever find it again!,1
"It's taken 9 months but I've finally managed to patronize each of the restaurants in the Joe's Shanghai trifecta.  Be prepared for a wait of at least an hour and once seated, expect hurried wait service since seating is limited and they want to maximize turnover.  The stand out dish is of course the xiu long bao. While it's near perfect in construction and flavor, I still prefer the soup dumplings at nearby Shanghai Cafe.  I think the wrapper there is thinner and more delicate.  The meat tastes fattier too which is not a plus for most people but most certainly is for me.  

The other stand out dish for me is the fried mantou roll.  It's $1.25 and comes with five mini fried mantou and condensed milk. for dipping.  They're golden on the outside and the inside is still like a dense roll.  Drizzle sweet condensed milk on it and throw it down the hatch.  I can't think of a better breakfast/dessert item.",1
"Great xiaolongbao and dampling.
If you're tired of having American food,Go there and live your american life.Here absolutely won't regret you.",1
"known for their juicy dumplings. 
it's like din tai fung dumpling house in arcadia (on the west coast) except the dumplings are bigger, doughier and greasier and with more crab flavor.

i like it but it's too greasy so i can't eat a lot of them...",1
"I really enjoyed Joe's Shanghai. We got:

-Crab and pork soup dumplings
-Pork soup dumplings
-Fried rice cake
-Sautéed string beans
-Wine Chicken

The food was great, and probably some of the best soup dumplings I've had. Wine chicken was also very spot-on with the wine. Overall, great place to eat in Chinatown, but expect a long wait to get in.",1
"I only came here for soup dumplings, so that is what my rating is based on. 

Seriously, the soup dumplings were SOOO good!! I want to go back there again but I dread the crowdedness of the restaurant and it's extremely distracting environment. But it was totally worth it. To give a little background, I've had many a soup dumplings in Taiwan, which almost makes me snobby about soup dumplings and dumplings in general. But I like to think that I just strive for good quality, satisfying food. I honestly think Joe's Shanghai delivers, and I may change my mind when I go back again, but so far, 5 stars.",1
"This is our absolute Favorite when we go to NYC!!
During our last week in Ny this last thanksgiving holiday, we at here 3 times. I feel sorry for the other Shanghai restaurants in NYC as they will never get us as patrons as we are now lifelong Joe's fans!
Their XLB, the yummiest and bestest! Slurp!!
The crab ones are good too but if i had to choose, the pork ones are bombastic!
Thier steamed dumplings are ono too!
During our last visit we ordered the razor clams and they were so delicious, however we ran out of room from all the dumplings we had so we will have to sample them again next time we're in NY... not that we're complaining :) !
The wait is long yes, but it's worth it for perfection.
Cheap and Delicious! We love you Joes!",1
"This isn't overhyped. Not even a little. 

The Good: Soup dumplings have a ton of flavor. Cheap. And the waits are surprisingly short.

The Bad: You'll probably have to share a table. You'll feel rushed. The side dishes are really mediocre. But who comes here for the sides?",1
"This place is a MUST! Although this review is old because I went about 3-4 years ago I insist you try this place. Again, before my travels I start to research what locations have good tasting food based on reviews and this one had so many. It's literally some where in china town hole in the wall place , but worth it! Worth the wait and everything I came here for some pork soup buns I think called Xiao Bao best purchase in my life I can still remember the taste up until this day! Just amazing every thing was delicious. The ambiance is also interesting we waited for our turn to sit and we got sat with a group of other people that we did not even know in the same table which was interesting to me, but since the volume of people and their set up is big round table and or squared ones they seat you as it becomes available according to how many you have in your party. Anyways hands down would return I just loved it! Better than LA Chinese food.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is always a highly recommended restaurant, and it's pretty good. Their soup dumplings are delicious and really filling, so I'd actually recommend only ordering one or two other items. Their corn and chicken soup is so delicious! My boyfriend and I loved it and kept getting seconds and thirds. Joe's is a really authentic chain, and I highly recommend it if you ever have a craving for good Chinese food. Yes, it's pretty overhyped, but I don't think you'll be disappointed. Prices aren't bad, and service is decent even during busy hours too.",1
"Oh Joe's,

We've been going to Joe's for a very long time so I figured it was about damn time I wrote them a gleaming review. Call me a no-taste having basic plebian but I think Joe's Shanghai has the best tasting Xiao Long Baos (XLBs) anywhere this side of the Andromeda Galaxy. Better than Shanghai Manor, better than Ding Tai Fung (shoutout to the Taiwanese), better than Cheng Huang Miao (shoutout to the Shanghainese), and better than anywhere else you're going to suggest.

Heads up - wait is always 30min+. Might explain why the food always tastes so good. Others may dock it a star or two for the slow rotation but I don't blame em. 

Here's what we ordered:

10 Pork XLBs／猪肉小笼包: In a lot of remote places outside of the developed world you don't have all of the superfluous items that the rest of the world has, all you have are your basic necessities - the things that you need. If Joe's were that remote place, and you were that simple farmboy, then Pork soup dumplings would be that basic necessity. If this were all you ordered, then that would be A-ok. Thin skin, nectar of the gods (soup), and fragrant-ass pork. I have seen the face of heaven and it is served in a bamboo basket. 

Pro tip- bite the top off first to avoid work-related injuries.

10 Crab XLBs／蟹粉小笼包: Every light casts a shadow, and every yang must have a yin. So it is with pork and crab XLBs. Eat a pork then eat a crab, then eat another pork. It's the circle of life. The soup is a little stonger due to the aroma of the crab and almost resembles a light seafood broth/base. The filling leaves a tiny bit to be desired since sometimes the crab meat can be a little loose, but that's probably due to the excess water of the crab meat. 

Scallion Pancakes/葱油饼: Another go-to dish whenever we pay a visit to Joe's. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Pro tip- use the scallion pancake to mop up the leftover vinegar/soup spillover on your plate for guaranteed high-cholesterol and saturated fats.

Shanghai Thick Noodles/上海抄粗面: A slight variation to the usual take-out restaurant chow mein fanfare. I'm usually not a big fan of ordering this dish since I don't see what's so special and I'd rather save room for the XLBs. Not bad though, it's just a shame that it has to share a roof with dishes that are so much better. Kindof like how Stockton/Malone were great players that unfortunately had to play in the Jordan era. 

Ham and Pork Shank Soup/腌笃鲜: Growing up, one of my best friend's family was Shanghainese and they used to make this soup all the time. They'd make it so good that my parents would call in advance whenever we'd have dinner together to make sure they were making it; if they weren't, they'd offer to buy the requisite ingredients to make it. Joe's, while not as great as those made by the Li family (names changed to protect those involved), was not bad. The pork was tender and the soup was aromatic or 'xian' enough. The only thing lacking were the bamboo shoots. You could tell that they were from a can bought from HK Supermarket a few blocks down.

The wait might suck but Joe's is definitely worth the wait and the possible communal seating if they're packed. Hopefully you happen to sit across from a billionaire or your potential future wife/husband?",1
"I found Joe's through my fiancé who used to live in New York. I never really had the urge to ever visit New York, but I took the trip for her. As a side note I absolutely LOVE New York and Joe's due to this fact. She stated that there was a good restaurant in chinatown we should check out. I was not very adventurous at the time, but I thought why not I am on vacation. Good was an understatement my mind literally exploded with enjoyment inside my brain cavity when I tried their famous soup dumplings. When this  pork soup dumpling sat in front of me I was taken back with negative thoughts. It appeared to be a sack of meat wrapped in dough, but starving I put this oddity into my mouth. Immediately wonderful and magical things began to happen. This odd sack of meat immediately triggered explosions in my brain. If I was not in  fear of being arrested I would have jumped on top of this shared table to scream out to everyone how good this amazing pork soup dumpling made me feel inside my whole body. I wanted to raise my fork in the air(due to my inability to use chopsticks I know its shameful) and shout at the top of my lungs, ""soooooooooup Dumplings"". Instead I turned to my Fiancé and said quietly, ""wow these are amazing"", far from my intended reaction. It was probably for the better for everyone around me .",1
"Waited about 45 mins to be seated, but the food was 100% worth it. We ordered the soup dumplings and scallion pancake. I've wanted to try soup dumplings for so long and oh my goodness these were incredible! The flavors, the warmth, everything! Be careful not to burn your tongue when you eat the soup and it can get pretty messy (or maybe I'm not eating it right lol) The pancake is a must-try as well. (They don't except credit cards so make sure to bring cash!)The price was definitely worth and it's easy to see why this restaurant is so popular. I would recommend this place to everyone!",1
"Must go! 
Hole in the wall place with some awesome  Chinese food. Their pork soup dumplings and Shanghai fried rice are worth a try. They usually have a wait so go prepared for it. Their specials include spicy fish which is delicious and melts in your mouth. I am usually a fan of scallion pan cakes and had higher expectations from them but they were average here. 
The service is good quick, easy on your wallet and love the oranges in the end.",1
"Our first time ordering take out here and it exceeded our expectations! 

1. Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings (8)

63. Diced Chicken & Cucumber with Hot Pepper

67. Shrimp & Chicken in Plum Sauce

I couldn't get over how delicious the dumplings were (the crab added so much flavor). I will happily order the shrimp and chicken in plum sauce again, too (shrimp was nice quality). My husband likes spicy and he enjoyed the diced chicken and cucumber with hot pepper. Too bad they don't offer outdoor seating, but for now I will order again on Door Dash (very fast delivery and food arrived piping hot).",1
"The soup dumplings are on par! It's a little expensive, but you won't regret it!",1
"I like Joe's Shanghai but I had better xiao long bao's (like Din Tai Fung in Asia), but for the price, I can't really complain. My boyfriend & I ordered the pork and the combo (shrimp & pork). I like the flavor but one thing I have to complain about is the broth. The broth felt really oily and I also didn't like that the dumpling skins are really thick (okay, that's two complaints!).

We also ordered the Shanghai flat noodles and the Schezuan noodle soup. I liked those so no complaints about those.

Would come again.",1
Damn good Xiao Long Bao & Scallion Pancake. Pretty efficient service too. Hubby thought the shredded turnip buns were legit.,1
The best xiao long bao in the city! A trip to NYC won't be complete without a visit to Joe Shanghai.,1
This place is great. Soup dumplings and beers.,1
"Was here for a quick 2 day weekend in NYC and definitely wanted to try what everyone was hyping about. I think the pork ones are much tastier than the crab ones. The XLB here are huge! They're bigger than the ones at Din Tai Fung. 

We also had the Green Onion Pancake, Shanghai Beef Wok tossed noodles, and a plate of Garlic Sauteed Ong Choy. Yum. 2 crates of XLB. What I like about this place is the price and the generous ginger. 4 people $10 each. And when we wanted extra ginger he brought out a plate of ginger for me and my girlfriend. I was so happy! Worth the wait here even if the hostess is slightly mean.",1
"Tucked away on a bustling side street in NYC Chinatown, Joe's Shanghai was hopping when my husband and I arrived for early dinner.  They have only one table for two, so we first shared a round table with a single customer and two young women who spoke in Chinese.  After they left, two other groups joined the table.  We did not find the setup intrusive and were able to see close up other dishes which looked even better than what we ordered.  For starters, the crab and pork soup dumplings were fantastic.  I was expecting soup, but these eight large dumplings are served in a bamboo steamer over a bed of cooked cabbage.  They need no condiment; however the soy sauce with ginger shavings on the table was a nice addition.  I was eyeing another appetizer and was glad we ordered only the dumplings because they were more than enough for two.  For mains I got the Szechuan fish fillet, which was perfectly spiced and cooked and melted in my mouth.  It was served with bean sprouts (only) so may be best to share, as one person eating fish and sprouts may find it boring after a while.  I would have preferred a colorful veggie or two added.  My husband got the double cooked pork, which was notches above any carryout version we have ordered.  The complimentary hot tea and white rice were also good.  Service was fine and the wait was reasonable.  My suggestion for improvement is to remove the clutter--employees personal belongings in plain sight--and deep clean the entire place.  I had no sanitary concerns.  For esthetics only, as a sprucing up should improve the dining experience.",1
"Ver authentic food with excellent service! The dumplings are a must, perfectly steamed bursting with flavor with the first bite, we also had the pork fried rice and chicken and egg noodle dish, can't remember the exact name. The fried rice was some of the best I've had but the egg noodle dish was just ok, good but kind of bland. The food here is fairly priced and portions are definitely shareable. Will definitely be back on our next visit to New York. Our biggest selling point to eat here was not only good reviews but upon walking through Chinatown it was the only place that was packed.",1
"Believe the hype! 

I've been to the Joe's on W. 56th, but there's no place like the original on Pell. I've never waited outside a restaurant to get in. This night, we waited an hour and a half...in a drizzle...and it was way more than worth it. 

Why? Two words: soup dumplings! 

It's been said by many that Joe's makes the best soup dumplings in the world. And I'm one of those people. If you've never had one, imagine a pork dumpling. Huge. Soft (not the chunky dumplings that you get at your neighborhood Chinese restaurant). Now, when you bite into it a whole dumpling full of soup pours into your mouth (hopefully)! 

So after 2 big baskets of soup dumplings (we had a party of 5), we dug into some General Tso's chicken (awesome), Spicy Pepper Salt Prawns (amazing) Moo Shoo Pork (damn good) and Scallops and Prawns (mmmmmmm). Joe takes these classic Chinese restaurant staples to a whole new level. 

If you want a drink with dinner, they have beer and wine. If you're going for the wine, you have 2 choices: house red and house white. If you want rose, order half red/half white. 

Now, if you're hoping that this is a white tablecloth restaurant, keep hoping. This is a warm, inviting, packed place where you'll probably get to know the people at the tables next to you. You might feel like you're being rushed to eat and get out, but don't fall for that. Just take your time and enjoy some of the best Chinese food you'll ever eat - including the best soup dumplings you'll ever eat! 

The above is my opinion about Joe's. Now, I'll state a fact about Joe's. The night we went, it was cold and drizzling. Dozens of people were waiting in the cold rain to get in. Right across the street was another Chinese restaurant (afterall, this is Chinatown, Jake). Not only wasn't anyone waiting outside that restaurant, no one was in that restaurant. That should tell you all you need to know about Joe's.",1
"Excellent and Terrific portions

Pros: service, greeting, food, portions, lot of food for money, especially in NY, table cloth, nice table, canned drinks

Cons: very busy and be prepared to wait, comfortable in inside",1
"Best soup dumplings in the world. They only take cash, but so very worth it!! Can't wait to come back! The baby bok choy is very yummy too. Love this place. I would give it 10 stars if I could.",1
I am a dumpling lover and man these pork soup dumplings were huge and JUICY! So much flavor in just one bite and delicious. I could eat a whole order myself. I also ordered the shanghai noodles and they were nice and saucy. These two items are my go to's when I eat at a shanghainese restaurant. Would definitely go back!,1
"So much for keeping kosher Joe's Shanghai definitely lives up to all the hype. I can't think of anything more satisfying than a hot, soupy dumpling on a rainy NYC day. Even with a super packed house, I was seated immediately and served just as quick! If dumplings aren't your thing,  they should be! A must eat in NYC:)",1
"This place is great, best soup dumplings for now. Be careful, they are hot, and you might burn your lips.

Also like the beef lo mein as well.",1
"Eating soup dumplings is as nerve wracking as playing Jenga with your closest friends. It's great company, but if you break a dumpling and let the soup go too early, you will be publicly humiliated.

This was my first foray into soup dumplings and I'm quite pleased. They pack in different textures: the folded doughiness, the soup broth, the pork. 

Be sure to top them with some of the chili sauce and black vinegar.

My party of 3 only had to wait about 10 minutes on a Saturday at 12:45pm before being seated in a communal table (don't worry, we weren't expected to make awkward conversation with strangers. ""So aren't these dumplings as good as the spring weather right now, eh?"")

The scallion pancakes were nicely layered and served hot, I enjoyed those. 

My friend ordered some flash fried noodles with beef and broccoli that I thought were worth a pass, as they tasted like an above average version of generic takeout Chinese food. 

And now I can say I've tried jellyfish, which has a texture that resembles seaweed salad with less of a complex flavor. Yeah, we ordered jellyfish because why the heck not?

The price for all that food came down to about $14 a person, which is a real bargain in NYC.

Service here is spotty. I usually expect, as a bare minimum, to have a waiter stop by every so often to refill your water. That doesn't happen here, but there are a lot of waiters circling by that you can ask. 

This place is cash only which isn't awful either (if my meal costs $20 at a minimum, like at Katz's, then it's another story...)

I'm not a huge fan of them automatically adding a 15% service charge. I would have tipped that anyways, but when you force someone to pay a specific amount for service without prior notice (no notice like ""parties of 8 or more pay 20% service charge"" written on the menu), it serves as an excuse to be able to let the service slide.",1
"This place was my food staple when I lived in New York. Shanghai dumplings, Shanghai fried noodles and Onion pancake. It's all i get. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. The walk is a frikin hike through chinatown, but well worth it. I shed a tear thinking about this place. so many memories.  be sure to poke a hole into the top of ur dumpling and fill it wih the red vinegar. HIT!
I don't mind sharing tables with complete strangers, but you are so close, its an honest mistake if you reach over and crab one of their dumplings.  

JOE IS MY BRO.",1
Da-dumps are amazing! Love this place. Been many times. Highly recommend to everyone visiting New York as it's a staple,1
"Joe's Shanghai was better back in the day (late 90's) before it was ""discovered"" but I still love it.

Unless there are a lot of people in your party, you get seated at a large table for eight with a bunch of strangers. The only real downside to this communal seating is hoping that the other people don't hear you talking about them or catch you staring at their food while you try to figure out what they ordered and why it looks so much better than what you got.

As I said, Joe's was better back in the day. It was less crowded and I am convinced that the food was better, particularly the steamed pork buns that Joe's is so famous for. Eating here was much more laid back and you never felt like you had to leave quickly to make room for the next hungry group.  Service came with a smile instead of that hint of impatience when you don't know exactly what you want.

On the bright side, the portions haven't gotten any smaller and the prices haven't gotten any higher. I still recommend heading down for a good meal that starts off (of course) with soup dumplings and leaves you feeling satisfied, with a full stomach and barely a scratch on your wallet.",1
"This place is great! I came here as a party of 7 around 5:30 PM on Lunar New Years and beat the rush. As we were leaving, there was a large crowd outside waiting for seats.

We ordered an array of items: pork soup dumplings, crab and pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, sesame chicken, shredded pork and dried bean curd with jalapeno, string beans, Shanghai flat noodles, and steamed sea bass​. I thought everything was solid and everyone was so full for a very reasonable price. My favorite was definitely the soup dumplings since they were very flavorful and full of soup--the soup inside filled up my entire soup spoon! The sesame chicken was freshly fried and was still crispy under all of the sauce. The string beans were nice and charred from the wok.

I would recommend this location as opposed to the Midtown location since there is definitely a price difference and I think this location tastes a bit more authentic as well!",1
"Awesome place if you are craving dumplings. There were a lot of people when I was there. Place is not too big. The staff was kind and attentive. Bit loud there but the food was good. Luckily the dumplings were filled and big, not little filling with too much flour. I dislike dumplings like that. I don't like how the table needs to be shared with others. Wish there were separate tables.",1
"This place was amazing. We stayed at the 50 Bowery hotel right next door and decided to give this place a try on our last night since it was just a minute walk away. 

This place is cash only. There is an ATM right when you enter if you need cash for a fee. We arrived around 5 PM and were seated quickly as it was before their dinner rush, but the restaurant did fill up later on. 

We ordered the pork & shrimp dumplings, young chow fried rice, scallion pancakes and orange chicken. Coming from So Cal, we were used to paying more for less so we were pleasantly surprised on the price and portions. The dumplings were much larger than what we normally see and less expensive. The dumplings are listed under appetizers but for the portions you get, they are essentially a meal. We ordered a few different dishes, but would have been satisfied with just 2 orders of dumplings and the fried rice. 

Overall, the food and service were excellent. The tastes were all spot on for all our dishes. The broth in the dumplings came out hot and fresh. The scallion pancakes had a great crisp on the ends. Our server was very attentive to us despite the language barrier. This place is a must-try if you are ever in the Manhattan Chinatown area.",1
"Best soup dumplings! Everyone I asked about soup dumplings recommended Joe's Shanghai to get my fix and they weren't wrong. 

However, they are SUPER BUSY!! We only wanted soup dumplings so we called ahead to over for carry out and I recommend you do the same if you don't plan on sticking around. 

The dumplings were delicious. The skin was thick enough but also had a good amount of filling and soup, too. I'm sure it would've been even better had we eaten it hot in the restaurant but I thought the ones we had were delicious too.",1
"Really, really good place for weekend brunch: you just can't beat juicy, warm, tasty xiaolongbao for so cheap on a Sunday morning (or rather, early afternoon). Ignore the B rating posted at the front door: I have never felt weird after consuming massive amount of their food, and, unfortunate as it is, you honestly can't find that many Chinese restaurants that are both clean and still authentic (well, maybe I'll give you Cafe China). Just go straight to the soup-filled dumplings; the other dishes here are not really worth your time except as a palate cleanser. Also, try to arrive here at the opening time or slightly after: massive lines begin to form later in the afternoon, and I remember coming here at 3PM with a friend facing a three-hour wait.

Meanwhile, as you wait for your delicious baos to come out, look for that funny Sonia Sotomayor photo where she poses with the waitstaff. One would think Supreme Court judges don't spend their precious time eating $4.95 soup dumplings. Well, think again!",1
"One of the best xiao long bao in the city! 

Generally I'm not too impressed with NYC Chinatown dim sum places since I am from Vancouver. But when I am jonesjng for some good dumplings, I want to come here. 

Beware of the long lines, and the sharing of tables with strangers, if that kind of stuff bothers you.",1
"My Chinese friends Split on if this restaurant is ""authentic"" or not. All I know is that it is Delicious. I give it 5 stars for the Dumplings alone, they have other good dishes like the Bass and the baby bok choy is good. 

My girlfriend's mother is chinese and has lived in chinatown for decades and she swears by Joe's (yes i know it's not nice to swear!).

It's easily worth the price and the wait and it's right off Bowery so it's not like you'll have to travel too far. One of my favorite places in the city!",1
"This place is insanely popular- even an hour before it was closing, there was still a line outside. Tried both the pork and crab soup dumplings. Both had a ton of soup inside, which was greatly welcomed. Personally, I didn't get a huge crab taste (might be due to the amount of vinegar I use), but the pork filling definitely tasted good, and seemed more worth. We also tried some of the other noodle dishes, not bad but nothing stood out. Will definitely come again for their soup dumplings though!",1
"Love their Soupy Dumplings! Price is good, service is fast. Cash only. The only thing that bugs me is when the second you are done, the waitstaff cleans your table and can't wait for you to get out. They will stare you down. It is a busy place, I get it. 
Can I digest my dumplings please?",1
"While the service left something to be desired, the soup dumplings and the Shanghai noodles were incredible. 5 stars for the food, 3 stars for the service.",1
"Thank goodness they deliver on DoorDash because there's always such a long line whenever I pass by / take the trek down to Chinatown. The delivery service takes a very reasonable amount of time and the food is amazing. I love the soup dumplings here, probably one of the best I have found on the East Coast so far.",1
"Only waited 10-15 min for 2 people on Saturday just before 6pm, though it was packed with long lines. Interior is very pretty. 

Food is 10/10. Ordered soup dumplings and wonton soup, they are listed under appetizers but are actually very large portions and I would consider them entrees in portion size. Soup dumplings are enormous with a TON of soup! None of them were torn either. Szechuan beef was really tasty, it was a huge plate meant for family-style sharing. Beef was tender and full of flavor. We also had a simple fried rice with only scallions and egg, I normally am never impressed by fried rice but this fried rice was not too salty, not bland, very light. Best fried rice I've ever had. I can't pick a favorite menu item as everything we ordered was excellent. They also have an enormous menu (way bigger than online), so I was really impressed they cooked all our dishes to perfection.

Service is 10/10. These waiters are the most efficient waiters I've ever seen and basically knew what you wanted and do it before you could ask. They will bring extra small bowls, large spoons, extra plates as soon as they serve each dish because dishes are family-style and they know you're going to share. They don't waste your time talking your head off, they just take your order, help you choose items if you ask, and just silently and quickly remove old dishes, give you new ones. And they clean up and turn over an old table to serve new guests in like 10 seconds. I know this might be an odd thing to go on about, but I was genuinely so impressed. I've been to a few fancy restaurants before, but Joe's Shanghai waiters knock them all out of the park. 

Tip is included in the bill as an 18% service charge (you don't tip on top of it unless you want to). Cash only like most Chinatown places. I hope come back often!!",1
"Expect to be quick when ordering...which is good because that means the quicker you get to taste the delicious soup dumplings. We ordered the pork dumplings and yes they where the best I have ever had. We also ordered the Kung pao, sesame chicken, spicy prawns and green beans. I enjoyed the sesame chicken the best, so much flavor and tasted great.",1
Soup dumpling is very good. I have to wait 30min to eat but Its really worth. Best dumpling ever,1
Delicious and extremely affordable. I come here every time I'm in Manhattan. The dumplings are awesome!!! I've tried many other dishes and they've all been good but I prefer to just have lots of dumplings!!!,1
"Oh, soup dumplings, how I love you. Don't go here if you are into excellent, attentive service. This is not the place for that kind of experience. Servers aren't mean or anything, but its a very efficient ship that's run here. You order what you want, you get it, you enjoy it and you're out. That said, the food is delicious and the soup dumplings are a must-try for those who haven't partaken. A culinary treat for sure.",1
"I'm giving Joe's in Chinatown 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons. One I have yet to try the one in Queens which I hear is the best of all three and two I've only had their dumplings but, HOLY AWESOME DUMPLINGS! 

Dumplings are one of my favorite foods and Joe's was my first experience with soup dumplings. They were very yummy but the one thing that skeeved me out was, the ""soup"" inside the dumplings coagulates on the plate and makes you feel kinda gross for eating it. Oh and get the pork soup dumplings. The crab/pork ones aren't as good. Also, the pork fried dumplings are TO DIE for. I Highly recommend them.

P.s. I had some questions as to whether or not you can reheat the soup dumplings after they are cold and the ""soup"" hardens. Well, you can and it will get soupy again. Just pop them in the microwave for 30-45 secs and you should be good.

Happy Eating!",1
amazing soup dumplings as everyone knows.  What everyone doesn't know is that other items on the menu are delicious as well.  Baby clams in black bean sauce and the crispy orange beef are my faves.,1
"Good lord, this place is delicious and crowded because you can't get a good ""siu lohng bao"" (soup dumpling) in Chicago, that's for sure!  I don't care for the crab ones, they taste a little funny, kind of like old egg yolk.  Go for the meat!  I also love the Shanghai noodles, which are thicker and shorter than udon and slightly wavy.  It is mixed with vegetables (cabbage?) and pork.  There's another location in Flushing, Queens, and they are both equally great!",1
There is community seating with 11 people per round table. I was apprehensive with sharing a table with strangers at first but it was actually a nice environment. Food came super fast and it was delicious,1
One of the best authentic NYC Chinatown dining experiences you can get. Huge banquet style tables make this a fun place to go with a group of friends. Two words: SOUP DUMPLINGS!!,1
"Truly the soul food of Asian cuisine is XLB's. Between the rich fatty broth inside the bun to the densely flavorful meat and skin, it's impossible not to recognize XLBs in a class of its own.

Joe's Shanghai is no different. The simplicity of the ingredients and the familiarity of consistently low prices makes this establishment one to remember. It was featured in many foodie lists and mainstream travel shows but they still serve humble dishes for the everyday person. The portions are good, the food tasty and unpretentious. The XLBs are steamed in a bamboo pot and served to you in it as well. Be careful not to burn yourself with the broth. It's very easy to get carried away. 

The seating is quite horrendous. If you're not coming in a group of 4 or 5, expect to be communally seated and not in that trendy hipster coffee house kind of way. It's more like in a round table forcing you to stare away at something than to look someone in the eye while you're eating. If that doesn't bother you, go ahead and enjoy the food in the simplest, most practical way.",1
"Delish xiao long Bao in US..
Very good service!!
Order crispy fried duck!!
Thanks to my sister for her recommendation",1
"We came in for a pretty late dinner so the notorious line wasn't as long as usual which was nice! We ordered the pork soup dumpling as well as the pork & crab soup dumpling and they were both extremely tasty!! Soup was very flavorful, but the skin was a little thick. 

We also got the eggplant in szechuan sauce and the string beans sauteed with garlic and pork. Although they were both tasty, I must say that the vegetables were rather soggy and extremely oily. While I would give it a 5 for flavor, it's not the place to get fresh vegetables! 

Finally, we got the twice cooked pork! Again, flavor was good but it was extremely oily and they gave us much more cabbages than actual pork which was kind of a downer. 

Overall very satisfied with the food, it's definitely a place to go in NYC!",1
"Omg. I still have dreams about this place. Their dumplings are literally the best thing I have ever tasted! The community seating is a bit weird, and there was no public restroom (unless we just didn't look hard enough). Despite all of that, this place deserves 5 stars! We recommend it to anyone who tells us they are visiting NYC, and we can't wait to go back ourselves. I might just hop on a 5 hour flight just for this...",1
It's all about the shao long bao.  Very delicious and well worth it.  It can get pretty crowded in there so go in prepared that you might share a table with someone.,1
"Truly the end of an era. This new location is GORGEOUS and brand spanking new. The decor is simple and not overwhelming however I will forever reminisce about their old location filled with photos of famous visitors to the location as well as the fear of being run over by cars navigating down the one way street as we wait for our number to be called. The food here is luckily the same quality as their old location however the speed of the dishes were so slow. We came during an off lunch hour and the restuarant was not at all busy. However each dish took a significant amount of time to arrive at our table. 

DIshes we love here: crab and pork dumplings, shanghai thick noodles, string beans, shrimp with meat sauce. You can not go wrong with ANY of these.",1
"place is pretty good and decently priced.

besides the dumplings we ordered something on the noodles page called subgum friend noodles.  i wont spoil the surprise but it was actually pretty good.  who knew! lol go for it = ]

one of the things i do dislike tho is the fact that they use the same hand towel to scrub down every table so it leaves that dirty, old, raggedy smell behind on the table top for at least 20 mins.",1
"Stopped in the other day while in Chinatown. We wanted to try some ""must have eats"" while visiting  New York and Joes Shanghai was on our list and was also recommended by my brother. Mom and I ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings and a side of scallion pancakes. According to our waiter, these two items were the most popular on their menu. Soon as we bit into the dumplings, we were delighted by a nice creamy porky crabby surprise sitting in a slurp size spoonful soup. I don't know any way to describe it other than it was a nice meal for a cold winter day. The scallion pancakes were also a delight as well. It was crispy and came with a side of soy sauce for dipping. This is a very popular restaurant so the lines getting on do get long. Lucky for us, we didn't have to wait at all. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. I'd come back again",1
"Love this place, always bring out of towners. Classic spot for soup dumplings in China town. Other dishes are good as well. Not the cleanest and the service is not the best, but that is part of the experience. Can be a long wait at popular times. Good place for big groups.",1
"Came here per my friend's recommendation while visiting NYC and I'm glad I did! It's cash only by the way but they have an ATM inside so no worries there.

We ordered the scallion pancake, the pork soup dumplings, chicken fried rice, and the garlic eggplant. Everything was delicious, we enjoyed the soup dumplings a lot. The only complaint I would have is that the table was really small so we had to play a game of Tetris to fit all of the dishes/plates on the table.",1
"Two words: Soup Dumplings.

Family style seating and overly anxious servers. We went during non peak hours and the place was busy. Get there early for seats--get there later and you'll surely be waiting in line.

The food is a bit greasy, however, people mainly come here for the soup dumplings--they are a cut above absolutely amazing!",1
"i am giving 5 stars for the best pork steamed dumplings ever !!!! 

check this place out :)",1
"It's not all just hype, the soup dumplings are legit. Had the pork and crab dumplings and they were very tasty, rich flavor... I wanted to order seconds.

Not sure why people are raving over the scallion pancake, I didn't think they were anything special. 

A couple next to us ordered either Seasame or a type of General Tso chicken and it looked so good I wanted to ask to try a piece. Isn't that why there's communal seating? ;)  

The communal seating isn't terrible but it isn't a fancy or clean looking place. It's Chinatown.  But the dumplings are def worth a visit.",1
"Ok, for me the best bang for my buck was here at Joes Shanghai!! I found out this place was ridiculously good through a friend who frequents NYC often and loves to save money. 

If u can find this little hole in the wall Shanghai style Chinese restaurant you may have found the holy Grail of dumpling spots in NYC! First, let me just say they are famous for their dumplings with broth inside, you eat it with a spoon and chopsticks. You top it with some vinegar and soy ginger and you are set!! 

This place was absolutely packed on a Wednesday and we ended up sitting at a table for six with another family of five. We didn't mind sharing a table because they had been here before and they drove 4 hours from D.C just for dumplings!!! 

So we ordered one Crab and one Pork dumpling. They come 8 to an order and it's under $5 bucks!!! We also ordered some shanghai noodles and a scallion pancake which were also out of this world good!!! Our total bill was under 25 bucks and we finished it all!!! 

Not only did the food come out really fast, they even got my gf water when she asked for it and refilled it without asking! For me that was definitely a first in any crowded restaurant!! 

Joes Shanghai don't change a thing! I'm coming back soon, it's only a 5 hour flight and a jump on the 6 train!!!",1
"i went yesterday w my bf and couldn't wait to post this review!! we got there at around 4pm on a very rainy sunday and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. this place is always packed with crowds of people rotating out of every table. the service is efficient, quick, and all you have to do is politely flag down one of the many servers whenever you need anything. they're all so nice and attentive and the FOOD?! there are truly no words for how delicious, delectable, authentic, and plentiful the cuisine is. we literally couldn't stop eating. im having the leftovers as i type this and they're somehow just as good. i'm eating slowly to savor it all! the soup dumplings are so rich the broth sticks to your lips and ribs. the crispy beef absolutely fucking blew us away. idk why but we had very low expectations for it, but omg!! i would order two plates of this next time, one to take home untouched lol. the duck was melt in your mouth, and the half serving was more than enough for two people. the scallion pancakes, i could eat everyday for the rest of my life. they heat up so well in the oven and also melt in your mouth. even the fried rice (with eggs and green onions) was so simple but perfect. i can't say enough great things. this place should have 3.5 stars (iykyk), it's that good. make sure you bring cash!!",1
"I'm literally addicted to this place. When I least expect it, I am hit by a strong craving for the hot and flavorful juice of the pork soup dumplings. 

The dumplings are consistently good no matter where or when you go. I have yet to find another dish that I really like here so I pretty much just order the dumplings. 

Cash only at the Chinatown location, cards accepted at the Times Square location.
I never wait longer than 20-30 minutes at the peak hours. The communal seating is fun and you'll meet some people from all over the world.",1
Visiting NY for the week and these other reviews were on point. Great food and quick service! We sat in a big round table with other guests which was different but ok since there was plenty of space. We will make it a point to come back here if we are ever back in NY. Pork dumplings were on point.,1
Great soup dumplings. Usually long lines.,1
"Went here per reviews and were nicely surprised. It was a very popular place with great food and fast service. The biggest problem was they only take cash, they do have an ATM out front though. There seems to be a long wait for people but our group of 10 got in quick, we were lucky. If they're busy and you are a small party, they will seat you at a big round table with other small parties.
Their menu is great, they are well known for their soup dumplings which were only eight dollars. Decent prices as well!
As is prevalent in New York, they do not like you to sit around and enjoy, it is an eat and go environment. Also, no free refills on anything but water.
Would definitely recommend, great experience!",1
I went to This restaurant today with my cousin and i had an amazing experience! We ordered The pork soup dumpings mushu pork and Hong Kong style noodles! Very friendly employees and amazing food! This is a must have place in new York!,1
A Chinatown classic to be experienced while visiting NYC. The crab dumplings are true to their Shanghai roots. Coupled with an order of veggies and some green tea and your good to go.,1
"Good soup dumpling, expect to wait 30-60mins on weekend.
No reservation system, you'll need to walk-in.",1
"Great restaurant, well priced in Chinatown. Their dumplings are the best in town and everyone is super friendly and take care of you fast. I have been here several times and compared to other competitors that are close by and nothing is as good as them, both service and food!",1
"Two words. SOUP DUMPLINGS. Joe's Shanghai is know for their soup dumplings and they are amazing. Always a great place for food. Always busy so you'll probably have to wait to get in there. FYI the restaurant is cash only! Other than that good food, nice atmosphere, and clean.",1
Five stars for absolutely delectable mouthwatering soup dumplings! I definitely don't dig the whole table sharing though. It's truly uncomfortable but the food always drags me back here,1
"SLB were very soupy and good.  Scallion pancakes were good as well - they're not my preferred way of having them cooked, but I liked them.  They're crispy on the outside, very greasy, and chewy on the inside.  Not all the slices in the scallion pancake were uniform, so some tasted better than others.  My husband ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and said it tasted fine...just like Pei Wei.  Total bill for 1 order of SLB, Scallion Pancake, Kung Pao Chicken, and Coke - $30 including the 15% automatic tip.",1
"We arrived around 3pm on a Saturday and were told it would be a 20 minute wait for a party of 2. We waited less than 5 minutes and were called to our table. 

We've been wanting to try their famous soup dumplings for years and todays the day we finally did. We ordered their pork soup dumplings. 

I wasn't sure how to eat them at first so I glanced to the table next to us. I saw they used chopsticks to poke at the dumplings and to let the soup drain out into the spoon. So, that's what I did. It was a little messy to eat but I got the hang of it. 

The pork soup dumplings were delicious and were perfect on this 30 degree day.

Remember, it's a cash only restaurant!",1
"Well - I'm from Queens so I usually go-to the restaurant in Flushing.  My fav dishes are obviously the soup dumplings, Joe Shanghai Fried Flat Noodles, Sesame Chicken & the shrimp/prawns with chili sauce ( I ask for the shell off ).  The table situation is for sure different than most restaurants.  They have giant round tables and you can be seated with complete strangers.  A tad awkward if you sit down and they get their food first and you are starving, Its torture!  Don't expect the best service, but expect some delicious eats!",1
"not bad for just general chinese food! they had a pretty large menu from dimsum to more typical restaurant dishes. service was especially good, the waiters brought us extra wraps for the duck since we had more people. 

scallion pancakes (8/10) - hit the spot, crispy but not oily! would recommend for sharing

pork xiao long baos (9/10) - some of the better xlbs i've had in ny! i prefer xlb that doesn't have really thick skin so this was perfect for me.

peking duck (7/10) - pretty standard but portion was kinda small for half a duck. only comes with 4 wraps by default. 

string beans (8/10) - pretty standard but this dish is still a great choice for veggies

stir fry tofu and veggies (9/10) - waiter recommended this as an add-on and it was surprisingly good! the tofu really gets all the flavor and there's a wide assortment of veggies included 

梅菜扣肉 (pickled vegetable pork belly? not sure the english menu item name) (5/10) - the sauce felt to thick and salty for my taste. and the pork belly slices were also really thick and a bit too fatty. wasn't terrible but would pass since there's better items!",1
Good dumplings and food. The wait time wasn't so bad for a weekday around 7.,1
"Of all the food I've tried in New York, this place has got to be my favorite !!!

My friends and I were lucky when we came here because there was no wait! This place kind of smells funky though. I think it's the vinegar they put on every table. 

Of course we had to get the soup dumplings ! We ordered 2 orders of the crab and pork mix dumplings, crispy beef, and shanghai noodles.

I felt like I was in heaven when I tasted the soup dumpling for the first time. It was so good!!!!!!! The hot tasty soup burst in your mouth when you first bite into the dumpling. Oh man.... Salivating at the moment. The filling was so tasty and you can really taste the crab. I tried it with the vinegar but it was too overpowering. I just want to taste the goodness of the dumpling! Add some sate chili for a bit of kick. 

The crispy beef was well... Crispy. It was tasty. A lot of batter though, and it kind of tastes like orange chicken. Eat it with some steamed rice and you're set!

The shanghai noodles was good and flavorful as well. Nothing too special about it though. 

If I ever get to come back here... I would order like 3 trays of soup dumplings for myself!!!!!",1
"People say it's touristy..... well then f*ck it i'm a tourist baby! 

Soup dumplings: oh ya 
Green beans with pork: yes
Crispy orange beef: Don't like from anywhere EXCEPT Joe's",1
"My group of 4 got lucky as we got seated right away when we came for lunch around noon. We were seated in one of the larger tables and shared with a family of 4. The table was big enough so it wasn't so awkward. The place was already so busy with diners. Service was REALLY fast, non-stop and quick. Our server wasn't the nicest. Seemed like he wanted us out faster than in. The table comes with hot tea to self serve. We ordered their famous and popular soup dumplings and scallions as starters. I didn't eat any of the soup dumplings because they don't offer a vegetarian or just seafood options (*SIGH*) but everyone seemed to have loved it. The scallions were very yummy and I was tempted to order another round but saved my hunger for the main dishes to share. I went with the Stewed Mixed Vegetables and Bean Curd with Crab Sauce. Both very tasty and plenty to share with 4. A ton of options for all types. Don't miss out on this hidden place if you're running around Chinatown.",1
I think I probably waited 40 minutes to get a seat here but it was well worth the wait. I was in a party of 2 so we ended up getting seated at one of the large round shared tables. The restaurant is small and very crowded and you may need to sit with others so just keep that in mind. The food blew me away! I think it's the best XLB I've ever had. The dumpling skin is so thin that the soup looks like it's going to break through the skin when you pick it up (I hate it when the skin is really thick and doughey). We tried both the pork and crab/pork dumplings. Both were very very good. The only caveat to this place is the long wait - otherwise I'd be here every time I visited NYC.,1
"This place has some of the best Chinese food in Chinatown in my opinion. My friend and I came here on a Tuesday night, which is the best time to go for that it's pretty empty. We got a table to ourselves which was a plus because it came to my attention that people do have to share their table with strangers sometimes depending on where you sit. 

We ordered the scallion pancakes (which are to die for) the infamous soupy dumplings, which I freaking loved, general tso chicken that was okay, rice, and the braised pork shoulder. The pork shoulder was pretty good, but also pretty expensive. I definitely plan on returning to this place, but only during the week so I don't have to end up standing on a line for god knows how long.",1
"Joe's Shanghai gives the new meaning to the term ""awesome goodness"".  

In Joe's world, awesome goodness comes in the form of a bamboo steamer with eight crab and pork xiao long bao, or mini steamed dumplings filled with minced meat and just the right amount of broth.  

The space was cramped enough to make any self-respecting fire safety inspector weep with frustration: large lazy-susaned round tables near the back of the room, which serve as communal tables where patrons - locals and guidebook-holding tourists alike - dine; high waiter-to-patrons ratio; a ton of hungry patrons loitering outside hopeful that the wait for an empty space wouldn't be that long (and it wasn't, as said waiters were not shy at making sure people get in, get served, and get out in the shortest time possible).  

If you ever visit NYC, Joe's Shanghai is a definite must-see.  And with total bil coming up to $29.60, our group of six well-fed, pleasantly plump individuals still had enough to spend at nearby Soho.",1
"These soup dumplings will haunt you long after you have left those smelly, too-small, overcrowded streets of chinatown. Can't really speak to the other food, but if it was actually dog food aside these golden lilttle dumplings of heaven, it would still warrant a 5 star. Yeahyeahyeah- soup inside is hot and takes a college level course of its own to learn how to eat them, but isn't that part of the appeal?",1
"Go to spot for soup dumplings! The food is really good and service isnt the worse for how busy it gets! 
They also have some bomb af shanghai noodles and rice cakes if you arent feeling soup dumplings tho",1
"Love the soup dumplings.  Other dishes are good too, but it is the dumplings that the restaurant is known for.",1
"I love XLB anyway.  But, I brought my mom here.  She liked it.  when ya momma likes it, ya gotta love it!  =)

my memory is fuzzy, but don't you have to share seats with people?  If so, how very ""authentic.""",1
"PORK & CRAB SOUP DUMPLINGS!!!! 
If you go to Joe's Shanghai and don't try their soup dumplings, then you're doing something wrong! (some ppl at our table ALMOST missed out until the Chinese couple told them they MUST get the soup dumplings)

Once you get seated, you're most likely gonna be sitting with 2 or 3 other groups of people (each table fits about 10 ppl). The dumplings come out in nice little wooden steam pots. When you're picking up your dumplings, be super careful so the soup doesn't spill out. Don't think you're all good to go only because you have your dumpling on your spoon! Even more carefully, bite the top of the dumpling and drink the soup inside first. If you just shove it in your mouth, you will end up with the soup all over your plate/hands/table. 

There's going to be a wait, but pretty worth it :) It's really crowded inside & you may not feel totally comfortable sitting with strangers, but that's part of the whole experience, so enjoy it~  

CASH ONLY!!",1
"Soup dumplings! Omg, had to be one of the best soup dumplings I had, it was so tasty and delicious. Very affordable and service was really fast. The restaurant is pretty small, and it's pretty busy here so don't be surprised if there's a wait. The only thing I wasn't a fan of, was that we had to share a table, which would've been fine if they had asked us first, but basically were just seated and told that we had to share our table with two strangers.

If ever in the area, these dumplings are definitely a must.",1
"The dumplings here were so so so juicy and delicious. The dumplin skin was also not too thick. We got there at around 10:00 pm, which was perfect because there was no line, and we were seated immediately. The waiters were very fast and our food came within 10 minutes. You'll probably be placed at a big table that is shared with a few other parties, but everyone minds their own business so it's not really an issue. It's very packed and busy though, so probably not the best place to go for a date.",1
"This is by far my favorite Shanghai place to go to. Always a line, always loud, always a rush, but ALWAYS DELICIOUS!

of course i recommend the steamed dumplings. DEF crab if you eat seafood, but pork is good too. not to sound annoying but they're scalding so find a way to eat them without burning yourself, spilling all the soup and looking like an idiot trying to cool the contents with your mouth opening - you'll possibly be sharing a table with strangers.

As for the other dishes, i have no idea of the name bc i order them in chinese, but the scallion pancakes are good, we get a thicker noodle dish with meat and veg, there is also this crispy white noodle that has a saucy topping and makes the noodles soft which is good, i get the simple shanghai fried rice minus the scallions (so just egg and rice) but i use this wonderfully simple dish so that i can soak up excess soup (if i even manage to drop any) so that i don't waste a single drop!

it's a quick in and out atmosphere. many tourists, many regs and they combine tables (heads up to anyone who doesn't know how asian places can roll).

yum! :)",1
"oh my. the soup dumplings truly were out of this world, reflected in the five stars (which i stingily dish out, so it really was GREAT). i'd go back in a heartbeat if it wasn't so far.

*ordered the crab and pork",1
"Excellent food in this tiny little hot spot. Apparently this is the go to spot for soup dumplings for all the celebrities so when I went to visit New York, I had to check it out. 

We ordered some pork soup dumplings and crab soup dumplings, as well as some scallion pancakes and cold fish and cold jellyfish. The soup dumplings were really good but I would recommend that you order multiple orders separately. We ordered two of each kind and when we started on the second batch, the 'soup' on the inside of the dumplings was soaked up in the near already. The scallion pancakes were good but weren't anything special. The cold fish had an extra fishy taste and smell (no thanks!) and the jellyfish was good. 

Overall a good experience but maybe not worth the wait (this place gets packed every night and there's almost always a wait). There are plenty of other places in Chinatown with good soup dumplings!",1
The soup dumplings are okay but I wouldn't say they're worth the 3 hr wait. I wish they weren't so stingy with the vinegar. Like it's just vinegar!!!!!!! Just give one vinegar a person and do some extra dishes! How do you expect people to share vinegar in this day and age.,1
"Dumplings! They're the draw, but the rest of the menu is solid, too!

It'd been years between visits. They even relocated to the Bowery from Pell St in the intervening time! The experience was still very familiar. About a 20-30 minute wait in the street for a table, followed by excellent pork soup dumplings and less gratifying pork and crab dumplings (skip them and double down on the pork). Their eggplant in garlic sauce was delicious. Scallion pancakes were solid as an app, but nothing to write home about. 

It was a nice visit that lived up to expectations and recollections in all respects, except that the space is brighter, cleaner, and far newer. I do, however, miss the pictures posted in the old space. I'd recommend it!",1
"There is a reason there is a line here 20 minutes before opening. They have the best soup dumplings in the city. Maybe the best anywhere. The new digs on Bowery is a vast improvement over the old place on Pell Street and closer from the subway station. The soup dumplings are a 5. The veggie lo mein was OK but needed more variety of vegetables and no tofu. I don't consider tofu to be a vegetable. It's more like discarded shoe leather. To be fair the noodles were not overdone and had a nice bite to it. Service was good and efficient. I believe Yelp claims that Joe's Shanghai accepts credit cards. Sorry, but it is cash only. There were others in line who realized that and had to find a money machine or eat elsewhere. Sure, we have never had a bad meal in New York 's Chinatown but there's a reason we and others make a beeline to Joe's.",1
"I have been eating here once a week for years. Perhaps not the most beautiful interiors, but the best soup dumplings on the planet.",1
"I've been coming here since I was young as I've always loved the soup dumplings.  The only reason I took off a star is because I went back recently and felt the quality had slipped a little.  I felt the same when I went back a year ago but thought it could have been a fluke.  

Today you can find many great soup dumplings in the city (although this is the original) so I'd suggest branching out (after you've tried Joe's).",1
"Looking at all the reviews on yelp, I thought this place would be pretty popular but we walked into a half full restaurant for lunch on a Friday. Also it's in an alley street just south of Canal street. Surprised that they make you share a larger table with another smaller group. It makes sense when it's busy but there were other empty tables. Anyways ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings right away. Then we decided on the seafood chow mein as our other dish. It was just enough food for three girls without having to take any leftovers home. The dumplings came out quickly. I, of course, couldn't wait to try it so I actually burned my tongue a bit on my first slurp of that soup. I liked the skin was thin and there was plenty of flavorful soup inside. I couldn't really taste the crab so I would maybe just stick with the pork ones next time. I still gotto say my favorite xio long bao is still from Din Tai Fung here in California. The chow mein was a bit oily but I liked the sauce and the thick noodles. And they put a lot of seafood in there - shrimp, scallops, and squid. I felt like they should because it's like $13 for that dish and twice as much if we had just gotten the chicken or beef version. I would totally eat here again for their soup dumplings.",1
"You can get the best soup dumplings!!!!
Other foods are also fantastic, too!
Great taste, very reasonable price,....always full. You have to wait 30-an hour in dinner time, but it worth to wait!

Don't forget to bring cash.",1
Files of lost pictures that inspired a review from a person with #fatboyproblems. First trip to New York back in 2012 and I've never had or even heard of soup dumplings aka xiao long bao! I was taken to this place to eat and boy oh boy to my surprise I'd found something that I like as much as noodle dishes! I will definitely be back here agian when I'm I'm new york!,1
I was on a mission to try the best soup dumpling in the country. That's exactly what I did. If you travel deep into China town and down a scary little back alley then you find the soup dumplings you seek. We came right when the place opened to avoid crazy waits and got seated right away. The green onion pancake was delicious. We got two orders of soup dumplings because they were that good. My boyfriend still brings them up although it's been months since our trip. One of the few spots I will go out of my way to visit again next time I am in town.,1
"I always find myself going here whenever I am in Chinatown. I absolutely LOVE this place! I highly recommend getting there early so you don't have to wait too long because it gets packed! It is a very touristy spot, but I don't mind because the soup dumplings are so good!",1
"This place has the best soup dumplings ever....a must try, never had a bad meal here, definitely a recommend to anyone who likes dumplings or Chinese food",1
"This place never disappoints. Everything I've had here over the many years I've been coming has been consistently delicious. The soup dumplings are huge and flavorful. The scallion pancake is flaky and so so good. The real winner though, is the string beans with minced pork. Every bite we took, my friend and I had to discuss how good it was. They're somehow cooked and flavorful but still as crisp as if they were freshly picked. This place is a must!!!",1
"We came at 6:00 PM and had to wait an hour to be seated. The crab and pork soup dumplings are a must get. As you bite into the dumplings a rich soup broth bursts in your mouth. 

We also got the sesame chicken and off the menu broccoli in garlic sauce. Both sauces were very thick and rich so I don't recommend getting both and would suggest to get some sides of rice as a pallet cleanser 

* You don't come here for the nice atmosphere or to have a long drawn out dinner. We were in an out in 35 minutes (yes even after ordering and eating all that food). The servers hover around you and the second you are done with the dish they grab the plate before you can put the serving spoon down. 

Had to knock them to 4 stars because of how uncomfortable the 5 servers standing over your shoulder felt.",1
I went there my first night in NYC. It was great. If you look for an intimate place you better go to another restaurant cause they offer large circle tables. Thus several people can sit around one table. The food is really good! It's definitely a place to good with friends and enjoy real Asian food!,1
"Very good but would not wait in a long line for it

Recommended:
* Soup dumplings are indeed very good, can't go wrong here.
* Lions head meatballs very soft and great taste

Above average:
* Fish filet in wine sauce was tasty altho a little salty
* Beef with scallions ($13.5 after tax). Beef quality is definitely above average for chinatown. Dish was a bit too saucy but good enough.

Just okay:
* shanghai fried noodles with pork decent but nothing special.

I recommend takeout or going in when its not so busy.",1
"I agree this place isn't quite worth a very long wait (try New Green Bo or Shanghai Gourmet or Moon House), but if you happen to come during an off-hour, check it out!  You can order your food while waiting, so it's ready once you sit down.  Warning: you'll probably be seated at a table with strangers, you'll be shooed off once you're done with your meal, and it's REALLY loud.

Along with the soup dumplings (I personally like the normal ones w/out crab) and other Shanghai dimsum, I recommend the braised pork shoulder.  It's REALLY fatty, but tasty, and excellent over rice.",1
"1ST THING u should order is soup dumplings- shao long bao. The price is so cheap and they are delicious! Foood is great and service was good too. But my only complaint is the interior of the resturant, the light was dim and it looked kind of shady. Dont be mistakened though because the food is delicious. Other notable dishes are the singaporean noodles and fried man tao",1
"I had lunch here when I was in Manhattan for a visit. My friends brought me here and we had dumplings. I thought the dumplings were very good and fresh.  The same quality you get in San Francisco Chinatown, but I prefer the Bay Area Chinese food, overall. The onion bread was very good too. Similar to how my mom's makes it, but of course not as good as mom's.  I could tell this place is a local favorite. I saw a few white collar workers were having lunch here and they seem to really enjoy it.",1
"Best (Xiao long bao) soup dumplings I've had anywhere and blows LA's Din Tai Fung out of the water. Expect a wait. Expect chaotic (but organized) service. Be open to sharing a round table with strangers. Their regular pork soup dumplings are the best. The crab and pork ones are good too but can sometimes have a fishy taste. I have but usually don't order other Chinese dishes on their menu since the dumplings make a great meal on their own. Worth the wait! This is a repeat visit resto for me, and the quality has remained consistent over the years.",1
"Do book ahead of time if you want to go to this place with a large party! This place gets crowded at night especially on the weekends!

The best dish i remember getting from this place is their onion pancake. What makes it great is their dipping sauce, which is sweet soy sauce (genius)! 

Other than that, their soup dumplings are alright, some of my friends complain that it doesn't taste fresh, but i have no complaints (do try their crab filling dumplings). The dough is thin and the soup was tasty. 

Their rice dishes are quite authentic, but their noodle dishes are rather oily and just not well made. I feel like there are better places than this over hyped restaurant in China town if you're really looking for good soup dumplings and authentic chinese food. Overall, not a bad restaurant.",1
"Came here to get that NYC experience as a tourist lol. We had the pork soup dumplings my husband and I both enjoyed them very much he's usually very picky about greasy food but he didn't think it was greasy or salty. However they are filling so we could only finish two baskets and took the rest home. I order a soup which had thick noodles and some kind of red broth was super greasy and could not finish it hence the 4 stars. Lo mein was greasy as well but good and had this smoky flavor. I wouldn't recommend the entrees here unless u want clogged arteries, however  I do recommend the soup dumplings.",1
"OMG.. I love their soup dumplings!! It was soooo good! The dumpling was good without any sauce added to it. They give you a small dish of vinegar sauce and I feel like it just overpowers all the flavor of the soup dumpling.. Be careful when taking your first bite into the dumpling though.. It will burst out with hot soup! Don't burn your tongue! But the the soup was so yummy I did not want to loose any at all! I would try to sip as much as I can before it drips on my plate... As for what kind we got.. We got the crab and pork meat mixed together.. YUMM!! We got two orders for 4 people.. Honestly we could have eaten more.. But we ordered more plates so we didn't want to over order.. Wish I could have had more though because the other plates we ordered was ehh... We got the shanghai flat noodles.. I felt like it tasted like regular stir fried noodles.. Nothing special.. And we got the crispy beef plate as well.. Ehhhhhhh I seriously thought it was all batter.. No beef at all.. And tastes like orange chicken... SERIOUSLY! Should have just ate more soup dumplings!! 

I give this place 4 stars because the only good thing was their soup dumplings.. Their other plates was just mediocre Chinese food plates.. Blah!",1
"Soup steam dumpling is the best. Very nice and fresh taste. Must to have here.
Beijing duck is not good, eatable but below average. Too dry and not well seasoned.",1
"- everyone goes for their soup dumplings, that's pretty much all you need to know, anything else on their menu can be had anywhere else and would probably be better elsewhere, but their soup dumplings have yet to be matched",1
Some of the best dumplings I've ever had. Definitely know why they are known for them! Everything we ordered was great and very reasonably priced. For sure need to make this a stop!,1
"The hot & sour soup is smooth and sharp and simply wonderful. Pork dumplings, fried or steamed: very good.  But it was the prawns with a snazzy chili sauce that really made me say, hey that was a nice taste sensation. Bravo! The service is pleasant and very talented, too.",1
"Came here for a last minute dinner with a friend. Located down in an alley in Chinatown, this place was very crowded and for good reason. 

The menu of not extensive, but what they have is delicious. We ordered the Shanghai Cabbage  and Szechuan Beef Tendon Noodle Soup. Though these aren't their most popular dishes, we were absolutely stuffed by them.

The interior is your classic Chinese restaurant, nothing to write home about there though perhaps a little bit aged and worn out looking. It feels like it needs a little freshening up. Perhaps a new coat of paint or a change of the wall-to-wall carpet? 

The tables are all designed to seat 10 persons, so dinner is family style, just don't lose your meal on the giant Lazy Susan in the middle of the table.  

You need to be aware that this place is a cash only establishment! Don't even think about paying by credit card. 

Now the reason that I'm giving it only four stars is because my friend and I felt very neglected by the waiter. We had to call him over multiple times to either order drinks or get the check. When the check was requested, they began removing our plates, even though we still had food on them and weren't quite ready to head out. We only wanted to pay the check so that we weren't in a mad rush at the end, since it was very close to closing time. And that's really the main thing. We felt as though we were being rushed/kicked out. I'm not implying that their closing hours shouldn't be observed, but there are more polite ways to do it. A simple, ""we are closing and would appreciate it if you would finish up, please."" I don't feel that's asking a lot, but to each their own. 

Still, I would come back here and try out the rest of the menu. The items that our neighbors ordered at our table looked and smelled delicious. 

Enjoy!",1
"I don't know about what crowds people are talking about, as I went on a Thursday (after Sanur) at about 5 pm with a friend and there weren't many people there (the large upstairs room --which you pass en route to the bathroom--was closed).

The xiaolongbao is cheap! For 4-5 dollars (I forget the price) you get eight big soup dumplings, each with a lot of soup. I've had really good ones in Singapore, and though Joe's Shanghai could make the skin better to have the perfect texture, the xiaolongbao is nevertheless more than decent, and savory, and worthy to be eaten with delicate care. We carefully placed each xiaolongbao on the big porcelain  spoons we got (for fear that they would break, although they seemed decently strong), and the xiaolongbao was steaming hot! They were so big and had so much soup that I spent about several minutes eating each one, each one an intense experience..

But as a Singaporean, I think what the dish really needs is minced ginger -- they give you such thin shreds of ginger in soy sauce.",1
"This place had lines at 2:30 in the afternoon. It is cash only and you sit in communal tables. There is no ambiance whatsoever, it's not for a romantic date but if you want excellent pork soup dumpling then this is the place. We also ordered the shrimp noodle soup that had a really good flavor but the scallion pancake was a let down. I forgot to mention that this place have very inexpensive food for NY standards. The service is fast but don't expect friendly. There is only one bathroom each for men and women and it is not very nice but you don't come here for nice bathrooms or ambience. You can definitely believe the hype.",1
"Firstly, I don't know anything about authentic Chinese cuisine. But this place was packed and unbelievably delicious. I'd come back again and again if I lived in Nyc.",1
Fantastic spot. The soup dumplings are incredible. I could eat them forever. Super good. Go,1
"Classic soup buns, family style.  Joe's is the quintessential Chinatown restaurant that is always reliable in service and quality.  Be prepared for a wait especially with a large party.",1
"TLDR: It's a great sit down for families w great portions! The wait is a tad long& it's cash only!

-Taste: I know Joe's are notorious for the soup dumplings, but I was craving more plates. The Mapo tofu and the eggplant were flavorful to my liking and plus is Veg. Friendly
-Portion size: They are pretty generous with their plates. 3 plates can feed about 3-5 people!
-Price: Each plate was about $13, which is reasonable for much food they give you
-Service: It is definitely easier if you come with a native speaker, but the staff are kind and check to see if you need assistance quite often
-Ambiance: It's pretty spacious for a Chinatown sit down but a bit loud inside
-Return: Yes! But I would say you get more of your buck with a bigger group to try a little bit of everything on the menu.",1
Walking hangry around chinatown i stumbled upon this hidden gem and from that time i dream of their soup dumplings which are by far the best i had,1
"Ahhh, Joe Shanghai. How I love you. Although every time I visit I forget that you're tucked away on Pell Street and inconveniently almost completely on the east edge of the island, when I arrive you never disappoint. Of course I'm not the first to write about your heavenly soup dumplings, but I will indulge the details of my own experience: I love the first bite that scalds my tongue, the delicious pork nugget that sits inside you like a pearl at the bottom of your floppy soup-filled pouch, the spiked tongs that i use to pluck you from your bamboo and lettuce lined palace, and the taste of the warm broth rushing into my mouth through the small chopstick size tunnel i poked in you. Yum.",1
Went there last night upon recommendation from a local! Very good chicken fried rice and General Tso's chicken. Nothing fancy about service but turnover is the game and they get 'em in & get 'em out!!! Well worth the visit!!!,1
"I've been going to Joe's for nearly a decade now. The new location has completely lost all charm that the old one had, but it certainly felt cleaner. I feel as if the food's quality isn't a good as it used to be (minus the dumplings.) I also found it sad they didn't give free tea anymore. However there is no better soup dumpling spot in the entire country compared to Joe's! They nail it every time.",1
Crab soup dumplings. They're as good as everyone says. Definitely a must if you are in NYC.,1
"Great place for amazing dumplings, chinese food and then some. 

You won't come here for the atmosphere, it's typically packed, and not decorated to please the eye. But you'll quickly forget when you have a mouthful of amazing dumplings and enough broccoli beef to feed you and the person next to you. Seven of us went, and ordered enough to feed 9. We walked out with only $15 each including tip. Well worth it. 

Recommended: Dumplings (they're a must). Broccoli beef, General Tso's chicken",1
"Their pork buns taste so good!! I bought my mom here to eat it. I also got the pan fried noodles with beef and it tasted really good. 

I highly recommend this place.

This review is pretty short but this place is so tasty.",1
"Hard to order, but once you get a hang of it, food is really good! Be sure to order the dumpling soup. Couldn't understand what the waiter was asking me, but got help from others at the table. Good food and a good friendly time.",1
"This place gets packed and for good reasons. The dumpling was soo good. The broth inside is the best part. We also got egg fried rice, which was the best i've had in a while. We ordered i think scallion pancake is what it was called, the sauce it came with was perfect.",1
"Small line when we got there but only about 15 minute wait.  Food was excellent.  Enjoyed Dumplings with 3 sauces, Sesame Chicken, and Shrimp Fried Rice.  Yum!",1
the wait is really long but the food is pretty authentic. the dim sums are very good. the vegetable dished could be better.,1
"Place is not bad, service is average, food is pretty good. Place is sort of a hole in the wall, but the prices are priced accordingly by Chris Fasullo",1
"Fantastic soup dumplings, and also super cheap! But I wasn't the one who hung around for two hours when we put our name down lol. It's a LITTLE faster if you have a small group, but still, the crowd was outrageous, like an auction with people yelling out numbers!

On to the food. 

$6 for 8 pork dumplings. $7 for 8 seafood dumplings! The skin is thicker than I'm used to but still so good. And these were probably the hottest (Temp wise) that I've had.

The pan fried seafood noodles was delicious! Love pan fried chewy noodles. 

Scallion pancakes were a little burnt and kind of too oily for my taste.

Kung pao chicken was made with white meat? Haha, it was alright still

Shrimp fried rice was yum!

Be prepared to possibly share communal tables and be super cramped. Also. Cash only!",1
"TL;DR

1. Large portions
2. Fresh everything 
3. Accurate wait times 
4. Cash only 

Came here on a busy Friday night around 8pm, waited 45min for a party of 2, and it was on the dot accurate. Was seated with water by 845.

Ordered the regular pork, and pork + crab soup dumplings, garlic eggplant, hot and spurt soup, and sesame chicken.

Eggplant is always a good choice.
Chicken was great, but pricey.
Soup was amazing.

See you soon, Joe's Shanghai",1
"I love Joe Shanghai's. If you go here and don't get the soup dumplings you are doing it all wrong! They also have some dim sum options but not a larger selection, again you go here for their soup dumplings. For anyone wondering how to eat them, use the spoon to place the dumpling on so you don't lose the soup inside! 

Their beef or chicken rice cake dish is also delicious. Veggies tend to run up to $13 which is a lot if you are just a party of two, but I would get the snow pea/bean leaf or Chinese watercress! Nom nom!",1
"Wanted a quick lunch but ended up waiting over 1 1/2 hr for a table.  Since this place was recommended, we wanted to give it a try.  We were very hungry by the time we got to eat.  We ordered Crab & Pork Soup dumplings, Eggplant w/ Spicy Sauce, Spicy Szechuan Style Fish Fillet, Turnip Cake, Singapore Chow Mei fun and other dishes I can't remember. All the food was good but not sure if waiting that long is worth it when there are so many other restaurants in China town we could've tried.",1
"A group of 3 of us walked in at around 6 PM on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. I guess we got lucky because right after that a couple other groups came in and then there was a line. We sat in those two large communal round tables in the back. 

The scallion pancakes (2.95) are good and also a small portion (reflected upon by the cheap price). 
The xiao long bao (8 pieces, comes with steamed lettuce and vinegar sauce) was delicious! My first time having soup dumplings so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I thought the soup inside was very flavorful and the meat was tender and the dough that makes the dumpling was slightly chewy which I loved. 

We also ordered the Shanghai noodles and a beef/green bean dish. The shanghai noodles were probably the biggest disappointment. It wasn't anything crazy and the noodles were very greasy. Good nevertheless. The beef/green bean dish was great! Couldn't stop eating the green beans. 

Service is friendly than I would have expected. They do clear the plates as soon as you finish your food. Alcohol is served very quickly. Tsing tao 5.50 was a common beer that everyone else in the table ordered. A 15% tip is already included in your bill. 

Now I'm off to try other places that aren't so hyped to see if the xiao long bao at Joe's really is worth the hype!",1
"SOUPY  BUNS!!!!! Say it out loud. So delicious.
Cheap and the wait staff was hilariously nice.
Moo Shu was good not the best but good.
Greasy chinese is great  most likely anwhere but, I would stick with thedumplings here.",1
"Came here to see what all the rave was about their pork soup dumplings. This wasn't the first time that I encountered soup dumplings either so I did have something to compare to their food. I gotta say, the soup dumplings are actually very very delicious! The dough on the outside was moist and not hard so it was easy to bite into the dumplings. The soup was sweet and the pork was just the perfect compliment. The group I came with couldn't get enough so we ended up just ordering more. 

I would definitely recommend this place for the food, I don't know about the atmosphere. We weren't expecting to get seated with people we didn't know even though we had a large party but it got less awkward after awhile so it wasn't too bad. 

This is obviously Chinatown so of course it's going to be cash only so be prepared for that. On the bright side, the pork soup dumplings here are probably going to be the best for the cheapest price also. Eight for 5.95!",1
Great food and good find. A bit tight on the inside...,1
Went to Chinatown and stopped by this restaurant for lunch the last time I visited NYC! The wait was 20 minutes during lunch time but it's worth it! The food was delicious especially the dumplings! Huge portions and not expensive! Great restaurant for families too!,1
"Been here multiple times. The quality of the pork dumplings never falters. They are consistently delicious, and are presented to you pretty much as soon as you sit down. It is assumed you want them. I have been exploring the menu over the course of my visits and have some favorites: the fried rice cake with seafood is classic and delicious. Fried crispy whole sea bass, though a task to eat, is very yummy. The sauteed winter vegetables are delicate and refreshing. Try to get here between 5-6:30 so you have only a 10-20 minute wait. Service is quick and there is only about a 5 minute wait for your food.",1
Soup dumplings were good. I loved the pork fried buns. The General Tso's was very fresh but I was disappointed that it didn't come with any rice or noodles. Others with me had the Lo mein and fried rice and said they were very good as well.,1
"This place was crazy busy when we came in. Of course we weren't surprised, it was definitely a tourist spot within Chinatown. We had a party of 4 and waited about 30 minutes. It's kind of communal sitting, where they fill up any empty seat they have at their many tables. For example, we had maybe 3 separate parties at our table. 

Service was not the best, but I was very impressed with their efficiency, considering the sheer amount of customers AND workers there. They seem very disorganized but they have their own system that definitely works. You don't have just one waiter, but multiple can come up at a time to help. It's very loud inside so maybe not the best place for a first date!

We ordered 2 orders of pork xiao long bao and they were really good!!! They looked pretty messy but you can't deny their taste! We also ordered hot and sour soup, beef and broccoli, and some seafood dish I can't remember. Everything was just really good typical Chinese food!! Although the hot and sour soup had these chunks of chicken (I think) in which I did not care for. They were too tough. 

The place wasn't the cleanest either, but then again, with the amount of traffic coming in and out I don't blame them. They do what they can and you can tell they would much rather get customers in and out than spend their time making sure the restaurant is presentable. Maybe other locations aren't quite as crowded, so if I visit NYC again I'll definitely pay them a visit!

Also they are cash only!!!",1
"They make one of the best soup dumpling I ever had! It is soooo good. However, I always need to share the table but the taste totally make sharing the table worth it. I usually don't go during rush hour so I never had to wait long. The price is reasonable and location is convenient.",1
"This place gets PACKED! This is my 2nd visit. First visit, we had to wait for about 40 minutes to be seated at this BIG table shared with a few other parties. I have to say, it was brutal to see other people at your table with their food while you wait for yours. 

My 2nd time there, no wait (lucky us!!). It was on a Tuesday night, but the place was still filled! The workers know people go there for the dumplings, so before we even sat our butts down, the waiter already asked how many orders of dumplings. Personally I thought it was kinda rude but if I guess I wouldn't mind if I was SUPER hungry and ready to chow!

The two of us got an order of the dumplings, Shanghai noodle and a shrimp noodle soup. Everything was delicious. The trick to eat the dumpling is to eat the top first, suck the juice inside, then eat the whole thing. Both times, I had very good experience with the service and the food. I'd go there again :)",1
"Soup Dumplings :) If you want more authentic Chinese food(shanghainese), try this.",1
Crab dumpling is very good same with the chefs special prawns.. Hong Kong style noodles are good too..,1
"The first time someone brought me here, we were on a third date. I was suspicious. Suspicious that he had been too lazy to make reservations at a restaurant that takes reservations, mostly, but also suspicious that this wonderful thing he was referring to as a soup dumpling, something I had never heard of before, was really just wonton soup.

8 Pork Steamed Buns later, I was a wholly changed individual. JS soup dumplings have since become one of my favorite things to eat, right up there with everything else that poses a potential mess-problem and is sort of unhealthy. I have even expanded my preferred terms of endearment (Sweetie, Honey, Babe) to include ""Joe's Shanghai Soup Dumpling"". It doesn't get much more loving than that.  

The menu is rather extensive, perhaps too extensive for thorough familiarity. Everything I have had here has been good (scallion pancake) or great (try the noodle soups), but you will see from looking around at other tables that the soup dumplings (pork or crabmeat/pork - I prefer the pork) are definitely the go-to items. 

The two issues that I have with Joe's Shanghai: They do not deliver and they do not take reservations. Almost always at capacity, you will be forced to wait between twenty and forty minutes to be seated. Where do you wait? Outside. This is all fine and dandy during the summer but during the colder months? Not so fine, not so dandy.

Side note: Once inside, you may or may not be seated at a table full of strangers. Best not to come here if you need alone or one-on-one time.",1
Hands down the most delicious soup dumplings that you'll ever put in your mouth. This is the place to go for soup dumplings. They own them in New York. Get like four baskets.,1
"Jewish Christmas@ Joe's:

Fan-f*ckingtastic.

Yes, there was an hour an a half wait. It was worth every minute.

We had:

1. FOUR orders of crab and pork dumplings. 
2. TWO orders of General Tso's Chicken
3. TWO orders Jumbo Prawns with Meat Sauces.
4. Beef with Scallions
5. Twice-cooked Pork
6. Orange Beef
7. Some noodles (enhanced with pork, of course). Don't remember the exact kind, but they were fantastic.

Oh yeah, and a partridge in a freakin' Shanghai-nese pear tree. 

BADASS.

Kill me. Kill yourself. Kill everyone you know.

NEXT YEAR, BITCHES.",1
"Tips: 
-Come early!! The restaurant may be open, but they do not start taking orders until 11am. I arrived at 10:45am, and there was already 2 tables ""reserved"" by 2 customers sitting there. Even if all members of your party arrive before 11am, orders are not taken till 11am. By 11:20am, the entire place was jam-packed! 

-This may be common sense haha but order the soup dumplings (8 per order). The first time the waiter asks is if you want soup dumplings. All other food items are comparable to 500 other restaurants in Chinatown. However the soup dumplings... oh my lord, are one of a kind!

-I prefer the crab soup dumplings to the pork. I was surprised at the amount of crab in each dumpling. The crab flavor is very prominent in both filling and soup. 

-Eat it while its hot!! The dumplings are not as good as it cools to room temp. 

Dislikes:
- Cash only $ 
- 15% involuntary gratuity/service charge 

Best soup dumplings I have ever had? Yes, in my life thus far.
Is it worth the hype? Well....  I do not think its worth the wait if its more than 30 minutes.",1
"I had one of my favorite dishes of 2008 here:  

Steamed Buffalo Carp Fish Belly.

OH.  MY.  GOD.  SWEET.  JESUS.  MAMA.  SATAN.

_C$",1
"Gotta hand it to Joe's - best soup dumplings ever.
Get the pork soup dumplings only - the rest of the menu is too greasy and average at best. I personally don't like the crab and pork - I feel the fishiness of the crab is unnecessary and doesn't pair well with the savory pork. 

The pork filling is juicy and full of flavor - I haven't found another shop that makes their XLBs with as much soup filling as Joe's - superb.

The skin is also extremely well made - not doughy or thick but cooked to a perfect chewy texture and thin - definitely hand made.

The wait is horrible as expected - you might have a better chance on a random early Monday or Tues night - prime dinner time and weekends you're looking at at least an hour wait. Here's a secret though if you're not looking to wait but still want to try the famous soup dumplings - go down the street (a few steps) to Joe's Ginger (owner is the same) and so are the soup dumplings.

It's a cleaner set up and they charge slightly higher prices for the same food but it's a great option to get the same food with less wait.

Service is the same at both places - non existent and rushed. You'll most likely share tables here as well unless you have a large group. Cash only and they automatically add on 15% tip - which I don't mind since it's the standard and the food is pretty cheap already.",1
"This place was the shit, good as fuck. The Zsechuan beef cacerole was  really good, big, and flavory. I also liked the shrimp and chicken in plum sauce. I ve tried several chinese joints here in Chinatown and of all, this hits home run. I loved the price/serving size ratio and the quality of the food is just so freakin good",1
"Yummy......their specialty here seems to be their juicy dumplings. Be sure to eat them while they are piping hot because the juices once cold will revert back to its gelatinous state (pure lard)

We also had their Spinach with a touch of garlic, General Tso's chicken, and their Scallion pancake as an appetizer. All these dishes were delightful. No wonder this place is so popular with all the locals.

Be forewarned, they only accept cash. Also, space is scarce. You might have to sit with a another group of people at the same table.",1
i love  wearing  nice  warm  furry  hood  parkas  coats  nice  & warm  in  the  winter  time,1
"Best soup dumplings in New York, or so they say.  They are definitely among the best I've had.  For the bite sized awesomeness these piping hot soup bags deliver to your taste buds, the rest of the menu could go unnoticed, but actually most of the dishes here are also very good.  Try the pork belly or a vegetable dish as a side.",1
"Joe's Shanghai was hands down the best soup dumpling I've ever had. The dumpling skin is thicker than what I am used to at DTF but there was so much more soup in the dumplings.
During Covid at this location they have two tables outside but it looked like most people were ordering to go.",1
"Delicious pork dumplings! Service was a little slow, CASH only, table was a little bit sticky, but the food made up for it. It was delicious! Try the fried rice cakes, different and very tasty!",1
"Wow this place is Xiao long bao heaven.

Crab & pork soup dumplings - 5/5. Best I've had in the US, hands down. Lots of delicious soup in a thin wrapper. Only complaint/wish is that the dumplings are hugeee so I wish the spoons were also bigger as it was impossible to not spill the liquid gold (aka soup). 

Beef lo mein - 3/5. Nothing exciting. It was fine. Perfectly average. Probably the smallest portion of lo mein I've ever gotten though from a non-Americanized/fusion place. 

Looking around, the portions are ""normal"" and not oversized like you'd expect from a Chinese place. But it's to be expected given how mainstream this place is, and is now in a nice looking / not hole in the wall looking place. Outside of the soup dumplings, everything is mediocre and overpriced (relative to the small portions) and nothing too special. I wouldn't come here for anything else. But I will be coming back again and again for those soup dumplings!!",1
"Cheers to SOUP DUMPLING!!!!

But what sucks is you have to share your table with strangers and there's too many damn tourists!

LONG WAIT!!!!!",1
soup dumplings are good especially for the price but they're just decent with no huge wow factor. definitely a solid choice if you want something cheap and filling though (also great for groups),1
Love this place so much. You may have to wait over an hour for a table but it's worth it. Best soup dumplings in the city! The entrees are all excellent. It's one of my go-to places to take people from out of town.,1
"Down, maybe a little out but NYC remains a helluva restaurant town. Joe's Shanghai is amazing... go for the Hong Kong style Hot and Sour soup and stay for the Crispy Beef. Two personal favorites but you could throw a dart at the menu and still be gobsmacked. An easy five stars.",1
"YASSS SOUP DUMPLINGS! 
Okay, story time: 
I'm in New York for the FIRST time- and only there for 10 hours before I head back to Baltimore. I have a train to catch at 11:05 from Penn Station. I'm near Central Park so I take a train and jog walk like half a mile to Joe's Shanghai. Got there around 10 and sat next to other people and ordered 2 types of soup dumplings. We literally scarfed them down because of time crunch but also because they were SOOO good. 

I think coming from LA where I've only tried soup dumplings at Din Tai Fung (don't judge me pls) coming to Joe's Shanghai was a game changer. I'd be here all the time if I was in New York. Please go and try",1
"Joe's Shanghai has a reputation for being one of the Chinatown eateries that you have to visit.  One thing to note, Shanghainese dishes are a little different from other Chinese dishes, which is why eating at Joe's is such a treat.  The two more popular dishes are the xiao long bao and the Shagnhainese style fried noodles.  I could stuff myself with both of those all day.  Some of the other cold appetizers aren't bad either, I'd say order one or two dishes, say the chicken, jellyfish, or beef, just to try them out.  While you could order some of these dishes at other restaurants, this is the spot in Manhattan where they are the most authentic.",1
"Great place for a cheap yummy date! Though, maybe I got a bad batch of soup dumplings, but they were really disappointing. 

   But, the crispy beef was wonderful!! I'd definitely come back for that!

There's not much else I can say that hasn't been said. But maybe I need to come back with a true soup dumpling expert, anyone want to provide the guidance?",1
"Great soup dumplings!!! Everything else other people ordered looked / smelled so good too! I definitely think the pork and shrimp dumplings are too heavy on the pork, didn't get much shrimp out of it.",1
"Everyone know Joe Shanghai by now and I probably won't add much to what's been written.  I will say that I still think it's better than Ding Tai Fong in LA.  The soupiness of the dumplings is just..perfect.

Here's what we ate:
1. Pork and crab dumplings - For the record, I think that the pork dumplings are almost just as good as the ones with crab and the crab ones are 50% more expensive.  I can go ghetto and just stick to the pork ones.

2. Sliced braised beef noodle soup with vermicelli  - The beef is amazing but the soup and noodles are only average.  It's a little spicy which makes it better.

3. Scallion pancake - a staple and still very good - crispy and tasty.

4. Vegetarian duck - So good and stuffed with mushrooms.  I'll order this every time.

5. Shanghai fried flat noodle - Some people apparently love this but I think it's terrible and a waste of stomach space - especially when you could be getting in an extra 3 or 4 of those dumplings. 

6. Braised Pork shoulder - My greatest find!  My cousin saw some other table order it during a different visit and wanted to try it.  I had never had it before.  Boy, was I missing out.  It's a massive piece of fatty pork marinaded.  It is absolutely amazing although two of these would probably be an instant heart attack.  We were a party of 7 and didn't really eat the entire thing.  I would not recommend ordering this with anything less than that number of people in your party.  That just means that you must go to Joe Shanghai with at least 7 people because it's a MUST-ORDER.

I love this place and despite the wait, it's still worth it to me.  Go Joe!",1
"Great soup dumplings! We loved the pork and crab, and we went for a late lunch so no lines at all and service was actually really nice (especially compared to what we had read in reviews). Cheap, good, and would go again! 

Cash only.",1
"Super popular,
If you go during dinner  expect to wait at least 30 minutes. Space Inside is pretty small. If you go with a small party you will most likely get placed at a big table with others. Alsoooo order the soup dumplings (crab but also pork).",1
"YES. Best XLB I've had so far and that's comparing it to places in the Bay Area, California. Huge pieces that are all consistently filled with soup. And the prices are so reasonable. $6/8 pork, $7 or $8 for 8 crab/pork. I'll definitely be back here for more",1
"hands down...the best soup dumplings. the rest of the chinese food was ok....
but eat loads of these delicious soup dumplings!!!",1
"Joe's is one of the more famous restaurants known for their Xiao Long Bao (Steamed Pork Buns, the ones with the soup inside the dumpling).  

In California, most of the Xiao Long Bao's I've tried have been pitiful at best.  Usually, the moisture has left the dumpling by the time it has hit the table.

At Joe's, I believe everyone of the Pork ones had soup in it.  Tasted good.  Unfortunately, the Crab & Pork ones had a few deflated ones. 

The Subgum Fried Rice Cake was cooked very nicely and was very tasty.  Lion's Head (meatballs) were tasty, but had a texture and dryness I didn't care for.

The things that didn't do it for me here:

- most of the tables are for large parties, so you'll end up sharing a table with strangers

- CASH ONLY

- automatic $15% service charge

I would include service, but who expects good service at a Chinese place?",1
"Been here three times and it definitely hits the spot.  Not anything fancy and you will most likely have to share a table with strangers, but it's good stuff.  Get the dumplings, they are piping hot and delish.  Had the orange chicken or beef, can't remember which, but it was goooooood.  We order a ton of food when we go and finish everything.  And sometimes, order seconds of the fried rice!",1
i dream about their soup dumplings.  i get two orders for myself (for real)... sometimes it scares people.,1
"Best soup dumplings I've ever had. The restaurant is family style, so your party shares a table with other people. It sometimes takes a while to be seated, but service is fast once you do sit down. It's best to know what you want to order by the time your server gets to you for the first time -- the place has a busy, chaotic vibe.",1
"The soup dumplings here are on point. The broth is nice and rich with pork fat. The pork inside the dumplings are decent and the dumpling skin is to chewy. Service is okay. You can't have high expectations for a Chinese restaurant that has high volume of traffic. Definitely, worth a try",1
Great food! Love the soup dumplings! We had to wait for a bit but was totally worth it! The service was great and the staff was very helpful.,1
"Lunch time, party of 2....no wait! I checked reviews before and saw that it was a cash only establishment. They do have atm's up front....and if you are worried about a service charge, it is probably time to change your bank. 

We picked the crab meat and pork soup dumplings and then asked the server for a recommendation. He pointed out the crispy shredded beef. 

The dumplings arrived first and they were sooooooo good. It's hard to wait for them to cool down, but that broth can be painful if you start in too quickly. The filling was delicious and the broth was rich and delicious. I was surprised by the crispy shredded beef. It was completely different than I had imagined. It seemed similar to orange chicken, but with strips of beef. It was sweet and crispy and paired well with the white rice. This was a lot of food for a party of 2....sadly we couldn't take it with us, so we made sure to finish the dumplings.

This place is busy, lots of tables but everything seemed to come out quickly.",1
Soup dumplings were on point! Really fresh and delicious! The rest of the food was average. It's mighty packed and you'll have to make up your mind quick or wait a bit.,1
"Quick in and out. Very attentive service, we only had the crab soup dumplings, pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes, but all three were delicious. We will be back to Chinatown to hit this place and tiger sugar, for boba, just around the corner.",1
"The service is like the service at any other place in Chinatown - not good.  But the food is great!  Definitely come with a group, so you can eat family style and sample a little of everything.

Joe Shanghai is not as vegetarian friendly as other Chinese restaurants, but it's still good.  My friends and I ordered some fried noodles with vegetables, an eggplant dish without the pork, turnip cakes, veggie duck, and soup dumplings (no vegetarian option here).

The only dish I wouldn't recommend was the veggie duck.  We ordered it based on a favorable review that was hanging on the window outside.  Definitely could have passed on that one.  Everything else was delicious, and the sauces for the noodles and eggplant were super tasty.  A little oily, but dude, it's Chinese food.

Man, writing about this is making me hungry.",1
"Hidden in a small alley in Chinatown, I wasn't sure what to expect. But before I knew it I was gobbling these succulent dumplings, filled with steaming broth and a crab meatball. And oh my gosh, so juicy and ahh... And so cheap!!! It was only about $5 for 8 or so dumplings, and they can fill you up fast!! Warning, warning, this place gets packed!! So prepare to be sitted in a squishy environment, but it will be all worth it. =)",1
"The whole experience of Joe's Shanghai is what you look for in Chinatown.  While waiting for a table, I wanted to cool down and went next door to Quickly for a Thai Tea.  The whole process was pretty streamlined and didn't take that long considering how many people were standing outside.  

I wanted so many things on the menu but couldn't resist the soup dumplings and, just for a little variety, I also got the scallion pancake.  Not only was the food remarkable, I loved sitting at community tables.  The diverse group at my table were sharing food just by spinning the lazy-suzan at the center of the table.",1
"During my most recent visit here, we rolled up at noon and there was NO wait surprisingly. We walked right in and got seated immediately. We must have just beaten the lunch crowd that day. 

Tip: This no-wait occurrence is rare so expect a wait at all other times because JS is usually always packed.

JS isn't a place you go to for dim sum, but rather authentic Shanghainese dishes, and their infamous soup dumplings (xiao long bao) which are a must and probably the sole reason why JS attracts herds of people. Their soup dumplings are a mix of crab and pork dumplings so for you vegetarian or non-pork eating folks, this wouldn't be the ideal dish for you. Unfortunately, they don't make exceptions. 

Tip: I highly recommend poking a small hole with your chopstick at the top of each dumpling to let out some of the steam to prevent yourself from burning your precious taste buds. You will need them to fully indulge in these crafty, one-of-a-kind, skillfully handmade dumplings. Use your soup spoon to sip and savor the remaining ""liquid explosions"" that gush out of each dumpling.

Another surprising treat at JS are their scallion pancakes. They are super crunchy, yet so moist and boasting with unimaginable flavors on the inside. They are quite addictive. Don't be surprised if you tack on one more order of them to your bill.

Other must-orders/haves:
- young chow fried rice
- roast duck
- watercress

The service here is always on point so actual chow time is never interrupted.

Other tips:
- Since the demand is high and crowds are rampant, get in and get out is common courtesy. Don't linger longer than you need to. There are hungry people waiting in line to devour what you just stuffed in your happy belly.
- Expect a half hour to an hour wait.
- Since JS is a compact place, expect to be sharing tables with hungry, happy strangers. JS takes advantage of every seat option available.

I haven't had one bad dish here, and personally that's a great indication of a successful restaurant with satisfying food, and a bargain one at that. This is one of my favorite go-to spots in Chinatown.",1
"Ever since I was little my name was Xiao Long Bao and my favorite movie was Spiderman with the great Tobey. Ever since I watched part one I wanted to find the alley with the Chinese lady singing the original spiderman theme song, you know spiderman spiderman. I finally made my way there and was at a ah. While I was rolling around I ran into this restaurant and was like ohhh they sell my name here so I gotta try it. Omg life changing all I did was bite, blow, suck, and take it in whole. I fell in love doing it 8 times at a time with each tray I just couldn't stop. Thank you Tobey for leading me here.

Best Xiao Long Bao. The line is worth the wait.",1
"Joe's is the ONLY place I go to for soup dumplings (get the pork and crabmeat one, more flavoful). I did try soup dumplings elsewhere because some people kept insisting that joe's is not ""authentic"", and I was disppointed (as predicted). Maybe those other dumplings are the real deal, but WHO CARES, joe's tastes so much better!! Also, try their String Bean Szechuan Style (with Pork) - AMAZING, crispy, and flavorful with bits of yummy pork and pickled veggies. 

yes, the service is bad, but what do you expect - this is standard in chinatown, get over it! 

food can get a bit greasy and the wait is long (indicative of its yumminess!), but that doesnt deter me from bringing/recommending everyone i know to joe's...and i haven't heard one complaint yet.",1
"By far, the best Chinese food I have ever had in Chinatown. Thanks Yelp reviewers! The only sad part was that we stopped for lunch and not dinner. This is the only bean curd I have enjoyed. It was crispy and served in a rich (just spicy enough) brown sauce, loaded with mushrooms and veggies. The veggie LoMein was chock full of a variety of vegetables, not just noodles. The service is impeccable, and the restaurant clean and nicely decorated. We were greeted with hot cups of jasmine tea. The waiters were on standby so that no cup was left I filled, no request not immediately satisfied. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here.",1
"Yes, it's all been said before, but I will again anyway.

Love, love LOVE the soup dumplings!  Was taken here by friends for my first soup dumpling experience.  Fantastic taste and mix of textures and sensations - hot soup, dense pork filling, chewy dumpling and delicious sauce.  

The place is a mad-house, with fast-moving staff and a crush of diners.  Don't even try to figure out the waiting list.  It's like trigonometry or something.  Just happily accept a table, order some dumplings and some Tsingtao and start looking at the rest of the menu.  Seems hard to go wrong.

We had fantastic pea shoots - so sweet and tender, with a little garlic; beef and green beans; crispy noodles and vegetables; crispy prawns in meat sauce; and General Tsao's Chicken.  All were good, but I must say that the pea shoots and beef with green beans were my two faves.  But I definitely felt like all their food was prepared well and from very good ingredients.

This is totally on my must-stop list now when I'm in town.",1
"This was one of my favorite places to go when I lived in NYC and a fun place to take out-of-town guests...there just isn't quite an experience like this one!  When you get to Joe's you will most likely find a HUGE line outside the door.  You take a carnival ticket with a number on it from the girl inside and she continually shouts out numbers into the street.  When your lucky number is called, it is your turn to head inside.  Sometimes the line moves at a decent pace, but at other times, it takes way over an hour to be seated!  (PS, they don't really like it and aren't very helpful if you ask where you are on this list!)

If you don't like eating with a bunch of strangers, this probably isn't the place for you!  Most often you are sat at a large communal table with a bunch of strangers (unless your party is large enough to take up the entire table).  It can be fun if you are placed with the right people, but it can also be a bit awkward.  

As far as food goes, well, I LOVE their soup dumplings!  We usually order at least two trays of both the pork and the crab dumplings.  They are super flavorful but I'm not the most graceful when eating them...probably not a place you'd go to impress a date for the first time.  I also love to get their scallion pancakes for an appetizer.  For entrees, I usually end up sharing with the people I go with, but I can say their beef and broccoli and sesame chicken are pretty tasty (as well as their other dishes...I've just had these two most often).  

The waiters are extremely efficient and work like a well-oiled machine...they know how to turn the tables over quickly to ease that long line outside.  However, they are definitely not the most friendly and often forget to bring me my soda!  Definitely come here for the experience and some dumplings...but don't expect to get inside quickly or to receive friendly service (PS, they only take cash, so make sure you have some)",1
It's Joes. That's all you need to know. Get scallion pancakes. Aswell as everything else,1
Visiting from California !!! This is by far the best Chinese food restaurant!!! I'm pretty picky I was a little scared to try at first but once I went in and seen how busy they were I knew I was in the right place !... oh and there were nice enough to charge my phone thank you !!!!!,1
"Soup dumplings all the way.  Service isn't great, and you'll be sitting at a table with other people.  It's a bit eclectic, but that's why you go there.  If it's too crowded you're also right by Joe's Ginger which is basically the same exact thing.  Don't forget, cash only.  Did I mention the soup dumplings?",1
"Soup dumplings are to die for, their pancakes are pretty good. The crispy rice noodle was interesting, definitely a great flavor. But I can live on their dumplings . Service is always amazing",1
"soup dumplings are the famous dish here, and very cheap to boot.  If I lived closer, I would eat here far more often, and even go just as a snack.  I've tried multiple dishes here over the years (duck, fried rice, friend pork etc) and have not been disappointed.  

The restaurant adds Tip to the bill automatically, so be careful you don't double tip!  And it's Cash Only.

You are likely to have to share a table, and there's probably a crowd, so try going near off-peak times.",1
"The soup dumplings here are delicious. I'd say this is one of the best places to get soup dumplings in Chinatown, but the other foods on the menu aren't as worth it. I highly recommend you don't go during their rush hour, which starts around 7PM, because the wait becomes long and the service becomes poor. If you are going in a large group, make sure the majority or all of the people are there because this is one of those restaurants that will not seat you during the rush hour unless your entire party is there.",1
"Din Tai Fung in the LA area was my favorite place for xiao long bao until now.  Joe's Shanghai has awesome xiao long bao.  It's bigger, and because of that, the dumpling is way meatier tasting and super juicy.  Practically speaking, it's a little big for stuffing them in your face, but taste-wise they're awesome.  I also like that Joe's Shanghai has so many other dishes to eat that are also very tasty.

We had the orange beef (suprisingly awesome), sweet and sour fried yellow fish (very tasty), shanghai noodles (very tasty), sauteed mushrooms with bamboo shoots (tasty and flavorful), and green onion pancake (pretty standard, but very good).  I was totally stuffed for a mere $11.",1
"Pros: Shanghai Dumpling Buns
Cons: VERY hard to get a seat and they don't take reservations

Thoughts: This is one of the staple restaurants in NYC's Chinatown and has yet to be replaced. It's something about those dumplings that can't be duplicated. There isn't any other place that would make it as good, maybe Joe's Ginger a block down that's owned by the same people, but it's still not as great. I've tried finding a Shanghai Restaurant in other big cities and have yet to discover it. They have the regular ones and they have ones with crab in it. The trick is eating it without it squirting all over the place... luckily I think I've mastered it with all the times going there. This place is a must try... if you can wait for a seat. Oh, and their other Shanghai dishes are good as well, such as Drunken Chicken and Scallion Pancake.",1
"Soup dumplings were melt in your mouth savory.  Thick beef broth flavor is probably its selling point.  Delicious, but I'm a dumpling lover.",1
"Came here after reading copious amounts of stellar reviews on here, and I can say I wasn't disappointed!

Was with my fellow elite friend, isa and marco, and had the famous siu long bao. It was great. Other stuff we had included Tawainese noodles of some sort and another carby dish, reminiscent of gnocchi. Am not familiar with names. 

It was really really good, partly due to the novelty aspect. But the downside was that it was SALTY beyond any sort of belief! To the point where I couldn't get thru the following 3-4 hours because of the excess MSG. 

So yes, if they toned that down a notch, I'd be happy. Would still come back tho!",1
I love the soupy dumplings!!!!  I don't come to NYC that often but when I do this place is a must go every time!,1
"Yum! Best Chinese food ever! We ordered the soup dumplings, stir fried green beans, the Shanghai fried flat noodles and the chicken General Tso and I would recommend all these dishes, in that order. We had to wait 20mins to be seated but so worth it. By the time your seated and starved everything is delicious. The best dumplings I have ever tasted in my life and the green beans, oh... my mouth is watering as I type this review. I would come back again and again and take all my friends with me. It's a dingy little place in Chinatown but it makes the experience culturally authentic.Nothing to complain about, I just love this place!!!",1
I've been there with my girlfriend a few times now. I think it is a very approachable option for nicer/more authentic Asian food. Their soup dumplings are a must get. I've also had chicken with garlic sauce and some items off of their specials menu and they were all very good. Great food at an affordable price. Can be crowded sometimes so make a reservation if possible.,1
"What can I say that 450 reviews haven't said already?  I just came back from this place again recommended by a friend... Driving to Pell Street is kind of annoying because it is a small street and there is always traffic in that area... parking is a real pain if you are like me and refuse just to put it in a lot, but otherwise taking the train would be ideal...

Here I am on a rainy day, super cozy and hungry and than it happens I spot the line to get in Joe's... I go up to the hostess for a table and she tells me 10 minutes... but as I walked in that door the smell of food i would soon be devouring consumed me... this wasn;t any old chinese take out food... this is Joe's... this is one of those great feelings you don't expect like on a hot night flipping the pillow and than laying back down on the cold side of the pillow... that's what this place is like!!

I sometimes expect the chinese food in Chinatown to be cheaper, I am not sure why, but it is always the opposite and it always pisses me off... everytime. But my god $4.65 for those giant melt in your mouth pork dumplings I had yesterday.. I will take it... um and by that I mean one order everyday of my life.. oh my and the seafood, and any type of noodle... Basically, what it all boils down to is if you like have a favorite local chinese food restaurant do not come here, you will be ruined, spoiled for life and forever addicted to Joe's...",1
"The most amazing soup dumplings and scallion pancakes you will ever taste. There is typically a line, but it moves very fast. Communal seating, extremely affordable, cash only. This place is the best!!!",1
"If you're coming here, then you know what the deal is. It's all about the soup dumplings, and they are delicious--even moreso on a cold winter's day. I can't speak for the pork version, but the crab soup dumplings were delightful. The dumpling skin was perfect from textural standpoint. The fillings were flavor-packed, juicy, and tender. And to be honest, they're just plain fun to eat. Why have a dumpling and a bowl of soup on the side when you can fuse both together into a Megazord of scrumptiousness? 

For the sake of full disclosure, I can't give this place a perfect rating because the other items I tried were not anything to write home about as far as being memorable. They were pretty good but not great. This is where you come to get soup dumplings. The other Chinese offerings can be found with equal or better taste in other NY restaurants and particularly in Queens--a gem for East Asian cuisine.",1
"I dont know about ya'll.. but this place freaking nailed with those soup dumplings. I've tried some soup dumplings from other franchises too, but J Shangai make the best ones.",1
"This place is awesome! I enjoyed the crab and pork soup dumplings, crispy beef and broccoli noodles, and crispy duck! I came here late on a Monday night and the place was packed (which is a good sign) This place takes cash only! 
Everything was delicious! I would love to return to try other things!",1
"This place was legit old school chinese restaurant.  Located in a seedy wet alley looking street which seems as if one will be getting into a kung fu fight coming out of the restaurant just as on the old kung fu movies. 

I had the Shanghai noodles and pork dumplings...ate the entire plate of noodles and about 6 dumplings.  So delicious. 

Authentic chinese cuisine.",1
"Joe's Soup Dumplings ($5.50-6.50) are what made the place famous, and they're hard to resist. The grimy atmosphere might make you leave our monocles at home, but so long as Joe's keeps making delicious, cheap dumplings, I'll be coming back whenever I'm back in NY.",1
"This place is very nice! I love their soup dumplings. I've been twice so far, and both times have ordered the soup dumplings. The service was very nice, quick, and polite. I also highly recommend the orange chicken! It is delicious! It does get crowded at peak hours, so I would recommend going earlier if you do not want to wait.",1
"Can't go wrong with the food here, all around amazing food. Keep spoon feeding me that MSG please. Your service is going to be awful but small price to pay for great food.",1
"BEST dumplings! Thought this might be a tourist trap but we do not have anything close to this in LA. The dumplings were so juicy and the and the skin was thicker than other places. We also tried the Chinese pancake, string beans, noodles, and some other items but the dumplings definitely overshadowed all the other dishes.
Definite must try when in NYC",1
So so happy I ran into this place.... everything was amazing and plan on going here up until the day I fly out! So delicious!! Organic and local!,1
"The best dumplings!  Place that little dumpling in your soup spoon, break the dumpling skin so that the juices flow out into your spoon, and place in your mouth ... Mmmmm, heavenly ...",1
"3.5 Stars

Some of the dishes at Joe's Shanghai are pretty good and others I would get somewhere else. I liked the minced chicken corn soup, it was a very simple blend of corn kernels,",1
"My bf and I have had our fair share of XLBs and scallion pancakes back home. We heard about Joe's Shanghai and had to check it out during our trip in NY. The interior is quite nice, clean, and updated. Luckily it wasn't too busy so we were seated immediately. We ordered the crab and pork XLB and the scallion pancakes. The XLB came in a set of 8 and were pretty large. The outer skin was soft and the soup inside was thick, savory, and tasty. There was a good amount of crab/pork filling and surprisingly, I tasted a lot of the crab meat/flavor. The XLB was AMAZING! The scallion pancakes had a thick consistency, crispy on the outside and slightly chewy inside. Perfect scallion flavor and tasted really good with the side of vinegar sauce provided. This place is cash only and there are ATMs right by their front door. Definitely worth the hassle to pull out some cash!!!",1
"Absolutely love this place. My favorite place to get shanghai buns is from Joe's shanghai! It is so delicious, once you've tried it, you'll be looking forward to the next time you'll be able to get your hands on some more. If you've never tried it, better get it to it then! My favorite way to enjoy my shanghai buns is to open up a small hole on top and drizzle a little bit of the sauce they give then when it's at the perfect temperature, stuff the whole thing in my mouth, doing it like this, you have the juices pouring out to keep the bun moist as you chew. *drool*",1
fantastic ghetto chinese food.  crushes every chinese place i've tried in the city not in chinatown.  communal seating isn't a highlight but kind of interesting.  only complaint is that they don't deliver to gramercy.,1
Once you've had Joe Shanghai dumplings...your life will never be the same again. It's a must try for any Asian food enthusiast.,1
"This was suggested not once, but twice by folks I knew. I went in during a weekday and I managed to find it not as crowded as I was originally concerned. Especially being one person they accommodated me and knew immediately what I wanted to try. The Xiao Long Bao I had was Pork. The soup was fatty and delicious and really warmed me up. 

The issue I had was that the skin wasn't well put together and some did burst upon handling it but no worries, I managed to scrap up every bit of soup I could find. Still a solid choice but it's not there as my favorite soup dumplings, but I will come back and try again.",1
Whole in the wall spot but best soup dumplings there are. Tips- you do sit in a communal table so that could get weird. Also cash only.,1
Delicious soup dumplings!! Also had the sautéed bok choy which was amazing and a scallion pancake. Would def come again. Cash only.,1
"Soup dumplings heaven another very hyped restaurant, their new location give you a lil more elbow room while dining compared to its old location. Cash only is the only draw back, no one carries cash nowadays!",1
"I was mad about the wait time, but it's so worth it. We ordered the crab meat with pork soup dumplings, Chilean sea bass, and the house special glazed crispy chicken. The chicken was delicious, of course. But that might've been the best sea bass (from a Chinese restaurant) that I've ever had. So moist and tender, but still held its integrity. And of course, my absolute favorite was the dumpling! I wish I ordered more but I didn't want to overdo it. Honestly, I can't even describe the dumpling. You just have to try it for yourself.",1
Well worth the wait! Best Chinese food I've had in a long time. The dumplings are to die for!! I can't wait to return to NYC! Chinatown was one of my favorite places!,1
"I liked dining here. Soup dumplings came first then around time we finished dumplings, noodle came out. I like eating crispy noodles and husband likes to drench then in sauce before eating them.

Service was fast. I'd like to return to try different menus!",1
"The food was sooooooo goood. Absolutely amazing definitely my favorite Asian restaurant in all of New York. We ordered the sesame chicken, general tso chicken, Mongolian beef, fried rice and the lo mein. Everything was perfect. Another thing is they only accept cash.",1
"CASH ONLY! They have ATMs on site if needed.

I came with four friends for a Sunday evening dinner. You have to have the whole party there to get seated, and they'll give you a ticket number and ask for contact information.

Food: We ordered the crispy shrimp pan fried noodles, pan fried dumplings, scallion pancakes, beef and broccoli, pork soup dumplings, and crab and pork soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were really good, I usually prefer crab soup dumplings, but I liked the pork soup dumplings here better (but both were very good!). The scallion pancakes and pan fried pork dumplings were also very yummy and cooked well with a nice crisp on the outside. The beef and broccoli was also nice and flavorful, and the beef was tender, but I did expect a bigger portion than what we got. The pan fried noodles were okay, there wasn't a ton of flavor and the water chestnuts and corn had a strong canned flavor. I probably would order everything again except for the pan fried noodles. 

Service: This place was really busy, but we still got our food in a timely manner. I think they could make improvements to their waiting area and process since it's a small area by the doorway and lots of people just huddle around and there's no clear line. A woman cut in front of us when we were waiting at the front by the host table, so that was a bit annoying since there wasn't a very organized system or line.",1
"Stumbled upon this hidden gem when I was adventuring Chinatown and it definitely did not disappoint. The Xia Long Bao with pork was delicious! Very packed when I came here, but totally worth the wait!!",1
"Best Chinese food. I've been coming here for ~10 years. The dumplings taste like you've died and gone to heaven they are the best. I would come here just to get several servings of dumplings to myself and I'd be the happiest person alive. The atmosphere is nothing special and they pack people in by filling every seat, which means you'll be sitting at a table with strangers. However, the food is so good that the atmosphere doesn't even matter and you won't care about the weird couple sitting in front of you. You won't be disappointed-it's a must go to in nyc.",1
"My friend brought me here and it was on my list of places to visit in NY.

She ordered for us. We had the crab and beef (?) soup dumplings. I wasn't  a big fan of the crab but I definitely loved the beef one. It was delicious. 

I would definitely come here again. I hope to find a soup dumpling restaurant where I live.",1
"For some reason I thought this would be just a quick grab joint like many others in Chinatown.  But no, they have a full menu.  It's a sit-down place with communal tables and lots of hustle & bustle.

So you're looking at the menu...where are the soup dumplings you monsters!?!?  Don't you worry child, they offer those up front when they stop by to take orders.  And are totally cool with you only ordering dumplings and disregarding said menu.  You should do this.  

And maybe the pepper shrimp.  Thems boys were good.",1
"Dinkier location but it doesn't matter. The Xiao long bao are great and I always get them. Other good options are any seafood dishes, and some of the noodle dishes as well.",1
Get the dumplings get some of each pork &crab   always a wait but worth it,1
"cheap good food. their vinegar is different from every other soup dumpling place i've tried. no one can match up to it. Not as clean as I'd like it to be, but you can't expect anything more from a restaurant in chinatown. lines can be long, but it's worth the wait. you might share a table with other customers, but who cares - you're there for the soup dumplings, not the people or ambiance.",1
"The  soup dumplings were good, I can go either or..but the beef with broccoli, pork fried rice and fried chicken was delicious. Now they don't have duck sauce, but you don't need it. The chicken could have used a bit of salt, but went well with the tsing tao beer. Note be prepared to sit with strangers, and its cash only.",1
"Nursing a slight hangover, I finally got the SO to go dim-summing with me, only to learn, a 1-mile walk to Chinatown later, that Joe's Shanghai is NOT a dim sum place at all. Darn it, Yelp keyword search, daaaarn it! Should have done more research! Joe's menu is far more appropriate for a special occasion seafood outing a Chinese family might make than an early morning carbo-soak for the liquor-addled. But all was not lost...

What we DID find was New York's best-reputed soup dumplings. I went with the crab/pork combo. The 8 dumplings that came moments later were tasty--not perfectly chewy, but tantalizing enough to suck down a dozen. The dumplings bleed fatty, oily broth that looks as good as it tastes, and this is definitely the highlight of Joe's dumplings. We decided not to dip into more exotic options, like duck web with celery, but I did get an order of scallion dumplings that was awesome.

Joe's you've definitely thrown down the gauntlet for soup dumplings. There may be a better place for them in this big city of ours, but I haven't found it.",1
"Yes, it is that time of the year where I am to visit my big red apple, NYC...AgAin..
No rain will stop me going to Joe's Shanghai...

Awesome Service: I usually have good luck with the wait. I believe the usual wait is probably 45min to an hour. Everyone that do patiently wait, they know it is worth it. Also, they change our plates frequently and they are very responsive when we 
need service.

This restaurant reminds me I am dinning somewhere in Asia where you may just whine up sharing tables with other patrons which is fine by me because you just end up meeting new folks...

I only come here for the Shanghainese dumplings. We had three orders tonite along with onion pancakes, chicken veggie noodle soup, and spring beans. We also got an appetizer ( jellyfish & cold chicken)

This is the best place in the U. S. other than in Asia or Canada where you can get the Shanghainese dumplings where the skin is quite thin and very juicy.",1
"Delicious, collagen-rich soup dumplings with a filling almost as good as the soup inside.  Do NOT order anything else.  Save your stomach for all the soup dumplings you can eat!",1
"First time back in many years, and I must say, I am very happy with the changes. First off, the food was and still is great. Still the best soup dumplings in the city and some of the best and authentic Shanghainese food I've ever had in the US. The reason why I haven't been back in years was because of the poor service and cleanliness, but that all seems to be fixed now, even on a fairly busy Sunday night. Previously, the tables and chairs were so dirty that I didn't want to sit, the table next to me had a dead fly in their dish, and the waiters/waitresses were rude, aggressive, talked back, and just leave if you asked questions. Luckily I didn't have anything even close to that experience this past weekend. Much cleaner, good lighting, and our waiter helped tremendously with our orders and even cracked some good jokes. Completely changed my mind about the ambiance. 

While the wait can be long, the line moves fast and there are a lot of snacking shops nearby in Chinatown.",1
"Consistently great soup dumplings My favorites are the crab, pork ones.

Try to avoid large groups, it will be a wait. If you do have a large group, make sure everyone is there, or else they will not seat you.

Orange beef is very good, though it could be a little thinner like at Chinatown Brasserie. Most people come for the soup dumplings.",1
"This is a must visit every trip to New York. The best Chinese food anywhere. This place is an experience in itself. The tables are all big and they sit mixed parties together. The food has always been great every time we visit.

Must have:
Pork Soup Dumplings
Scallion Pancakes
Shanghai Noodles
Green Beans
CRISPY BEEF (MUST HAVE)


This place will not disappoint.",1
"NOTE: This place is cash only!! 

Love going here!!! Everything you get is really tasty, though some dishes are a bit on the heavier side because they're a bit greasy. 

You can't go wrong with their xiao long bao! It comes in pork or crab, but both are good! Pork is still going to be my first choice though. Give your xiao long pao a bit of hot chili oil to get a touch of more depth of flavor! 

Crispy pork chops are also real good! Paired with some simple shanghai fried rice is a really good meal. 

I don't mind this place not being the cleanest all the time because I love the food!",1
"Before I do my usual blathering, let me just say that the soup in these soup dumplings is THE BEST I have ever had, hands down. This made it all the more devastating when my second dumpling promptly spilled its treasure into not-my-mouth. (I won't confirm or deny that there were tears.) (ALSO they're CASH-ONLY, don't say I didn't warn you.)

The two of us showed up at the famous Joe's Shanghai around 8/8:30pm on Sunday evening, having worked up a pretty huge appetite. We were given a number and told we could expect to wait about 20 minutes, but 5 minutes later, we were being ushered in by our host without having needed our tickets. We sat down at a table with 3 other parties of 2 (so a table for 8, for those of us who are here to read about food and not to do math). 

Immediately after sitting down, we were asked if we wanted XLB. While my boyfriend was a little bit taken aback by this, having barely looked at the menu himself, I really appreciated this because I know that freshly-made XLB take a while to prepare and I wanted to eat them ASAP. I only hesitated when thinking if I should order 1 or 2 orders of the pork+crab XLB. (8 for $8.25 -- honestly a better deal than I was expecting) SO YUM YUM IN MY TUM TUM you guys. My boyfriend was a bit sad that the skin of the dumplings didn't hold up that well (aka the soup spilled and we cried, I mean, thought about crying but did not do it) but I didn't think it was a big deal at all.

I think we were only slightly miffed that we also ordered a vegetable dish (we had been eating really unhealthily up until then...) and it came out a decent bit after our XLB arrived. We were hoping to nosh on veggies before eating our XLB because we wanted to eat more afterwards... and so we settled on just one order of that delicious soupy goodness. 

Service was brisk but fast. You're not here for individualized attention, folks. You're here for delicious food. Even our simple veggie dish was soooooooooo tasty. Plus, the servers aren't even rude, they're just trying to get as much food to as many people as possible. I thought about that while staring at their wall of celeb photos, one of my favorite things to do while eating in New York.

Worth the hype. Go. Rejoice.",1
"I never thought dumplings could be so amazing! We tried this place last year as part of a NYC food crawl, and I must say this place really opened my eyes.

Non descript storefront in Chinatown didn't prepare me for the great meal to come.  We got there just before the lunch rush and the place filled up fast.

Definitely worth a visit - I wish we had something like this in Los Angeles.",1
"I come here every time I'm in Chinatown and I assure you this place never disappoints. It's tucked away on a side street that's pretty packed. I will admit if you get there around lunch time you will be waiting. Don't be surprised if you have to wait for 30 mins or longer but it will be worth it. 
I always bring people here whether they are from the area or out of state and each time I get the same thankful response. I actually started coming here as a child with my aunt and I've been going for at least 10 years. 
The place is pretty big with individual and family style seating. Usually they mix match groups at family styles which is pretty cool since it allows you to connect with others. 
Service is always fast and courteous. I always order pork soup dumplings along with a scallion pancake and a Tsing Tao. I've known others to order chicken or noodles and those were also amazing. When I got with one other person my bill is always under $20 and that includes tip. Even in a group of six we didn't pay more than $55. Make sure you have cash as they DO NOT take card. Definitely a place to visit when in NY.",1
"The steamed crab and pork dumplings really were delicious!  I ate them for my meal.  Everyone needs to be prepared to pay in cash though.  The menu is pricey and you should have lots of cash on hand.

I ate solo since I was just in town for a couple of days during Spring Break and stayed at a little hotel around the corner.  I went on a Tuesday and there was no wait.  So I suggest staying away from the typical Friday thru Sunday crowded nights.",1
"Let me start by saying that I gave up pork about 10 years ago. It was challenging at first, and often came at the extreme irritation of friends and family. About a month ago I decided to give up my ""pork is for dorks"" campaign and make the leap back in to swine dining. Here is my tale...

I have a group of old co-workers that when we worked together went on plenty of soup dumpling missions. I always had to sit on the sidelines because they don't make soup dumplings without pork or seafood (which I'm allergic to).  Well, when I decided to dive back into the belly of the beast what better way then to finally partake in a soup dumpling reunion dinner! So we decided on Joe's because allegedly they have the best in the city.  I was surprised at the wait on a Monday night at 8:30, the place was jam packed! For 5 of us we waited about half hour, and we ended up sharing a table with a another couple. The soup dumplings were free flowing (it's one of their signature dishes so they pass them out like candy). OK time for the big jump.................................................
the pork dumplings were good, not amazing. The meat inside was like sausage (I have always disliked sausage from any animal). The soup and the dumpling part were pretty good though. I must say that we got a number of other dishes and they were all quality (that's where 3 stars come in). I'm giving the 4th star for atmosphere, cause I always feel like I'm really in China when I go to Pell street (plus is super close to my favorite teahouse-Teariffic). OOOOh, and they give you the most delicious orange slices after your meal.

All in all the pork dumplings were not worth me sacrificing my chances of getting into the Nation of Islam (that and the fact that I believe Farrakhan is an evil man)

I'll keep you posted on my adventures in Babe-land

HUNGRY HIPPO CHOICE: Scallion pancakes (best I've had)",1
"TIme: Lunch and Dinner

Who: w/ friends (groups no bigger than 4 people)

Price: around $10 per entry

Recommendation: Go here once and try it out. This place is always packed! You will most likely share a table with strangers. Order the dumplings. Basically, they're soup dumplings that explode in your mouth. Eat with caution, but eat with ginger and soy sauce. Use chopsticks, not forks. The goal is to have all the soup in your mouth and not all over your plate and pants. 

Note: This is the NYC's equivalent of Din Tai Fung of Los Angeles or in Shanghai or Taipei. 

Other Info: Cash only. Located next to a go barber shop $7. So if you're feeling fly after you eat, get a haircut. 

Locals: Too packed for comfort. I wouldn't go here after once. 
Tourists: Prepare to wait in line, but give it a try. It's a taste of Asia in NYC. Be careful not to burn yourself...",1
I am salivating just thinking about Joe's soup dumplings. A required stop every time I'm in NYC.,1
Yum yum yum!!!!! Wth this place is the good!! Most def worth the wait to get in.. The smell outside is so inviting yummmmmmy!!,1
"*the wait is ridiculous. Come early so you can get a number for a table.
*you know why you're here: soup dumplings!
*their sesame chicken is also very delicious and recommended.",1
"Okay, all the stuff I previously said except now 4 stars because they make the best orange chicken I've ever had in my life.

THE EFFING BEST ORANGE CHICKEN, EVAR!!!",1
Always a treat to come here when I visit NYC. Good food at a great price. Be prepared to wait during lunch and dinner rush.,1
"Being a man from China and having been to both Midtown and Chinatown Joe Shanghai's, I must say the Chinatown one is a must. Sure it's in a somewhat dirtier neighborhood, the $5 soup dumplings are to die for. They're cheaper and hence more volumous in Chinatown, so you could seriously get like 5 plates for your party and pay a measly $25. 

The only thing is that, I wouldn't get anything else from Joe's Shanghai. It's not known for anything else, and everything else is kinda overpriced for simple vegetables. I kinda see this place as a go to take out place to get bang for buck and instant satisfaction.",1
"Cheap eats, and so worth the wait.

Go inside to grab a ticket and get your name on the list. Then, get back on that sidewalk because the line actually moves fairly quick. It's a very fast-paced restaurant, and you don't wanna miss your spot! Waited about 30 mins. Not bad, very fast wait.

We only ordered 1 order of the pork soup dumplings for $6.75. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS. 8 of these dumplings split between my bf and I, was just enough to satisfy (looking back, I wish I ordered more, but that is the gluttony talking!!!). Sit down, and take a good moment to enjoy these delicious things. 

The soy sauce mixture is a little reminiscent of vinegar, but I thought it was tasty spooned on top of the dumplings. Or you can eat them plain. Your preference!

A must-try and must-stop for every NY trip.",1
"Shout out to my 16 yr old niece who suggested we go. She really likes their soup dumplings and I see why. We got the pork filled dumpling which isn't overly seasoned, yet still very flavorful. I'll warn you as she warned me, be careful when biting into it b/c the liquid inside is hot. 

We also got the scallion pancake  (really good), shrimp fried rice (good and generous amount of shrimp, and the General Tso (good). It was a lot of food for two people, which we quickly realized as we got full and realized what little space there was at our table. Being just the two of us, were seated at a table with a lovely party of 3, who like us.... had eyes bigger than their stomachs (they ordered a lot too). 

The space and location... I have to say I like. It's on an extremely narrow street and very tight inside.  The decor isn't fancy, but what they have going on looks fine, clean, and the pics, awards, articles on the walls are a testament to how good they are. Plus, with so many people waiting to get in (despite it being crowded) is another good sign that's it's worth it. Only downside, not once did anyone stop by to refill waters or see if we wanted more drinks. 

TIPS: They only take cash. They only seat you once your entire group is present. A 15% service charge/tip is automatically added to bill. When you arrive immediately find the host with the clipboard, you're name won't be added to the list, but your group size will and you'll get a #.",1
"Great spot in Chinatown for some very good food. The soup dumplings are a thing to behold. Make sure you pick them up the right way or you will ruin one and look like a tourist in the process.  Getting here pretty much any time after opening means waiting for a table.  If you are just a small group, you may be seated with other people. Not very big inside. Service is quick and helpful. They are pretty organized in running things from what I've seen and have never had a problem with our orders.  Worth making a stop here for next fix of Chinese food.",1
"Okay 2 words SOUP DUMPLING are amazing! They are just the balance of savory and yum! The place is small and fast. They even might sit you at a table with other people, it's ok just be friendly plus they might even give you some helpful suggestions like us! We had the soup dumplings are a must do not pass up these pillowy purses of broth and pork (just watch you don't burn your mouth they come out pipping hot). I had soup and my friends had pan fried noodles, both very tasty. The people next to us had the salt and pepper shrimp  they looked so deliciously crispy!! I'm totally getting g the next time. 
I was a little nervous reading some of the other reviews that didn't rave about this place, but to each is own, right!! My friends and I loved it, great food, good service, and great prices!! Oh beer and wine only! Enjoy! Tip: not sure how to eat a soup dumpling look around the room and you'll be a pro in no time.",1
"So good!!! Had read good reviews of this place and wanted to go while we were in NY, it was an hour wait but it's near some cool bars so we just went and got drinks while we waited. Got the soup dumplings and orange chicken-both were amazing! The service was good and the food came surprisingly fast. 10/10 would recommend",1
"Pretty good Crab and Pork Xiao Long Bao. As someone from LA, I still prefer the Din Tai Fung on the west coast. Look forward to try other dishes next time I'm in NYC.",1
"i'll echo everyone else's reviews and recommend the pork and the crab/pork soup dumplings! c'mon, 8 pork soup dumplings for under $5?? SCORE!

we showed up wednesday night around 9pm and got lucky that we didn't have to wait in any lines. they did start seating other groups with strangers if there was room at the table. lucky for us we were a group of 4 with our own table=P.

we ordered the typical pork soup dumplings, pork/crab soup dumplings, scallion pancake, shanghai fried flat noodle, & the pork fried rice. not sure if it was bc we were tired from all the walking we did, but the food just hit the right spot for all of us. haha greasy chinese food after a tiring night is always the best!

i should say though i much prefer the soup dumplings back home at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia.  For those of you visiting so cal and in search of some awesome soup dumplings...Din Tai Fung all the way. the soup dumplings here are wrapped more thinly with a bit more flavor. though joe's shanghai is really well priced for what they do offer.

remember..Cash Only!",1
"THE BEST SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS IN THE US!
I may be a bit biased because this is the first restaurant that I had shanghai dumplings, so it has a special place in my heart. However, I have gone on a search for good dumplings on the west coast, tried shanghai dumpling king, tried din tai fung, still nothing compares. Not to mention that their pricing is UNBEATABLE! You can order a couple of orders of the dumplings +chow mein for less than $20! The only bad part is that there is a very long wait, so be sure to get there early or you'll be waiting 45+ mins in the Quicklys next door. The do sit multiple parties in a large table to conserve space, so if you're claustrophobic, you better get over your fears because these dumplings are worth it!",1
this place is perfect so please dont go cause i dont want to share soup dumplings or wait on line behind you to get them. the seasonal vegetables are good too. salty and soupy and perfect. but the dumplings.,1
"Great soup dumplings. I was ecstatic when I got on a Cathay Pacific flight and they served them in business class. Made the 20-hour flight that much better.

I've had the other entrees here and it's pretty standard. Go for the soup dumplings.",1
"Good lord these are amazing and there's NO competition. I always end up ordering a non soup dumpling option and regret it, so just stick to #1 and #2 on the menu and you can't go wrong. If you HAVE to order something on the side get lo mein or the General Tsos. Also help yourself to the unlimited tea.",1
This is not the Joe's I remember on Doyer.  This new Bowery location is modern and spacious.  Soup dumplings remain above par.  The've got a nice amount of soup inside medium thickness wrappers.  Joes is the only place in CTown I know that also serves a delicious braised tofu over a bed of steamed spinach.,1
"Every single time I visit NYC, I make it a point to stop at Joe's Shanghai. Yes, you'll have to wait, but it's SO worth it. Basically, you put your name down and wait for your name to be called. No fancy pager system, they're keeping it old school. Usually they're pretty spot on with their time estimate, so I'll walk around, get a massage, have a pre-meal treat and still get back with enough time to stand around and wait.

My go-to order is scallion pancakes, soup dumplings and chicken lo mein. Everything is incredible, but the juicy soup dumplings are really the star of the show. The service is HELLA quick because they're trying to get people in and out as fast as possible. And, I appreciate that. If after waiting an hour, you don't know what you want, you're doing it wrong.

They bring out orange slices with your check, which is a fun little touch. Be warned that this spot is CASH ONLY, so come prepared.",1
I didn't understand stand why people love Xiao Long Bao before until I had the best one at Joe's Shanghai. The dumpling and the soup inside was amazingly delicious. All the staff were also very helpful and nice.,1
Awesome xiaolongbao! I go there almost every month for the xiaolongbao. Double fried noodle is good too!,1
"Heard that Joes was the spot famous for Dumplings and after the reviews decided to check it out.

It was a bit hard to located as I didn't know my way around Chinatown well. The sitting in the place is interesting as you have to share the table with random people. 

The food here is pretty good and portions are pretty large and the price isnt too bad. Recommend it but its average compared to L.A. joints.",1
"Got the soup dumplings and I have to say, I prefer the pork over the crab. Really good soup dumplings!!!! So much soup in each dumpling. We got some more food on the side and it wasn't as good. The shanghai fried rice is very plain, and the green beans could've had some more frying in the pan (they were soggy and a little bland). 

Appreciated the fast service so that they can get you in and out fast.",1
"Soup dumplings are awesome... I like the scallion pancakes, mapo tofu and veggies too.

I saw John Noble, the crazy scientist from Fringe here. He likes the soup dumplings too!",1
Came here when it was raining outside and they got me and my girlfriend seated quickly. They have a lot of workers doing different jobs to allow for quick service. As soon as we sat down a server came by and we put in a order for the xiao long bao. They served us water and in about 15minutes our first order came out and we put in an order for the deep fried pork chops and fried rice. The xiao long bao was pretty good and very cheap! The deep fried pork chops and fried rice was good. If you are in a hurry and just want some warm food to pass the cold weather they do a good job on getting people in and out. I would come back here but maybe just order 4 orders of the xiao long bao.,1
"We came here with our NY native cousins, Sophia and Vivian, for lunch during our summer vacation. OH MY GOD!!!  Dumplings are delicious!  Our 3 kids couldnt get enough.  We must of gone through 6 or 7 trays of dumplings.  Our 9 year old daughter (picky eater) was scooping the drippings from her plate!  We also had the crispy deep fried noodles, that was very good as well. This place gets packed!  So make sure you get there early!",1
"The nyc gold standard for xlb.  My first bite completely scalded the inside of my mouth which was embarassing as 20 plus strangers are seated with you at a large table staring at each other, yet it was still delicious.   Wait was long but worth it.",1
"Why are you here other than the fact that you are coming for their famous soup dumplings? If it's to be around the street with a history of chinese gang shootings, then continue along. Otherwise, come here for shanghai food! 

Super fast, quick paced and good turnover for seats, I luckily didn't have to wait on a weekday before 7 PM. Past 7, there were lines that were starting to form. 

XLB: I LOVE IT. Great huge XLB with plenty of soup in it. Stellar, worth it. I really enjoy the regular XLB versus the other variations. 
Scallion Pancakes: Damn freshly fried pancakes, you do me in. Love it, definitely a great appetizer. 
Shanghai Rice Cakes: Ahh.. this is sounding repetitive. Delicious and tasty. Only thing were the noodles were a bit on the oily side. 
Broad Noodles: Also quite delicious - plenty of pork mixed in with the noodles.
Szechuan Style String Beans: I loved these. Other places I went to do an ok job with this dish, but damn was this amazing. While I loved all the food I ate here, this was actually my standout dish. 

Loved eating here, sadly I can't just come here everyday. Overall, it isn't that overly expensive for their food and drinks. 

RUN HERE.",1
"Let me caveat by saying that the five stars are for the Soup Dumplings ONLY. If i never have to eat anything else, I'll have Soup Dumplings the rest of my life, with ginger and whatever is in that soy sauce they give u at the table. i've gone to the one in Flushing at least 5 times in the past two years, and the last two times I was there, I brought one group of ladies from toronto and they said ""Hey! I've heard about this place!"" they're from toronto!!! 

I also had the fried eggplant, which was served in half a cup of greasy frying oil. oil aside, the eggplants were very very good as well. 

The beef noodle soup is my go to dish at any chinese restaurant, but the soup they serve at Joe's is always toooo salty for my liking. 

Make sure you get there before/after the lunch/dinner rush or else you could be waiting up to an hour for a table. 

And also, this restaurant is VERY foreigner friendly. At any point in time there is almost a 50/50 split of consumers who are Asian and all other. :) enjoy!",1
"After wandering around Chinatown deciding where to eat, we happened upon Joe's Shanghai and decided to take a friend's suggestion to eat here. Obviously, the soup dumplings were the thing to try, and so we did. My vegetarian friend told us that from her non-veggie days, the crab ones were the one to go for. I don't really like seafood, but I thought that crab would be relatively safe. SO FISHY OMG. I like the soup dumpling experience, but the crab was over the top fishy for me. Next time I will go for pork.

Vegetarians: The mixed vegetables with bean curd was INCREDIBLE. I've had my share of bean curd, but this was by far the best I have ever had. It was totally saturated with the sauce, but perfectly crunchy on the ends. Mmmmmm.

I can't say that I loved the scallion pancakes. They were fairly average.

But seriously. The mixed vegetables and bean curd. The underdog at Joe's Shanghai. Get it in addition to your soup dumplings.",1
SEXY SOUPY XIAOLONG BAO!!! We went for lunch and the wait was pretty short. Great noisy Asian place to spend with your great noisy Asian family. The staff was fast and the dumplings...OH MAH GAWD the dumplings were hot and fresh. I loved how the skin was so saggy because the filling produced so much soup while they were being steamed. The dumpling skin had a nice chewiness to the texture. mmm I will eat you when I come back.,1
"My tastebuds have tried the best XLBs this world could offer. From the ones in Shanghai to Taiwan, and even to CA, my tastebuds have gracefully had them all.

This resturant is a bit different. First of all, it's super popular so there is a line and they do not take reservations. Second, you'll meet someone new as the tables are all communal. We waited about 30 mins for lunch.

Price: About $10 per dish

Food: The XLB here are bigger than the ones I have had and the skin is a little thicker (which is not my preference), but the flavor is kicking. Each bite is full of flavor and it takes multiple bites for these XLB. The MUST order dishes are the original pork XLB and the crab and pork XLB.

Service: They are super busy, but it's just like any other Asian restaurant.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is a lot of fun.  It feels very ""authentic"" (whatever that word means these days).  I am Chinese and have had a lot of dumplings and xiao long boa in my life (including in Shanghai), so I can't say that the dumplings and XLB were the best I've ever had.  However, they were definitely yummy, and I would go back (and wait in line).  The service is quick (though not friendly, but what can you expect from a Chinese restaurant).  

One thing that was off-putting was the smell when you walk in - the sour smell was confusing.  It was either the smell of feet on a hot summer day OR the smell of the red vinegar you put on the dumplings.  I chose to think it was the dumpling vinegar.",1
"I wish I lived in NY just so I could eat here every weekend. By far the best Chinese food I've ever had. You won't be dining in for the experience or the ambiance but the food makes up for it tenfold! You walk in, take a number for the hostess, and wait outside. Don't be frightened by the amount of people waiting outside, our wait went by really fast. (10 minutes or so). You sit at a table with other diners so there won't be any privacy. We ordered the scallion pancakes, pork dumplings, and shanghai noodles. All were AMAZING! It was my first time at a restaurant like this so my bf and I didn't know the way to eat the dumplings. You place them in the soup spoon so that the broth ends up in the spoon instead of your plate. Mmmmm they were sooo delicious!!! I hope to go back the next time I'm in NY!",1
"The soup dumplings are really great, and the prices are not bad.  Eight bucks with tax and tip gets you an amazing meal!",1
"It was such an ordeal trying to find this place at ten o'clock at night. Traveling the streets of N.Y. with two 70 yr olds, one 7 yr old & two republicans was not easy. Starving for great Chinese food someone had suggested & trying to meet our cousins..... But in the end - WELL WORTH THE JOURNEY.  If you crave good authentic Chinese food, this is the place. No B.S. just good food. For you first timers, try the soup dumplings, they're sooooo worth it!",1
Delicious and affordable comfort food! Yummy juicy buns. The customer service is not too impressive but most Chinese restaurants don't offer good customer service especially if their food is good.,1
"This is in my top 3 places to take people when they come to the city from out of town.

I hate to be repetitive but...

SOUP.  DUMPLINGS.

There is simply no comparison.  I was skeptical at first but after my first bite I was in love.  I am not a big guy but I can finish an entire helping by myself (if you've been there you know that's terribly gluttonous).  

I LOVE that the servers scowl at you if you don't start with the soup dumplings.  So awesome.

Everything I have ever had here is good.  The noodles are good.  The standards (Kung Pow, Tso's) are good.  The crazy stuff is good.  Just a fantastic all-around Chinese restaurant.

I do hate that they don't take reservations and sometimes the wait is a bit... well... just whets my appetite more to be honest with you.

I gotta say, though, why won't these darn places start taking credit cards?  Hit an ATM before you go because they are cash only!",1
"Well this place is a hidden gem of Chinatown! I mean I'm sure it's famous but you have to enter through  like an alley to get here so it makes you feel like you know a great place. When you come in, it's family style seating, which mean you sit a big table with Probably 2 other couples who just got there or just finishing up. Which is kinda awkward of you all order the same thing and forget which one is yours. The Xiao long bao here is is sooo good! One of the best I've had! The lions head is also very very very good! It's sooo juicy and rich, I had to ask for a bowl of rice to counter the flavors. We ended up taking most of it to go and ate it back at the hotel. Also still all very good!",1
"We went on a Saturday morning for brunch. The place was empty. We realized after being seated that this was a CASH only place. How inconvenient!  Had I known we would have gone to another place that took credit card payment. 

You get menus to order. There isn't much of a dumpling selection. We asked the table next to us what they would recommend. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, the pan fried dumplings, sesame noodles and scallion pancake. Nothing amazing but it was good in its simplicity. I recommend going in with an open mind, cash and set no expectations.  The food is simple and tasty. 

My friend said that the place looks renovated. The design is simple and clean. Good lighting. Clean floors.",1
The best soup dumplings ever!! A must go when in Chinatown NYC!!! But it can get packed so you will most likely sit next to random people!! But by the time you taste the dumpling... You'll forget your name.!!,1
The dumplings to start off we're excellent! Apparently very popular as well. Followed the dumplings up with some general tso's chicken and crunchy shredded beef. It was a highly satisfying meal.,1
"I love going to Asian restaurants and a bunch of us dropped by here. The staff is nice enough and there's a casual, relax vibe to the place. You may have to share a table with strangers, huge plus in my book. Like the wise man in the van said, strangers are just friends you haven't met yet.

Go with the soup dumplings, there are different varieties but the ones I had are great. Juicy with nice flavors. I'm told they're translated to ""little dragon buns"" . . . All in all, a great stop for a visit. Thank you, I'll come again.",1
Awesome soup dumplings. Excellent sesame chicken as well. Generous portions for everything!,1
"Awesome dumplings! We got the General Tso's and some white rice. Food was fast, fresh, and delicious!",1
Soup dumplings and their lo mein is some of the best i have ever had.  Be prepared for a line though!,1
"I'll never understand why there is a huge line in almost every good-looking restaurant in the US, however the food was worth the wait (almost 1 hour in the cold). People were just so brain-frozen to even think of the food they wanna eat after they finally got inside. The service is quick and they serve you with some hot tea which is great. Pork dumplings are very delicious and the portions of other orders are pretty big for a person. Good pricing as well. Loved the place all in all.",1
"Best soup dumplings ever.  My wife and I come here all the time.  Get the crab ones  they have way more flavor then the plain pork.  The best thing about this place is getting seated with complete strangers.  My wife hates it, but I love watching the rookies.  It's so funny to see people take a burning hot dumpling with boiling hot soup and shove the whole thing in their mouth.  Watching them spit it out is just too much.  Watching people trying to chew it back instead of spitting it out is even better.  They start tearing up and the only thing in arms reach is hot tea.  People walk out of this place with no taste buds and double tip for third degree burns.  Just remember the tip is included.",1
"Amazing food but a little crowded. 

We tried out this place on our first visit in NYC. Like all other places we have come to learn....its quite crowded. We waited about 15 minutes at 10 pm at night which is really fast. We were seated at a large table which threw me off and made me feel slightly uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, i love getting to know new people but with Chinese food - my husband and I order a few different dishes and the table was crowded. I also get anxiety so this was just not the best eating experience which ultimately led to us eating half our food and packing up the rest to eat at the hotel. 

The food was amazing!! We ordered the scallion pancake which was perfect! We ordered the soup dumpings which were soo yummy. We also ordered the vegetable fried rice and General Tso chicken which so full of flavor and crispy. All of the food was delicious.  My recommends would be to definetly try this place out and if the crowds are not your thing try going during the week.",1
Bring cash! Fill your belly with lots of delicious food. Fun time all around. Great spot to share with friends.,1
"This place is the mecca of pork soup dumplings. Came to this place twice during our recent NYC trip.  These dumplings have plenty of soup in each one, so care needs to be had when enjoying these.

Don't expect great decor or friendly service. Cash only...so be prepared.",1
great soup dumplings and they got models as waiters. the duck was nothing special but their crispy chicken was great. the skin on the soup dumpling was pretty thick compared to other places. pancakes and noodles were pretty solid,1
"Excellent soup dumplings .  The wait for a table can be rather long though.  They do have a large selection of wonderful dishes besides soup dumplings. If you are into meat, get the shank!  Big, a little fatty but delicious!!!  This place is one of our family's favorites",1
"Excellent Shanghai dumplings! A very full bodied broth coupled with a meatball filling, the xlb is exactly what you'd expect from a Shanghai dumpling place.

My girlfriend, her friend, and I navigated through Chinatown to find this place so I could try it! (I'm from California, so east coast eateries were my main conquest for this trip) I was not disappointed. I ate until I could eat no more. Joe's Shanghai is a must have if you're ever in Chinatown.",1
"FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS! Like Chinese saying, if smth is important, you must say it 3 times!

I'm not going to comment on their other dishes. They are good and decent, but you get those dishes anywhere in a regular chinese restaurant. So I'm going to skip reviewing on those dishes. 

BUT BAM! SOUP DUMPLINGS! OMG. THESE SOUP DUMPLINGS ARE SUPER BOMB ASS SOUP DUMPLINGS i am running out of words to describe how good they are. Not only they are cheap ass budget friendly very affordable unlike some restaurant(s), they are also HUGE in size (tbh i think that's americanized, but its a good modification imo ;P). And on top of that, they just simply taste great! 

The soup just rushes out as you bite into it, and THAT IS HOW SOUP DUMPLINGS SHOULD BE! The skin is very thin and saggy, EXACTLY HOW GOOD SOUP DUMPLINGS SHOULD BE. There's plenty of air room inside the dumpling, and lots of soup contained inside, with a decent amount of meat. THAT'S HOW SOUP DUMPLINGS SHOULD BE.

Yes, I repeat many times! Soup dumplings are NOT supposed to have thick skins! many places have this mistake, where they make thick ass soup dumpling skins, which just kills the entire dish. Also thick skin means not enough soup inside, unless they are very stingy on their meat... 

I certainly do not want to go to Ding Tai Fung anymore after coming to this place for soup dumplings. I was only in NYC for 5 nights, and I HAD to come here for two dinners because I just fell in love with their soup dumplings.

If I'm visiting NYC again, I'm definitely coming back for another round of 30 soup dumplings hehe :P",1
"Really, what is the point of telling you what you already know? 

Shanghai dumplings / xiao long bao / those ones with the soup in it / just try it already dang it!

Don't be all annoying and try and order other dishes (maybe a veggie one or two just to help things along.)  I can make an entire meal of the happiness and so can you - just beware burned tongues!

I hope someday to date someone who loves dumplings as much as me - is that too much information?",1
"The dumplings were AWESOME! We got both soup dumplings. The service was loud. I also saw Kevin from Top Chef! which gave the experience a big plus. Other than that, we were situated with another family (awkward). They expect you to order as FAST as possible. We had to wade off waiters asking us multiple times that we weren't sure what to get. The food was pretty good (not extraordinary good), but the soup dumplings were one of my favorite experiences in New York. Price was reasonable, but I would totally come here again, even if it means sitting with another family.",1
"I've been here twice in the last few months and they are great!!! Best soup dumplings outside of Shanghai. The price is also really good. You will often have to sit with others and they don't take reservations so that might be a drawback for some folks. Overall if you want great food, cheap prices, check this place out",1
"I Could live off of their soup dumplings, they truly are delicious! The meat is well cooked and the broth is light but richly flavored.  
The rest of the menu is averagely priced and good but nothing worth fussing over. If you like Asian food and love soup dumplings then this is the spot for you. 
Do expect a possible 20 minute wait if you go in the evening on a weekend, and a possible wait weekday evenings too. 
But I'll say it's worth the wait if you've never been there just to give their dumplings a try. However if you want a full meal worth raving over I'd suggest going in the day just for the dumplings.",1
"Please get the soup dumplings! Never would I have thought shrimp and pork would mix, but boy oh boy was I missing out! Make sure to poke a whole and let the steam out before biting into them, or you'll be in for a hot surprise ;-) 

Also tried their fish and dry noodles (forgot to snap a pic) and they were both delicious! If you're in the area make sure to stop by!",1
"Had to check it out about reading reviews online and in Yelp. I ordered pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. The scallion pancakes were surprisingly good, while the soup dumplings did live up to the hype. Expect a long wait if you eating in groups of 2 or more. It's also very cramped inside so they might places multiple groups in the same table.",1
"Oh my!  How I love these xia long bao -- Shanghai Soup Dumplings!   
Just wish I could find some coming even close in San Francisco!  

You order one pork, one shrimp the minute you sit down.  Then look at the menu, see what else sounds good and order something else once the dumplings are delivered.  

Eat carefully -- your tongue will be scalded forever from the piping hot delicious broth nestled inside each delicate dumpling.  

If you don't want to wait, go during an off-hour. Get there at 2 or 3 p.m. and you'll be seated right away, sometimes sharing a big round table with others already there.  

After you eat here, walk down Pell towards Chinatown, and on the corner is the oldest continuing shop in Chinatown -- it is chock-full of wonderful curios and the owners are delightful.  Prices are great too.",1
"Soup dumplings were great,  and the other items were good. Nothing outstanding, but satisfying nonetheless. The restaurant was nice, clean and service was fast. Don't forget it's cash only.",1
"Cash only. Get your soup dumplings here. The seating is group style,  and encourages sharing.  Other than soup dumplings, another favorite is jellyfish.  It looks like onions and tastes smokey and ligament like. Not a gooey taste but still pretty good cold app. For the main dish besides the dumplings I got chicken and broccoli which a lot of others were getting too . Overall, worth the trek to Chinatown.",1
"Soup dumplings are delicious-but the real star here is the Chinese food. Best Lo mein and crispy beef I've ever had. Tight dining room with some communal tables-but my husband and I actually met some very cool exchange student from Italy! No frills, but so very worth the wait.",1
"The reviews don't lie. Amazing food. Great place to try when in Chinatown. It was packed so you know the food is good! Bring cash, it's cash only!",1
"Best Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.
They just moved from their historic location and opened a new place around the block with a renewed and eye-catching style.
When it comes to these things I still prefer the old and ugly looking space that almost feels unwelcoming but that's still gives the authentic Chinatown experience. But that's my personal and obviously nostalgic opinion and it doesn't matter.
So, please order the soup dumplings, they are the best ever.",1
"Chicken and shrimp in plum sauce! Gosh, I want to eat that again right now. I came here last weekend on Saturday at an odd 4:30 time. It was surprisingly packed, but only had to wait 10 minutes for seating. 

The service was extremely quick and the food is just so good. Soup dumplings are of course a must have here. You are seated at your table and the first thing the waiter asks you is if you want soup dumplings. Just say yes. The shanghai noodles were delicious too.",1
"You have to come here for the soup dumplings!  If you don't, you haven't really lived life to its fullest!",1
Great soup dumplings!  We made mistake to order other items off their menu.  We should have only order their amazing soup dumplings because we felt everything else was just okay in comparison.,1
Best soup dumpling in NYC. Go early for a shorter wait and order soup dumplings as soon as you get to your seats. If you have room get the scallion pancake as well.,1
"This place is not hard to miss. There wasn't a long line when we went (around 8pm on a Saturday night) but we waited at least 20 minutes to be seated. It was so crowded that they will seat you in a big table with other people you don't know. It was also stuffy. I couldn't breath that good.

We ordered the famous Xiao Long Bao (pork and crab) - which was the best dumplings I've ever had! Soooo good I wanted more!!! I also love the yang chow (spelling?) that we ordered. The prices were also cheap. 

Prepare to bring cash. They only accept cash.",1
"Let me make this clear,  this four stars are for the the Shanghai dumplings only.  Now with that said,  in to the review.  

This place is known for their dumplings so it was a no brainer to stop here since I was in NYC for the week (so sad that it was only a week,  oh why can't I be richer! ?) 

We ordered the dumplings, Shanghai noodles and red bean flat cake thingy (I forget what it was called exactly). The dumplings were as praised. They were huge,  full with soup, and everything about them was good.  The rest of our food was pretty bad.  The noodle and red beam cake were so oily and tasteless that we didn't even care to finish them. 

After l leaving all I could think about was how stupid I was for not ordering just the dumplings but instead wasted my stomach room for crappy middle and red bean cake.  So the very next day I came back for more,  except this time I only ordered the dumplings.  I'm so proud of myself lol

If you are a fan of Shanghai dumplings then this is the place to go!  Also they charge a 15% service fee on everything regardless of your party size or how much you order.",1
"Already a regular of Joe's Shanghai although I've only been here a month, I'm always after the scallion pancakes and soup dumplings! 

Though the skin on the soup dumplings could be a bit thinner for the true soup dumpling texture and taste that I so enjoy, Joe's Shanghai has its own spin on it - there's so much soup packed into each one, and a generous amount of filling/meat in each one too! And at its price in a place like New York (8 soup dumplings for ~$8-9), it really can't get better than this. The scallion pancakes are another favorite dish of mine, partially because of the delicious sweet sauce that they use with it too! They're also really affordable, at around $5 for a stacked plate. Joe's Shanghai has a very modest storefront and only accepts cash, but there's always a line out the door waiting to be seated during peak lunch and dinner hours. I've already taken my friends and my boyfriend here to visit, and they've all loved it. 

Great service and quality of food - I'd definitely come back again!",1
"This was the highlight of my trip to NY. The food was so flavorful and fresh. The beef and rice cake was very yummy and the pan fried vegetable noodles were delicious. 

We ordered the pork soup dumplings. The broth was so rich and savory, it was mind blowing.  I can't get that flavor out of my head it was so good. This will be a tradition for me when in NY. Bravo!!!",1
"The most iconic Chinese restaurant in chinatown by far! The food is always amazing, best beef with broccoli in Manhattan and the soup dumplings are amazing! Staff is usually curt, but it doesn't matter because the food is always sooooo good! The soup dumplings are cheap but sometimes other things on the menu can be pricey for no reason!",1
"Not much new to add. Most of the dishes we ordered were fairly standard, and the staff certainly wants to move you in and out. Now to thier claim to fame, the soup dumplings. The pork dumplings were delish and the crab dumplings were superb.  A must try if you're out in New York.",1
"After waiting in line outside for a half hour to try out Joes, we walked into a very cool, high energy environment. The entire restaurant(which holds about 115 people) is communal seating. I believe 9 people fit at a round table inside. We immediately ordered the soup dumplings which are an obvious MUST. They were perfectly cooked and bursting with warm soup inside! We also had the kung pao chicken which was great and the Lo mein(PHENOMENAL)! We will def be back!",1
"I'm torn on how to approach this review.  On one hand, the place is cramped and you never get a whole table to yourself.  Also your entire party needs to be present at time of seating, which I'll forgive due to their busy nature.  They take cash only.  And finally, there is virtually no foyer so in the dead of winter you are stuck waiting outside for your number to be called while your fingers and toes scream for mercy.

On the other hand, it's delicious.  The xiao long tang bao's (pork, don't waste your money on the crab ones) should be eaten rapidly - not only because it tastes better hot, but to compete savagely for the last dumpling.  I always leave this place with my jeans unbuttoned.

Other noteworthy dishes: shanghai noodles, string beans w/ pork (rice not included)",1
"(This review is based on the skins & soup of the xiao long bao [soup dumplings] alone.)

Located on a tiny street in Chinatown and famous for its xiao long bao. Unfortunately for me, they did not have a pork or crab substitute (since I can't eat either of those), so my friends generously donated 4 of the skins to me. So from what I tasted, it was good, but I really wish I could have tried it for real.

The restaurant was extremely crowded because everyone loves this place, so we waited out at least half an hour in the Chinese snack shop down the street and ate a bunch of samples before coming here.",1
"This place is really worth the hype. Usually I don't think that way about places and think they are overrated, but not this place. I think it's also because I went on a Monday when there wasn't a huge crowd. We actually got seated right away and were served promptly. You go for the soup dumplings of course. The menu is a bit confusing as it doesn't actually say ""soup dumplings"" but if you just ask them for the soup dumplings they'll explain it to you. If you are in the mood and craving something warm this is definitely the place!",1
"After dinner in Chinatown failed the previous night, I planned to try Joe's Shanghai.
But, I was too lazy to head back downtown.
Scrolling through Yelp, I discovered that Joe's has a second location at 56th street, only a few blocks from my hotel.
Upon arrival, I feared that the waiting line would subvert my revised plan.
The polite hostess informed me that I could be seated - in 45 minutes.
However, after less than 10 minutes I was at an upstairs table.
Service is on-the-spot.
Multiple members of the staff attending to several tables at once.
Likely to guarantee fast turnover and maximize service.
However, at no time were they rude or pushy, just immediate and attentive.
I started with pork bun (soup) dumplings.
Very good.
A tasty broth surrounding seasoned pork in a doughy wrap.
6 to an order; sizable and satisfying. 
I followed with an order of Szechuan string beans with minced pork and clams in black bean sauce.
Both platters were fresh and hot; prepared well and tastily seasoned.
The meal more than redeemed my craving for good chinese food.
Prices on the higher side, I was not put off because (1) I got a table quickly during dinner hour on a Saturday night; and (2) it was good food with good service.
Good possibility I would be back during my next trip. 


Returned twice more.
Each time the food is as good as expected.
And, service is always excellent.
Recommended!!",1
"A totally unnecessary review since Joe's is (in)famous, but just to put it in writing: sit down, don't ask many questions (prepare to feel rushed/confused), but order so many soup dumplings. Rinse and repeat. Joe's is perfect.",1
"Thought the meat dumplings filled with spoon size soup were delicious and will revisit soon. Only wish, I had known about the restaurant's unusual practice of including 15% tip on the bill- Won't double tip next time, thanks to yelpers.",1
"I had been craving good Xiao Long Boa (steamed soup dumplings) for sooo long. There is nothing on the west coast that has impressed me so far, so I was excited to come here when we had a chance to visit New York. 

This place came highly recommended by my friend. She comes here every time she comes to New York. And it did not disappoint. 

I was surprised to find no long line-up like the reviews suggest (we were there on a Saturday 11:30 seating), however, it was lightly raining outside. 

We were seated with a bunch of strangers (reminds me of asia!) and proceeded to order the soup dumplings (SOO juicy), onion pancakes, and a soup based noodle that I can't remember anymore. 

Top it all off, it's super cheap! YAY! So satisfying.",1
"The soup dumplings are a must!!! I also love the fried rice, being from the West Coast it is difficult to find the right flavor for fried rice in NYC and this place nailed it!",1
It gets busy late afternoon but I know why now. Im not a Chinese food expert but it's probably one of the best meals I've had in a Chinese restaurant.,1
"So I came here last weekend with 10 people and they seated us still pretty quickly. Our table of five ordered two orders of dumplings, two orders of cripsy noodles, two orders and scallion pancakes, and an order of sauteed rice cakes.

Ending bill plus tip - $11 each! Ridiculous!!! Sooo much food, so good, served piping hot, quick service, in and out in less than 30 minutes. You cannot beat this place.",1
"Best idea for Thanksgiving dinner yet. When we arrived around 6:00 we received #40 as our ticket. Twenty minutes later my daughter and I were seated. While we waited we got to speak to the other people also waiting. Several got in line before realizing Joe's is cash only! 

We ordered the scallion bread appetizer and it was really tasty. For dinner we ordered Shrimp with broccoli. Usually when I've had this dish there's so much broccoli and very little shrimp. Not the case with Joe's. And we ordered sautéed Shrimp. Both came with water, hot tea and white rice. 

All of the food was amazing and the portions were enough for two meals. Great leftovers!!! And the check for $44.00 was not bad at all for a party of two who didn't have dessert or beverage. 

Will be adding Joe's Shanghai to my list of favorites.",1
"Pretty good xiao long bao at a price that was definitely right.

As a tip, they line is sort of long and if it's cold outside that sucks. It was cold outside today.

Don't bother with the pork and crab xlb, they don't use much crab so it doesn't taste appreciably different.

Don't bother with anything besides the xlb. Their spicy fish and cold noodles were pretty meh. not necc bad but like most xlb places this is the only dish they can really make well so don't fight nature, just get that.",1
Got some steamed soup dumplings at the OG. The juice is so thick and savory. Price and ambience is also fun,1
"Wow, who knew soup dumplings could be this HUGE? Not as in the latest rage, but twice the size that I normally have?

My friend and I have a love for xiao long bao, and we trekked through Chinatown for her favorite spot, Joe's Shanghai. It ended up being one of my favorite meals during my 4 day trip in NYC. She had told me there usually is a wait, but getting here around noon on a Saturday, we were seated right away. It's a pretty small restaurant, but has about 20 tables. What weirded me out at first was you share tables. So our table of 5 consisted of 2 parties of 2.

We ordered the scallion pancake and the crab and pork meat soup dumplings. It took some time, but man was it worth the wait! The scallion pancake was PERECT. nicely fried, and not super thin like other places i've had. Ive only had pork XLB's, so the scent of the crab was not so pleasant to me (i like crab though). So I went ahead and ordered the pork ones. Exepct about 10-15 minute wait.

These huge dumplings are oozing with soup and yummy pork filling. Since they're so big, I could not even finish the 8 pieces. I got to about 5, and by then, they were so cooled down that it didnt have that irresistible flavor to me as much anymore. I think if I ate them before the scallion pancake, I would've inhaled them all up like no thing. I believe a set of 8 ranges from $5 to $8 which is not bad! They only have the two options, and it's cash only.",1
Dumplings were delicious. Recommend the crab & pork. Scallion pancakes were my favorite!! Highly recommend,1
"Describing Joe's Shanghai as ""magnificent"" is an understatement. My brother ordered our meal, which consisted of pork steamed dumplings (pictured), string beans, fried rice & pork, and general tso's chicken. Each dish brought a distinct set of flavor that simply can't be replicated. 5/5 stars.",1
Food was great! The servings are pretty large especially the rice. The orange slices at the end of the meal are a nice touch.,1
"Dined: 9-25-18
Lunch

It was raining and we were in Chinatown, very HUNGRY! I wanted to try an authentic Chinese food restaurant because we were in NEW YORK!!  We came across this restaurant and decided to eat lunch.  It was very crowded, so there was a wait.  The host asked if we wanted to share a table with another couple. At first, we declined because we preferred our own table...but after waiting for another 10-15 minutes, we agreed to share. I mean come on, it was pouring outside, we were hungry af, let's just EAT!  We ordered their famous pork soup dumplings, like everybody else in the restaurant. The dumplings were so juicy and flavorful! We also ordered Chicken Lo Mein and Young Chow fried rice for my daughter.  All the food was good. It's pretty packed inside, not much walking space. I don't think my mother could go here with her walker. The waiters were quick and fast talkers. Think of it as crowded, good food, tight places and you're out. Thank you.",1
"Somehow the words Joe and Shanghai doesn't fit together, one may think this is an Americanized Chinese resto?

Certainly not the case!  the service is unfriendly but fast, the tea is boiling hot and prices are dirt cheap.  A big bamboo steamer filled with piping hot tender little pouches filled with meaty broth and pork meatballs -- these are Xiao Long Baos or soup dumplings as everyone knows them by.

Some basic survival tips on how NOT to burn yourself while eating XLBs:
1. Gently lift dumpling to your soup spoon.
2. Bite off a small opening on the side or at the top to open the knot
3. Add 3:1 ratio of soy sauce: vinegar into your soup spoon (thanks Alex L!)
4. Let the soup drain into the spoon (to cool it off) or slurp carefully.
5. Eat and repeat!

I also tried their turnip cake, but that was just a fried ball of grease.  Yuck.

It's best to get here before the lunch rush hour or peak dinner times for maximum enjoyment.  Get it while it's hot!",1
"We got this to go one morning because we didn't want to wait in the long lines. I tired the Pork Soup Dumplings and Green Beans. The dumplings were really good even after being packed in a box for a little while, so I can imagine that they are 10x better when in person. Definitely one of the better soup dumpling places I've been to. Would love to go in person next time!",1
Amazing soup dumplings! Service is very quick and you sit family style. Great way to meet people and have a quick meal. Very inexpensive too.,1
"Ordered delivery on UberEats and was unsure how it would be after the lengthy delivery. It was great! The food arrived and was still very hot & everything tasted as if it was in the restaurant. The hot&sour soup was delicious and very hot (it didn't even need to be heated up in the microwave). We ordered two orders of the soup thinking we would each have one... I don't recommend doing that unless you want a ton of leftovers. One order of the hot & sour soup can easily provide 2.5 servings. The spring rolls were also good and were still crispy (somehow they didn't get soggy with the delivery). We also ordered shrimp fried rice that was a pretty large portion and very good. The shrimp fried rice was not dry at all and hit the spot. The sesame chicken was still crispy and perfect... Joe's thought of a great method to deliver the sesame chicken (they cut out a hole in the plastic lid so the condensation didn't cause the chicken to get soggy) and it worked so well. The entire meal tasted just as good as in the restaurant. Overall, this meal was AMAZING! We are already talking about our next order. Would love to help provide business to this great place especially during covid. We look forward to next time!",1
"We wanted to try soup dumplings and heard great things about Joe's.  Upon arrival, i was a bit turned of by the service and the unpleasant server.  However, the food definitely made up for everything.  We ordered the crispy duck and beef, soup dumplings and noodles.  Everything was heaven in your mouth.  I would have given it 5 stars but the service is horrible.  We had asked our server what he recommended and he looked at us with annoyance and was very unhelpful.  :(",1
"Truly amazing! Joe's is located on a small street in Chinatown. We arrived a little after 5 PM and there was already a 25 minute wait. That's when you know the place is good! 

Joe's looks like your typical Chinatown restaurant. There isn't anything special about the interior, but the emphasis is placed on the quality of their food. Note: they only take cash!

[ Pork Soup Dumplings ] Our group of four ordered four sets of soup dumplings. Each set is served in a dim sum box and comes with 8 soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were bigger than I expected and they spill over the soup spoon. The skin of thick but easy to break apart and the flavor of the soup is deliciously rich. My friend taught me her technique! First, you bite a hole into the soup dumpling and drain the soup into the spoon. Then you dip the rest of the dumpling into the provided vinegar and chase it all down with the soup. 

[ Scallion Pancakes ] Very crispy and oily! These served as great ""sponges"" to soak up any soup that spilled from the soup dumplings.",1
"I came here because I was craving soup dumplings and saw that this place has good reviews.
While I think the soup dumplings were good, with the right amount of juiciness, I was personally not a fan of the amount of ginger they packed in there. I think it obscures the flavor of the meat and soup. Some people might like it that way, it's just not for me.
The other dishes I tried (fried rice, stir-fry noodles,etc.) were good, but not the most amazing
Overall good food, but nothing that stood out among all the great restaurants in Chinatown",1
"Came on a weekend with my husband around 2pm, and it was pretty easy to get seating. The ambiance is clean and big, with high ceilings, with both big and small tables! 

XLB is where it's at here. They're big, juicy, soupy, and delicious! Comes with 8 and they're pretty affordable. I would say they're pretty on par with Nan Xiang honestly. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the other dishes though. We tried the double cooked pork belly, and it kind of just tasted like stir fry with MSG. Not sure if this is because it's the ""Shanghai northern style"" but it kind of just reminded me of just like...a beef and broccoli type dish. Just with pork and peppers and mushrooms. It tasted very American take out style. 

Overall, would most likely just come back for the XLB's here.",1
"My friend was visiting from out of town and mentioned she really wanted soup dumplings, so I did some research and found this place was the highest rated one, and not super expensive, so we went on a Saturday night. They don't take reservations, and I knew it was gonna be insane given we got there a bit before 9, but the restaurant knows the demand is high and they are prepared. They give you a ticket instead of taking names, and call out numbers as soon as enough seats are vacated at the communal-style round tables inside. 

We waited about 25 minutes because bigger parties didn't want to wait very long, so not too bad for a party of 2! Once seated, the service was very prompt, and it needs to be that way in order to get diners in and out, which is why they tack on the service charge to your bill, saving you time. Also, it's cash only, so bring your greens. 

We ordered the pork soup dumplings, which were OMG fantastic. I could probably have just eaten those alone. They give you complimentary tea, which kind I couldn't honestly say, though I thought jasmine. Be mindful with the tongs that you don't squeeze too hard, or the broth inside will seep out before you get to savor it. I picked up the dumpling carefully with the tongs and placed it in my soup spoon, then used a chopstick to make a little hole near the top so I could suck out the broth, then eat the dumpling. I recommend the chili paste with the dumplings if you want a little kick. The dumpling itself is tender and chewy and the pork inside is just right and not too salty. The broth can't be described, you just need to order it and see for yourself.

We got sesame chicken (came with a side of cool broccoli, which after the tea and the soup dumplings, I didn't mind) and kung pao chicken; both of course came with sticky white rice. Both were giant servings. The sesame chicken has a sweet glaze and the kung pao comes with a bunch of peppers. Neither were very spicy.

The place is very snug inside and I would not recommend bringing a stroller, luggage, or lots of bags, so keep that in mind. Other than that, it's a quick walk from the Canal St subway station and is definitely worth the wait! I'll be back!",1
"i think this one is the original. i can't remember. but if its not, its not the good one. there is DEFINITELY a difference b/w joe's shanghai and joe's ginger. i went to ginger last time (if that's the second store) and it was terrible! and it wasn't just one order that i got b/c i got 5 and they were all bad except for 1. that says smoething. wait in line at joe's shanghai, it's well worth it",1
"Has a C rating but we waited amidst crowds of mostly tourists with a good mix of Chinese families and groups for about 30 minutes to get a table. It's communal seating which I loved & the inside is drab and tacky but in the best way possible. We only got fried rice but it was just as good as some of the fried rice I had in China! Overall I would go not only for the good food but also the overall experience. It's super busy and chaotic but worth risking the C rating lol 

Also worth mentioning the food is meant to be shared. We had no idea when we ate there so my brother and I both got our own fried rice & our friend got her own noodle dish. We were the talk of the town for the rest of the table as they were Chinese and didn't speak any English. They visibly made fun of us the whole meal lol. We didn't mind though because honestly when we were in china we got the exact some reactions no matter how much we tried to blend it or how much of the customs we followed or the language we spoke. Felt like being right back in western China lol.",1
"Soupy dumplings (3 stars): they were huge, very soupy, quite tasty, but a little on the greasy side even for soupy dumplings. Very affordable. It is a different technique than DTF. DTF's wrapping is more plastic-y and gel like (which is rather unique and untraditional). These are more bread like, possibly with quite a bit of lard into the wrapping to keep it tender and flavourful. 

Pork chop noodles (4 stars): The pork chops were very well-fried, do ask for it on the side rather than soaking in the soup, though. The dumpling were soupy enough for me to soak my noodles in. Yum.

Scallion pancake (5 stars): the best of all the stuff we had--crispy and beautifully fried.

A very bustling place, I personally enjoyed the chaos, but if you don't, avoid busy hours.",1
"Soup dumplings are amazing! (Xiao Long Bao) I went from Din Tai Fung to this OG spot. No disrespect to DTF but the price for the dumping's here are way better and just as good. We got an order for about $9! We also ordered the Shanghai fried rice and crispy pork chops. The outside part of the dumping was just a little to thick for me but that didn't take away from how good those dumping's were. Fried rice and pork chops were like any other place but still good. Tables were a little too small for all the food we ordered but keep in mind the restaurant is not very big. We came when it was raining and there wasn't a wait but I can only imagine how long the wait is when it's a nice day out. They make it an effort to get you in and out. Also, 15% tip is already included when paying for check.(look on the last page of the menu) Overall, will come back to this place! Cheap food for vacation! (CASH ONLY)",1
"We got here on a weekday lunch time and didn't have to wait for a table of 7! Perfect timing because the restaurant was busy but we got here just in time. We had to share a big table with another party though but that was totally fine.

Everything we ordered was quite delicious.

1. We ordered two juicy pork dumplings. It was a perfect amount to share amongst us. If you compare this to dtf, these are wayyyyy bigger. That means more juice inside the dumplings. The only thing is, you need to get used to picking the dumplings up and onto your plate. My first two attempts were unsuccessful and i disappointedly had to eat them without as much juice left inside. Regardless, it was still delicious!. I love the dumplings with a lot of vinegar and ginger so don't hesitate asking the waiter for more!

2. The mapo tofu without meat was also really good as well. there wasn't really anything that went wrong with this meal. Even without the meat, it had a lot of delicious flavor.

3. The minced pork noodle came with a lot of pork on top. Make sure you mix it around before putting it on your plate. It is pretty saucey. The noodle is different from other places I had this dish from. This place comes with a slightly thicker whiter noodle.. which is pretty good. 

4. The green onion pancake was a very small portion in an order but the crisp of it was perfect and the flavor was very aromatic with the onion cooked into it.. slightly different from other places I had these pancakes from. 

This place was quite delicious! But there are so many Chinese restaurants in this Chinatown area, I would want to explore the other restaurants even though I would also come back here in a heartbeat.",1
"I wanted to experience what the crowds of people waiting for a table at Joe's Shanghai was all about so my husband and I and a friend of ours had lunch there a few weeks ago. Some of the dishes we had were soup dumplings which were perfect in my opinion, cold noodles with sesame sauce (I've had better), clams in black bean sauce which were delicious and a bean curd dish wish our friend liked very much.
It was very crowded but the service was fast and efficient. I would definitely try it again but after growing g up and eating in Chinatown for most of my life, I think there are far better restaurants in that neighborhood.
The ambience is of a typical Chinatown eatery - noisy, crowded but inviting",1
"One never forgets the moment they fall in love with something for the first time. I've read the reviews and although there seems to be plenty of better places to get Xiaolongbao in the world but this was where I lose my soup dumpling virginity.

First of all, there always seems to be a wait but because the staff inside doesn't mess around, your wait will never be as long as you expect it to be. And once you're inside and order the soup dumplings, it won't be long before you're feasting on them.

I didn't know what to expect. My friend tried to explain in words but he just said that I needed to try them. He kept saying Xiaolongbao in a slightly racist accent but after my experience here, I have been doing the same.

The pork ones are around 5 bucks and the crab ones are closer to 7 so for the price difference, I'd stick with the pork ones (they were my favorite anyways). Each order gives you 8 dumplings so order as needed.

I discovered the best way to eat these without burning your tongue or the roof of your mouth is to make a small incision at the top of the dumpling. Once that's done, slowly sucks out the oily soup broth that will change your life forever. Don't be hasty as they are very hot. Once you've sucked out about half of the soup, the other half should be cooled off and you can pop the whole thing into your mouth.

If you've never tried them before, you'll fall in love instantly and be craving them the next day as you sit in your car/bus/train on the way to work.

Last note: CASH ONLY. Xiao for now.",1
"Not much to say about this other than AWESOME soup dumplings! The only thing I find a little weird at first is that you sit with other people but other than that it's a great spot to get your dumpling fix. It's crowded and busy, but it's worth the wait!",1
"If you manage to beat the crowd, do not mind table sharing with strangers, and focus on the xiao long bao ( mini soup buns, bao = buns not dumplings, to be accurate ), the culinary experience will prove worthy. Been here thrice, and midtown location once which offers better seating options

Food: 4.75/5 to the Crab & Pork Xiao long bao - seafood & pork pair off as perfectly as green tea & azuki.

How to Eat: Gently (without poking a hole) lift the bun and place it on the soup spoon, bite off a teeny tiny bit off the top while lifting the bun by chopsticks, and drink away the heavenly fresh (hot! be ware) soup inside - remember you're entitled to slurp during such soupgasm - then drip inside some vinegar and ginger (aids digestion on top of the flavor balance) before devouring the rest of the bun. 

Stuff in as many buns as you can handle, order a small dish of seasonal vegetables stir fried with minced garlic to complement the meat. All other dishes (2/5) are highly NOT recommended. Go elsewhere for noodles or fried rice or dim sum, Joe's Shanghai = Xiao long bao

The dumbest way of eating is to bite into it unstrategically, lose all the soup that is the soul of these buns, and burn your mouth......

Ambience (1.5/5) loud, packed to your elbows, forced to share table with strangers often tourists who stare and ruthlessly knock over their tea or vinegar; be prepared to arrive early in order to avoid the queue 

Service (3/5) efficient, fast, most convenient if you speak Chinese",1
"Came here on a weekday afternoon and there was no wait time. My brother and I split an order of the famous XLB and their salt toasted fish. The XLB came out piping hot and was perfectly soupy on the inside. The salt toasted fish was fried to a perfect crisp, loved the bits. 

We couldn't eat too much this visit because we had dinner reservations later on that evening. The food that was being brought to other tables looked delicious. Service was quick as well.

*cash only",1
"I was brought here by a friend. He's a college student fairly new to the area whose friends are all college students, so naturally I expected that this guy knew nothing what real food was. I was surprised to find that this place was actually really good and sold Xiao Lung Bao. The food was great. 

I'm a little more inclined to give this place a 4 star, but since it was a while ago since I went I'm going to give the place the benefit of the faint memory and give it 5. I remember it was great food, but the price was on the high end. Only restaurants that have food quality that exceeds their price range get 5 stars from me, but like i said benefit of the faint memory.",1
"My husband and I ordered the pork soup dumplings and orange peel chicken. The dumplings were absolutely amazing, and I wish we had just gotten 2 orders of them as our meal. In case you aren't well versed in eating soup dumplings, use a soup spoon!! This way you don't have to balance the dumpling on chopsticks and won't potentially lose the delicious soup due to an unfortunate dumpling tumble. The orange peel chicken was good but not necessarily exceptional. My husband grew up in Seattle where really good Asian food was everywhere, so his standards are very high, so it's not that the orange peel chicken wasn't good, but it's hard to wow him. However, we can't wait to go back for lots of dumplings! 

I also have a several food allergies, and the servers were very helpful and accommodating with that. This is a must-try when you go to NYC!!",1
"I love how piping hot their soup dumplings are every single time.  There's nothing worse than eating a cold soup dumpling and I've had them at other well-known spots in Chinatown.  But never at Joe's.  Their Shanghai Noodles are also fantastic as well as other items.  My usual items are scallion pancakes, General Tso's (I see you judging me, but really...it's really good), and their veggie dishes.  Go early to beat the line!",1
"Joe's hole in a wall.
Shanghai noodle is must to try.
Green string beans was made excellent.
Kung pao chicken is ok if you don't mind it's super spicy. I didn't ask to make it without chilly overload.
If you love peanuts it's a lot in king pao.
Expect to have 2-3 guests on your large round table and have conversation together.
Restroom need to be repaired.
Nobody expected clean restaurant from Chinese fellas. At least believe they wash hands after dirty stuff and removes stickers from complementary oranges before cutting.
Good luck",1
Soup dumplings are amazing but the rest of the food was lackluster. Service was fast. Not worth waiting a long time for,1
"This place usually has a line around the block, but it had been a very rainy night and morning, so it was a miracle to have no line and empty tables at noon! They also have a great machine for rainy days which wraps your umbrella into plastic as you walk in (you are obligated to use it by the staff at the front door who will help you figure it out).

They are famous for their soup dumplings, which are huge! We ordered two trays of the pork and crab and devoured the wonderful broth inside the dumplings that brimmed with crab flavor.

The green beans with garlic was also a table favorite.

My friends indulged me as I asked to order the steamed flounder which was not only beautifully presented, but also delicately cooked.",1
"So delicious! A great experience. Be sure to bring cash.

We had the soup dumplings, the beef with string beans, and the Shanghai fried noodles with chicken. What a feast! We really enjoyed each item and would have liked anything else on the menu, too, I am sure. The tables around us were buzzing and the restaurant filled up quite a lot while we were eating (so did we). The flavors were all so rich and full of umami. Yum, yum, yum! Get there early to be sure you get a table.",1
"Noteworthy xiaolong bao that compare favorably to many I've had in Shanghai, China. Clean and classic decor. Would recommend as an introduction to xiaolong (soup dumplings)",1
"so worth the wait, so amazing. The soup dumplings and crispy beef are not to be missed.",1
"We were seated almost immediately, probably cause it was just 2 people. Fast service and attentive staff. I dropped my chopstick twice  and they gave me a new pair within 10 secs. We got the crab and pork soup dumpling and the pork meat soup dumpling. I honestly thought the crab meat one was better because there was an extra flavor. Though the flavor did remind me of the canned minced crab meat, tasted good regardless, but the reason why I give it 4 stars.",1
"amazing food!! i read reviews saying the soup dumplings aren't anything to rave about, but i thought they were amazing. the portions are family style and perfect for two. the service was excellent! it's well worth the wait.",1
"Love their soup dumplings; #1 in CT...(or maybe NY & US lol) but aside from that, that's pretty much their specialty dish. Had the pork shoulder dish here with my friend one time and it was not my type of food so I didn't really like it. I don't really like their other dishes as well (mainly because they are really really greasy) except for the braised tofu dish with vegetables stuffed underneath or their pepper and pork noodle soup...and that's pretty much it. When I do go back, it is always for their soup dumplings. And everytime you eat, they serve you a small portion of oranges, which is pretty accommodating compared to other regular dine-in in other restaurants. But they do include the 15% tip before hand so do not be mistaken and tip twice, but personally I think it makes tipping easier and less for me because I usually tip more than 15%, but if they're gonna do that, then let it be.",1
"5 star...as good as it gets. the stars are for the crab/pork soup dumplings. frequent visitors to NYC, we love to try new places, and there are so many options.  next visit (next week), we're going back.

We were lucky enough to sit at a table with two sets of Chinese-speaking patrons, who advised ""crab/pork soup dumplings"" and showed us how to eat them.  Truly fantastic and unique flavor. we (the two of us) ended up cancelling what we had ordered and replaced with a second serving.  

Crazy but not chaotic, memorable, the shared table perfect place to get recommendations and help.

Can't wait to return.",1
"Joe's was part of a recent food crawl I took part in through Chinatown,  popped in for a couple of orders of soup dumplings on a Thursday afternoon, and to our surprise found an empty restaurant.

I'm jumping on the soup dumpling band wagon with the least surprising review you're going to read about eating here.....  

The dumplings are perfectly prepared, twenty twists a piece in traditional fashion. The ratio of soup to pork was spot on and each bite was better than the last. 

My only issue with their product is the dumpling sauce, this is purely personal.....  I'd love a bit of vinegar in there for some tang, but that's hardly a blight on a near perfect dumpling experience. 

As good a soup dumpling you'll find, that said I can't speak for anything else on the menu.",1
"Love this place-inexpensive and delicious.  I bring all my friends and family here who come to visit, and now my Dad insists I take him there anytime he visits.  Their soup dumplings are awesome and I also really love their chicken and cucumber with red pepper.  The wait can be ridiculous, so I usually try to get there for right when they're about to open-if not, prepare to stand around for a long time (especially if you have a group of more than 4).  They seat you with random people but that's never bothered me at all, but I do tend to talk a lot.  Definitely an experience.",1
This is a neighborhood spot I love to go to. The food is always good and so is the service. You will have to wait during the lunch rush though so be prepared. I had the soup dumplings. They are a must!,1
"this place lives up to the hype! it's a small place, you may even walk by it, but don't! 

We waited about 30 minutes for a table, which on a saturday at 1pm was expected. Once our name was called we were taken to a big round table which we shared with 10 other people. So, don't expect to have a table all to yourself, as most the tables in here are like that, just a heads up. 

THE FOOD:
fried pork dumplings - huge dumplings and super yummy, I was really pleased with these. nice crunch on the outside and the filling as perfectly seasoned. 
Soup dumplings - probably some of the best I've had! Served steaming hot and none of them broken, which was so nice given that's an easy thing to do
Sesame Chicken - served with steamed broccoli, the chicken was obviously fresh and the sauce was sweet but not overly so
Crispy pan fried noodles with chicken - so we expected this to be a 'dry noodle' dish, like wok seared, but it was a nest of noodles that were deep fried which was SO fun. The basket of noodles was the vessel for wok-ed chicken, broccoli, baby corn, jicama and carrots and as the sauce sat in the bottom the noodles got softer so there was a fun crispy/soft texture going on. we really enjoyed this 

We didnt get dessert cuz we were full, so note that the dishes are HUGE and meant to be shared. If we had each ordered a protein and a side we would have been taking most of it home.",1
"Used to come here a lot with my family when I was a child.  There is always a line, but definitely worth the wait.  The soup dumplings are delicious and well priced.  Their other stir fry dishes are really good too.  Brings back the childhood memory every time.",1
"You just gotta stop by if you're in New York. What else do I say more about the place? 

Oh but dear chef, 
please try not to pop the dimsum so the soup would not leak out of it when we're ready to eat. :(",1
If your come here order a number 1 or 2 thats what they are famous for. Dumplings have soup inside and are always cooked fresh comes with vegetables which I don't eat. If you plan on dining in make sure you havr reservation because the wait can be a while.,1
"Interior--one of those old Chinatown restaurants so it's very cramp, dark and you gotta share tables with strangersthere's no waiting area inside

Service--average. Food comes out pretty fast even when they are extremely busy. They only seat you when your whole party is there.

Taste--the pork dumplings are DELICIOUS and bigger compare with average dumplings. They come out really hot since there's soup in them so make sure don't burn yourself. 

3 of us ordered 4 dishes, came out with a total of $56, which is a pretty good deal considering we were extremely full.",1
"Cheap & Yummy Eats When You Visit NYC!!! First stop is to go there directly after land it and order their delicious pork soupy XLB. It's totally worth it. This place is the OG place and try going during non-peak time to avoid long waits. The place is crowded inside and don't forget to bring your CASH!! And, 15% tips is automatically added to your bill so I guess it makes up for the cheap meals. I order of soup dumping is around $6.95ish comes with an order of 8 big pieces XLB. Super good deal and super delicious. I can tell and taste the Dumpling wrap is handmade and super fresh too! You have to personally go there and experience it :)",1
"Delicious soup dumplings! My family is Shanghainese so I'm always looking for an authentic place for my taste buds. I'm really happy that I found this place to curb my appetite for soup dumplings, which before moving into the city, I've only been able to eat when I'm in Shanghai. 

For sure get the soup dumplings! It comes out in a steaming basket and is super hot so make sure to let it cool a bit. 

This place has a huge line - I was here at 9:30 pm on Saturday and waited 15-20 minutes for a table. You might end up getting seated with another party if you have fewer people.",1
Good soup dumplings. The new location is spacious and clean. Always here for soup dumplings. Will recommend here if your around the neighborhood.,1
"Got the scallion pancake, pork soup buns (XLB), and the Shanghai chow mein. The scallion pancake was divine , so were the soup buns, but would've rather ordered an eggplant dish instead of the noodle dish as there was not much to it.",1
great scallion pancake and fabulous pork buns and pork and shrimp buns.,1
"In the heart of China town, such a cute area. But it gets extremely busy and just be warned you might have to share a table with people you don't know. The food is wonderful! My family and I had the ?vegetable fried rice, the vegetable lo mein, and the fried noodles with beef. All super yummy! My personal favorite was the vegetable fried rice. Prices are very reasonable. Would definitely go back if I was in the area again. Such a cool place! Just wish it was a little bigger.",1
"If you love dumplings, meeting new people and speedy in & out service, this is the place for you! Today we had the pork soup dumplings, General Tao Chicken & Shanghai noodles with my party of 3 and the bill was $40 with tip. The food is fast, looks and tastes delicious and the price point is fantastic -if you stick to water and tea which is complimentary. The seating arrangements allow you to meet new people (as you will be placed at a table with others) and find out about other great restaurants in NYC if you're lucky.",1
"Food was really good, higher priced than other places for sure but understandable due to the popularity. The service was really great, made it all worth it. Shanghai noodles were a bit dry, as was the Shanghai fried rice, but they can bring any sauce requested. Sesame shrimp was nice and crispy, without too much sauce. Scallion pancakes are thick. 

The wait wasn't bad, even with lots of people outside waiting. There were so many people working that everything moved along quickly.",1
Eat soup dumplings here. Eat it while it's hot. Community table. In and out. Not the place to chit chat.,1
"The wait might be long but so worth it! I have only tried Xiao Long Bao a few times at Din Tai Fung in Bellevue, WA but I personally think Joe's Shanghai is a lot better in terms of price and portion size.

My group of 5 split 3 orders of the juicy pork and 2 orders of the crab xiao long baos.  The crab was good but the juicy pork was definitely the favorite of our group.  We also split an order of beef in oyster sauce that was unimpressive.  If anything, just stick to ordering xiao long baos.

A few things to keep in mind:

* You will not get seated until your entire party is present at the restaurant.
* Your party may have to share a table with other strangers (no biggie for me)
* Cash only.",1
"Best soup dumplings 
Other dishes are delicious too 

Our waiter was nice.  

We were a group of eight people.  Waited for 30 minutes on a  busy Saturday night.  Worth the wait.",1
"I was between 4-5 stars because the soup dumplings of course are probably the best I have had. Maybe Marks dumplings in DC and my son had some in LA but said those were the size of Hershey kisses.
These were big and full of soup and the dumpling skin was not too thin or thick. The initial ones will burn your mouth so wait a few seconds. Perfect on a cold winter day. The broth is rich and full of flavor. We ordered 2 crab and one pork- I liked the crab better.
We also had duck- it was good- a lot of skin and a little lean but the skin is our favorite part. The schezwN beef was very good but a little chewy.  Fish was very good and the thick seafood noodles were great.
But I thought the highlight was the dumplings",1
"The soup dumplings and wonton soup are absolutely delicious!  We also ordered General Tsos Chicken was good but a bit on the pricey side compared to the other dishes.  Ordered some beef chow fun which was really good too!  BEWARE:  Cash only.  The place is crowded, you will more than likely have to wait for a table (outside) and may have to share a table.  Also, don't be offended if your server is rude or impersonal.  Lol",1
"Visiting New York for a short weekend trip, this place was recommended from a friend who heard was worth trying for their famous soup dumplings.
Venturing through Chinatown, this was pretty easy to find.  We came here 15 minutes after it opened and did not have to wait from which I heard could be over an hour wait typically.  Small place with about round 15+tables that can accommodate 4-6/table.  We were only a party of 2 and were seated at a table with another group of 3 people.  Was unexpected that we had to dine with strangers but from a business aspect, they want to make good use of space to serve more customers.  
We ordered the famous crab and pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes.   The soup dumplings came out and was piping hot and on a bamboo steamer. Looked impressive.  Took my first bite carefully and ....
Best dumpling I have ever had.  All the right flavors in the broth and the dumpling wrapper almost melted in my mouth GOOD!!!!
The scallion pancake had a hint of scallion flavor with a crunchy shell which was the perfect pairing with the soft dumplings.
I definitely would make time to return again just for the dumplings when I return to New York and would also like to try the other yummy looking Chinese dishes I saw here.",1
"Midtown: Pricey but the crab and pork soup dumplings were great!!

Chinatown: not pricey, huge soup dumplings! We tried the pork, crab and pork, scallion pancake, and Shanghai cabbage wonton soup. Would HIGHLY recommend pork soup dumplings (best in NYC and flushing imho), the rest were not worth getting. Maybe get a veggie plus the pork soup dumplings. 8 per person is a good amount!",1
Used to come to the old spot all the time before they expended to this location. Some of the best (and largest!) XLBs - must try their crab XLBs! Come early to avoid the crowd.,1
"Good Shanghainese food BUT don't come here for the Xiaolongbao. For a place known for Xiaolongbao, theirs really disappointed me because it was so bland and overly chewy. However, the other dishes were great. The scallion pancake was my favorite because it's super crispy and flavorful, but be forewarned that it tastes nothing like the ones you can buy at the supermarket. 

Make sure to come right when the restaurant opens to avoid waiting for a really long time. It's a bit on the pricier end but it's probably worth it. Overall, I would probably come here again but will try other things on the menu.",1
"Just stopped by for soup dumplings and flat noodles    As always, it's an 11 out of 10.  We have XLB at home in the west coat, but these are fatter with better tasting soup and more tender wrappers.  Punchline:  these are the originals for many of us ...",1
"Being from out of town, it's hard to find authentic soup dumplings and these did not disappoint! Food was delicious. Service was speedy. The wait appeared long as there was a line out the line door when we arrived but as a party 2 we were sat immediately. (The line out front was for for larger parties waiting for tables) FYI cash only but there is an ATM on site and parties were not seated until everyone was present.",1
"Shanghai dumplings are great here, so are the other menu items. Don't order too much if you're walking around after dinner, and don't feel like carrying leftovers. Get here early for dinner to avoid the long lines. 5:00 pm on Friday and we got right in with a table of six.",1
"This place has such a strong reputation for a good reason. When you go, do not just order soup dumps! You have to try the other food, including their vegetable dishes and noodle dishes too!
As for the soup dumps, they are delicious, though I find them to be a bit to ""bao-y"" - the skin is thick. I prefer a higher meat and soup to skin ratio personally.",1
"The service was excellent, I got the shrimp lo mein-a nice large portion size- it was tasty! My only issue is with the lack of vegetarian options, I couldn't try any of the specials so I'm not sure this placed lives up to the hype.",1
"Friends of ours took us here, highly recommending the soup dumplings.  I thought, oh yea - I know what dumplings are....yea right.  The Soup Dumplings here are absolutely fantastic, never had anything like that before.  

First you wait, probably outside the door...give your number, and wait some more.  This place is PACKED, but DO NOT stray, it is completely worth the wait, I promise.  We finally got our table, sat family style with other folks.  There were 6 of us, and they fit us in quite nicely.  Everyone gets the same question, what kind of soup dumplings, crab or pork....not, ""do you want soup dumplings"", you're getting them.  And it's a good thing, they are awesome.

I am so glad someone was with us to teach us how to eat these things.  First you put hot sauce in the corner of your plate, take the tongs and pull out a dumplings - place onto your rice spoon, bite a small hole in the top, set the spoon on your plate.  Spoon the hot sauce and the soy/ginger sauce into the hole you bit.  Lift the spoon and suck the soup, it is incredible!  Then bite into the dumpling and eat away.",1
"If you give this place less than 4 stars, you are obviously crazy and don't take food seriously!  The best soup dumplings I have EVER had.  

The best time to go is on a weekday, after 2pm or very late.  The cheese line is serious at this place. Wear comfortable shoes and jogging pants for the extra space you'll need once you're done eating here.  

When I'm done eating here, I feel like a fat baby, and ready for a nap.",1
"There's a huge line out the door all the time because this place is as good as it gets!

Since there are such long lines, the restaurant tries to fill up all the seats at a table. Our group of 3 was seated with 2 other groups of 2 and 3. A little awkward but totally worth it for the delish soup dumplings!

We ordered the crab dumplings and pork dumplings. These are probably the best soup dumplings I've ever had outside of Shanghai. The dumplings are rather large but made fresh-to-order. It comes out steamy hot and tasty!",1
"Super top delicious crab and meet soup dumplings, I read and heard that they are famous for those. So don't miss them!
Also the shrimps steamed dimplings and the fried pork dumplings are really delicious.
We also had the shrimp wonton soup but because they need a bit more time for the preparation, we had them at the end and, being of a more delicate flavour, tasted a bit less. Be sure to have this soup first and I am sure it will be great.
Ah, we also had the Mei Fun noodles (spicy curry, dry panfried) and they were very giod too.
Service is fine, tables are round to share.
It was pretty packed, so no much space for pictures this time. 
Also make sure you are not sturving when you go, because there might be a long queue to wait. Unless you are very lucky...
Price is fair, 40$ in two and we ate really a lot. No credit card.",1
"Last month I ventured into the big apple with my partner in crime and indulged in some tasty morsels. One treat that particularly stood out was the concoction of pork and dough from Joe's Shanghai. As you cautiously take a bite of the hot dumpling, its deliciously fatty contents trickle down your throat and into your stomach. We left fully satisfied and continued on our food-venture.",1
"Never had soup dumplings before this place, and im in love. Theres always a line everytime ive gone for good reason. Food is amazing, cheap, and i like the communal round table seating. Dont order the bean curd, looked and tasted like. The spicy cabbage is great and the 2 soup dumpling orders are enough for two people.",1
"Went on a Sunday for lunch in the winter and there was no line. The crab soup dumplings is a must, even if you don't like crab get them!! The orange beef was delicious and spicy which I liked.",1
"We came for an early dinner on a weekday and there was no wait time. Of course we ordered some xiao long bao/ Shanghai dumplings / soup dumplings / little dragon buns. We also got some scallion pancakes and fried pork dumplings. Everything was delicious and nostalgic, and not so nostalgic.
While these soup dumplings from Joe's Shanghai are delicious, they are very different from the xiao long baos I am used to eating. I'm not a xiao long bao / Shanghai dumpling snob, but I've been eating these dumplings ever since I could consume solid food. They just aren't 'authentic.' I hate using the A word, because it's so vague and meaningless. Food trends and even food traditions are changing all the time. 

In my opinion, these are the deviations from a typical soup dumpling. 
- Super-sized type dumpling. Each dumpling is nearly the size of a small burger. 
- The flavor of the meat filling also tastes a little different, could use more flavor.
- The skin is too thick. 

What I do like: 
- The meat in each dumpling is a generous amount
- There is plenty of soup encased in each one, 
- Very good price, so I did walk away feeling full and satisfied.

It is a cash only establishment, so once again, I have to plan out a visit to the ATM first. Just an extra step that cuts into my eating time. I'd still come back for some very affordable, extra large dumplings again.",1
The best crab dumplings i have ever had. I have been here several times and every time the food is super phenomenal. If u are traveling and want to go to a good authentic Chinese restaurant then u MUST go here . My fav restaurant to go in NYC !,1
"Great crab and pork soup dumplings. Lots of filling and the price is definitely worth it. The cold noodles and vegetable dumplings were also delicious, but their soup dumplings were just superb. Service was fast and the waiters were attentive.",1
"The steamed pork dumplings here are legendary. I get random cravings about them and when I go I'm never disappointed. Great service, love the atmosphere and the food is always delicious. 5 STARS!",1
I wish I lived in NYC!!! I crave the soup dumplings all the time and nothing comes close in the Bay area,1
"wow-i've never meet so many a-holes in such high concentration in one place here in nyc EVAR!

they scream at you, order you around, and degrade you at any chance they can. they won't let you enjoy your meal at a reasonable pace with your companions before they start kicking you out. 

DAMN waiters!

they know their xiao long bao is the best in the city (but not as good as http://www.yelp.com/biz/din-tai-fung-arcadia-3#hrid:l3F-7BMk81AZSzzmBeMaSw/src:search/query:xiao long bao). they are pretentious and stare at you to speed your meal at every chance. i had the flat noodles with pork to accompany my dumplings. 

BE CAREFUL with the dumplings--they will explode in your mouth and not in a good way! pierce the skin and suck the pork juice, add sauce, and enjoy!

back to the review. we didn't finish our meal and i was scared  that our boxed takeout was going to have a little aqqq-choo sauce!!!! :$

remember that there is grat included and if you feel generous, tip these well oiled machines of waiters and don't let them get to you.",1
"The good:
- Amazing soup dumplings.
- Great food in decent prices.
- Round communal tables make it perfect for groups.
- And of course the BYOB policy!

The bad:
- It's the Chinese version for Seinfeld' soup natzi. Expect very rude service
- Far from everything else and long lines",1
"I took my childhood friend who was visiting from my tiny hometown.  We had a great weekend.   Of all that we did this, Joe's Shanghai was what she loved most.  We had a great group of strangers at our table, the dumplings are amazing, not to mention everything else we had.",1
Soup dumplings galore! Can not get better than this. Also we had the sesame chicken and Singapore thick noodles. Couldn't finish it all but always come to joe's for our Chinatown fix when we are in NYC.,1
"The food comes out pretty fast and you can make RSVP. we had a group of 12 or so and we were able to be late and get seated pretty fast. The pork and soup dumplings were good, eggplant dishes were good but maybe too much sauce, the babyshrimp dish came with huge portion, both the pork and chicke rice cakes were really good, we also got the giant meatballs which were good, etc. The food came out to be $13 a person and we ate sooo much even though we were starting with the 8 crates of soup dumplings.",1
"Food was amazing and so,so fresh. The lines are ridiculous because the food is so good. However me and my co workers didn't have to wait . Get there knowing you are gonna wait but it is beyond worth it. They treated us very nice. The dessert was AWESOME. The scallion pankcakes were delicious..",1
Best soup dumplings you can find in NYC outside of Flushing. Delicious! The indoor ambiance makes me feel like I am in China,1
"Had to wait to get seated, took 25 minutes. The restaurant was crowded, loud and crazy. Seating is family style with a lazy susan on the table. Food was pretty good. The highlights were the pork soup dumplings, the turnip buns, jellyfish and fried quail. Place only takes cash and prices are good.",1
"Having heard so much about Joe's Shanghai I had to try their Soup Dumplings! I arrived on a Tuesday at 1:30pm and unsurprisingly there was a huge crowd of people waiting outside. I stepped inside to get a ticket (don't lose this!) from the lady and that was when the true test of patience began. Since I was by myself, I was told that the wait would be about 30 min which turned into an hour. Pretty long if you ask me for a single person, but clearly there were many larger parties in front of me who had already been waiting just as long if not longer. 

Once seated, I already knew I only wanted one thing: the Crab & Pork Soup Dumplings (XLB)! While waiting, I got a chance to see the interior which was modern and very clean. As soon as the XLB arrived I could feel all of my excitement as my mouth drooled in anticipation. Upon opening the bamboo lid, a huge plume of steam escaped revealing 8 of the largest soup dumplings I have ever seen! Somehow these delicate pouches of joy were able to hold all of the delicious and fatty pork broth that completely coats the inside of your mouth. The crab/pork filling was very meaty and tasty while the skin was thin. The top was a bit too chewy, but overall a very satisfying XLB. 

Overall, the XLB is top notch and is quite comparable to what I have had here in the Bay Area for those who have had Din Ding Dumpling House. I'd say Joe's Shanghai is slightly larger and fattier so you definitely get more bang for your buck. Only downside is that it is cash only. I don't think I'd wait here again by myself, but would certainly be willing to come back with a group of friends to try more things as a group.",1
"Joe's is definitely not your standard traditional Chinese restaurant.  First thing I noticed - neon pink and green lights adorning the ceiling...majorly tacky and I felt like I was in one of those really shitty whitewashed Chinese restaurants.  Second thing I noticed is the clientele - you have a very wide diversity of people eating here, likely because it has become so popular.  A rainbow of ethnicities, some dressed as bums, some in suits, Joe's attracts people of all backgrounds.  To maximize efficiency, they have it set up that wherever they can sit you, they will.  This usually means sharing large 12 person banquet tables with 3-4 other parties.  Very interesting in that you get to meet a lot of different people, but definitely unheard of in Chinese restaurants.

As for the food, it did not disappoint.  The soup dumplings are decent but lacked that juicy explosion in your mouth.  Frightening though to see so many noobs tear it apart, bite into it, or just plain mishandled these little bundles of joy and leave all the soup on their plate.  Absolutely taboo.  However, the stir fried rice cake here is the best that I have ever had.  So underrated.  Ppl need to bow down to this more than the xiao long bao.",1
"So my sister use to go to school in New York and whenever it would come up in a conversation she would go, ""But Joe's shanghai, you have to go there! The dumplings have this delicious broth! You can't just have one order.""

Finally, I decided to go to NY to visit my friend and after years about hearing of Joe's from my sister I made it a priority to go there! 

Luckily when we went we were seated right away. They sit you at a round table and if you're party doesn't fill they table they fill it with other guests. Not as bad as it sounds, just don't be shy! Good food is definitely an ice breaker. 

Our food was placed on our table and I found myself at a pause. I was afraid that it was overhyped, so I tried my best to lower my expectations. 
Took a bite into a xio long bao, smiled and did that little wiggle, YOU KNOW, that little happy dance you do after eating something really yummy!

Sometimes I find myself sitting in Din Thai Fung in LA and remembering that glorious trip to NY where I blessed my taste buds with Joe's Shanghai!",1
"Best in all of NYC

Amazing authentic experience , in China town no less

Good vibes
Must get soup dumplings **",1
"I really love the soup dumplings here. They are just freaking awesome. I've tried many dumpling spots all over the five boroughs. I just love all sorts of dumplings from all over the world but I must say this is the best soup Chinese dumplings I've had in years. I've been to this spot more than 3 times and I order just the dumplings. They are super cheap and the juice is just heaven when it pours in my mouth. 
The only drawback is there is no drawback. I haven't tried any other food here and probably will not because the dumplings are just too good to pass on. 
I see a lot of people order other food items here but I do t really see t point since the dumplings will just devour your tastebuds!
The wait is a little long during peak hours that is around 5-8pm it'll die down after that. But if you are solo or just 2 then it shouldn't be a problem. Groups are freaking hard to get a spot. 
Love the dumplings....",1
"One if my all time favorite joint for soup dumplings. I'm a native Shanghainese, growing up eating Xiaolong Bao, this is about as authentic as it gets, also very reasonably priced. I much prefer the flavor here then of Ding Tai Feng, which is way over priced, and just OK  tasting.",1
"Great chinese.  Famous for their soup dumplings -- and for good reason!  I also love their noodle dishes (especially the fried noodles).  They have a really good beef with jalapeno dish that's a must if you love (very) spicy food (it's sometimes a special but not on the regular menu -- but they will make it if you ask for it .

Cash only and typically 30 minute wait or so.  Everyone sits at big round communal tables which adds to the overall experience.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is hands down the best place in NYC for soup dumplings. The soup dumplings here are the best. The dumpling skin is thin and the soup is very flavorful and the bits of pork inside it makes this dumpling so perfect. When it's very hot I usually poke a small hole in the dumpling and pour out the soup on the spoon and mix a splash of vinegar. I also really like the fried dumplings, and the Shanghai Fried Rice. In the fried rice, they have broccoli, eggs, and some scallions. It sounds plain but it taste amazing. The wait is long and as soon as you sit down the waiters will ask you how many orders of dumplings you want and they come arrive very fast-usually about 5 minutes. Also you do have to be seated with other parties and space is tight. But the food is great and well worth the wait.",1
Of course the downside of this place as many people come to realize is the rudeness of the waiters and management but we all keep coming back because the food is good. My friends and I do a monthly soup dumpling outing to Joe's because it's just the best comfort food. And its cheap!,1
"Many believe that Joe's Shanghai has the best soup dumplings in New York City. Personally, I like the soup dumplings at Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao (38-12 Prince St, Flushing, NY 11354) in Flushing slightly more. Nevertheless, I would not argue with anyone that goes with Joe's. Their soup dumplings are legitimately that good. While the dumplings are definitely the star dishes, the other dishes are very solid too. I really enjoy the cold cut meats and jelly fish as another appetizer. The rice cake entrée dishes are excellent. The pan fried noodles are very good too.

Joe's has two more locations: one in midtown Manhattan and the other in Flushing. I have been to the midtown location many times. Of course, it is more expensive because it is midtown. In addition, the Pell Street location has the better food. It is usually packed and there I usually a wait. Joe's Ginger is on the same block. It is not affiliated and the food is not comparable. As a result, I would either wait for Joe's Shanghai's soup dumplings or abstain from soup dumplings. From personal experience, I have eaten at Joe's Ginger, confused it for Joe's Shanghai, and sullied the good name of Joe's Shanghai by saying it was overrated.

"Good spot, great value.  
It's tucked away off of Canal street but worth the walk.  Customer service is ok, considering its China Town.  
Family of 5 ate comfortably for $62.00. Would definitely come back.  
We had the sesame chicken, pork fried rice and fried dumplings.  Would highly recommend all of those.",1
"The long line with tickets for seating is evidence of the quality of the food. Two friends and I ordered the xiao long bao, citrus prawns, kung pao chicken, and eggplant - all delicious and in generous portions! Our leftovers made a big lunch for me the next day.

Be prepared to share a table with 2-3 other groups. The environment is loud and crowded, so you know that everyone enjoys the food.",1
"This restaurant is pretty big and fits a great amount of people. I was surprised to see that majority of the people that dined here were tourists and we were lucky enough to sit in the last few tables. This restaurant only accepts cash and they have an ATM machine right at the front of the entrance. I wouldn't say that this place was amazing and one of my top goto places for soup dumplings but it is pretty decent here. The fried dumplings are great and my friend who does not like fried dumplings actually really enjoyed the ones from here. The soup dumplings had a good amount of soup in them. The beef fried rice was pretty good as well and there was a good portion of meat inside. They do include about a 18% service charge in your bill and all the waiters are extrmely patient and attentive. 

There are many different ways to eat soup dumplings for those that are not too sure how to eat them and are reading my review. First off, it is really hot once you lift the lid off of the bamboo steamer. Use the tongs that they give you or your chopsticks and grab the very tip of the soup dumpling that sticks out the most. Then place is onto the spoon.
1. You can just eat it as a whole but will most likely burn yourself if you do not wait for it to cool off. 
2. Take a bit off the tip of the dumpling and you will see that inside there's a ball of meat and soup surrounding it. (At this point you can either add a spoonful of the sauce that they provide, which usually consists of soy sauce/vinegar/ginger, inside the dumpling or not have sauce at all) Wait for it to cool off and then eat as a whole or you could drink the soup first then eat it. 
3. Another way is taking a bite of the tip of the dumpling and pour the soup out onto the spoon.
There are many different other ways to eat a soup dumpling but just make sure to let it cook off a bit because you will get burned. I've made many mistakes in the past hahaha.",1
"Family style which was super surprising, but ended up being fun. Really great food- soup dumplings were just like the homemade ones I had in China. Everything was perfect. 10/10 will definitely go again.",1
"Such a lively place! Always full when we go, fast moving, getting you delicious food fast.  We love loved the giant soup dumplings, so good!",1
"It's been years since I've been to Joe's. Last time I ate at Joe's was at the old location. I got take out which was still amazing.  The crab & pork soup dumplings had an explosion of flavor with each bite. Even in a takeout container the soup dumplings had a perfect consistency & were so flavorful. 
This was the first time I had the scallion pancakes. Again a perfect consistency & full of flavor.  Shrimp Lo Mein had an abundance of small shrimp. 
While I missed the hype & vibe of the old location, the food was as amazing as I remember it to be.",1
"Love the new space - a very modern and exciting vibe. The wait is intimidating. We were quoted 1h40min and that's almost exactly how long it was. It was certainly worth it. They were still working on getting their liquor license as of 12/25, but it's a pretty basic selection of beers. That's not the reason you're here. The real reason is absolutely the soup dumplings. I had never eaten them before so I popped the first one into my mouth and scalded the entire thing. After I figured it out I was able to enjoy them and found myself wishing I had 24-36 more to eat. This was followed up by the general Tso's chicken which was without a doubt the best I have had. Perfectly crispy on the outside, delicate and flavorful on the inside, and a nice lingering spice of medium intensity. It is cash only and the prices are more than fair. By the end of the meal you will forget all about how long you waited.",1
"This restaurant lived up to my expectation. The XLB was better than Din Tai Fung in San Jose. The size was good, bigger than San Jose DinTaiFung. They also had a good amount of crab for each XLB. The fillings were pretty flavorful, too. The crab flavors did stood out. 

The XLB soup was fatty (not oily), and had lots of meat flavors. Lots of Napa cabbage too. Probably the best XLB i've had in the U.S

I also ordered the Yang Chou fried rice (fried rice w peas, chicken, eggs), which was also very good. I had more than half of it togo. $24 in total for this meal and it fed me more than 2 meals. Great deal!

CASH ONLY.",1
One of the better dim sum places in manhattan if you can't make it out to queens. It gets crowded on weekends at all times with long wait times so if you have a large group you will have to wait if you go at peak hours. We always get a large variety of dishes and always leave full !,1
"My quest for the best xiao long bao has brought me a long way from my home in Hawaii...... all the way to Manhattan's Chinatown. I was here on vacation (I used to live here and consider it my home) and browsed Yelp, of course, to look for a place to eat soup dumplings. A few reviews stated that Joe's Shanghai was very good, although touristy. Hmmm.... I was staying in the Village so Chinatown was close by. Why not? My best friend from my early NYC days and I hopped in a cab and off we went.

I'm happy to say that when we went today, it was not filled with tourists. In fact, it was filled with a lot of locals, which is always a good thing. We were promptly seated and brought glasses of hot tea, which were so good on this cold February morning. We ordered turnip cakes, scallion pancakes, pork pan fried dumplings, and pork xiao long bao. Where do I begin to describe how delicious the food was? The turnip cakes were crunchy on the outside, soft and almost creamy in the middle, and a very good start to our wonderful meal. Our server quickly brought out the scallion pancake and pork dumplings. Scallion pancake is a must have - nicely crispy with a deliciously mild scallion flavor. The black vinegar complemented this perfectly. Pork pan fried dumplings were also a hit, with a crunchy exterior and deliciously moist interior, with lots of pork flavor. Our last dish brought out was the pork xiao long bao. This beats any of the XLBs I've had in Hawaii. Very juicy, with hot, flavorful soup that you slurp up after you poke a small hole in the side of it, then add chili oil or black vinegar and enjoy the heavenly pork filling. What an outstanding dining experience! I hope to come back on my next trip to NYC, which will be in a few months. Other tables were having fried rice, noodles, chicken and beef dishes, but there were only two of us and we didn't have the stomach space, so sadly the amount of food we could eat was limited. I give this place a well deserved, solid 5 stars.",1
The fried dumplings were the best I've ever had. It is a must go place. The table style is communal which is great for meeting new people. I loved my time here!,1
"I come with a bunch of friends for dinner. This was the last to-eat item on our trip to NYC. I sit down, the waiter comes over and asks if we want any dumplings. Obviously it's because it takes some time to steam. There's 6 of us. I say I want 4 orders...my friend stare at me. Fine, fine...change it three orders.

We order other dishes, here and there as well. The crab XLB comes out, and everyone LOVES it. No one can have enough. And I'm like, duh that's why I wanted 4 orders. My sole purpose of going to Joe's Shanghai is for the crab XLB. It's awesome, and you can't get anything else like it from CA. The rest of the menu is so-so. Nothing to write home about. Nothing to rave. It is what it is. BUT THE CRAB XLB. That's all you need yelpers. It'll change your taste buds. Promise.

Now our friends also asked why the Chinatown location, why not the one in midtown? And obviously Flushing is too far. Chinatown because (a) it's cheaper and (b) you get two more pieces than Midtown!",1
"5 star food, 2 star service. The servers are a bit rude and you have to share tables but the food is honestly worth it. Try #1 on the menu ! Amazing xiao long baos. The fried rice is also pretty good! Definitely try it at least once.",1
The soup dumplings were a delight. Pan fried noodles were OK... The wait was long but it was a Sun...,1
"This is classic New York Chinese, it's very hard to find this in other parts of the country. The soup dumplings were amazing- good in size, but also having a dumpling skin that doesn't spill easily. (Many soup dumpling places have dumplings that break as soon as you pick em up). The flavor of the dumpling was fantastic too- it had a little bit of crab roe flavor combined with the classic pork filling. The wait was not too bad either, we waited about 10 minutes for a party of 3 on a weekend.",1
"I have been craving this food since the year 2000, when I was first introduced to this cozy crowded habitat. My friends were crazy for the  dumplings, but my taste buds went wild for the Pan Fried Chilean Sea Bass ! Oh my Godddd!!! Hope it's still the same when I visit this year...yeah, I'll write another review in May 2008 after 'I'm back.
 One thing I discovered about New York...the good food joints usually have a line outside.",1
"5 Stars for the soup dumplings alone. 

The quality of food is perfect and affordable.  I would definitely go back again.",1
"tasty XLB (steamed soup dumplings).   fatty, piping hot and affordable.

come here for the soup dumplings (pork or pork and crab) and perhaps an order of shanghai noodles (stir fry) or scallion pancakes.  tried other dishes through the years and trust me they are not memorable and not worth the cash nor calories.  
 
do not expect good service, they are abruptly efficient.  likely reason why 15% gratuity is already added to the bill.  zero ambiance.  expect lines.  and yes, despite all this I am still a fan.",1
"Joes shanghai has the best soup dumplings I have ever tasted. I have tried their crab soup dumplings and their pork soup dumplings and both were AMAZING. This is the perfect thing to eat on a cold day. This is the perfect thing to eat on anyday. Inside the dumplings is liquid soup with crumbles of soft meat inside. It all, sort of, comes together in harmony once in your mouth. It is a must try, very memorable food that will create an experience that will last a life time.",1
"I never write reviews but this place was amazing. great service and even better food. had pork soup dumplings for the first time in my life, and I don't think I'll ever forget that first bite. a must if you're in China town!",1
"this was my first experience with xiao long bao and it won't be my last.  
i was visiting a friend in nyc last weekend and she took me to joe's shanghai...it was a friday afternoon (around 3pm) and there was no wait (but we shared a table with another party since there were only two of us)
we split the soup dumplings, scallion pancake and fried pork dumplings...our bill came to less than $20..

their scallion pancakes were tasty and addicting...the pork dumplings were good, too...but the best part were the soup dumplings..
they were amazing.  

go and try them. now. 

if i wasn't here in houston, i'd be there slurping the goodness that is in their soup dumplings.",1
I have died and gone to dumplings heaven .  If given the option I would seriously consider trading my first born son for some crab dumplings . The service is the only thing holding me back from giving this dumpling house 5 stars .,1
"Came here twice, once eat-in & once to-go.

EAT-IN -- 5 stars
They sit you wherever there's space, so we sat with like 2 other parties. Relatively little wait because of that, which I appreciated. We got one order of pork xiaolongbao & one of crab. Both were SOOO good and hot and juicy, totally worth the craziness. Quite filling for boyfriend & me. They churned these babies out fast too, so we were in and out like *that*. AMAZING experience.

TAKE-OUT -- 3 stars
Told my parents this place was amazing, so we had to get some xiaolongbao even though we were in a hurry. They weren't nearly as good when you're not eating them superfresh, and I was a little embarrassed. We didn't even save that much time since the xiaolongbao took longer for takeout I guess. BOOo.. lesson learned.",1
"5stars for Pork dumplings, the rest 3stars, hence 4stars for average.
I would suggest sticking with pork over crab or you can be like the other newbs and try them for yourself then settle for pork in following visits. The dumplings are served 8 at a time, after having a few, you will understand why tea is served, to counter the fatty soup within the dumplings. Having said that, pork dumplings are delicious, the best around.
This place does require an overhaul. Service, cleanliness, and waitlist system can all be improved. Service is more of an obligatory requirement here, not sure who the client is. Cleanliness, look for yourself. Waitlist, often 3 parties are thrown in together on one table, I barely enjoy eating with my kids never mind strangers!
Ultimately, this place is popular because the pork dumplings over come all the minuses and more.

The Next Time:
Go for early dinner or late dinner. Prime time does not work here unless you know the owner. Do not take kids. Skip the crab dumplings and stick with the pork dumplings.",1
Well known with good food. Felt rushed.,1
"Wow, this place is quite the attention getter. My bf and I waited about 20 minutes to get seated? We walked around China town while waiting so it wasn't so bad.
We sat family style with other people but on our own separate tab. Kind of crammed but it's okay. Anything to get seated fast and food in our belly! 
We ordered the regular pork XLB, crab/pork XLB, and their crispy noodles w/ beef. 
The crab/pork XLB was so so so good & flavorful!! Also, the crispy noodles were diffferent than we ever had. We didn't really eat much of it because we got full since the XLBs were so big. The price to portion ratio was so worth it & so affordable I think.

What changed the game to us was later in the evening when we ate our crispy noodle leftover, all the juices had soaked up and man ..... it was sooooo good. I enjoyed it that way better than fresh & crispy! It's because their noodles are like poofed rice noodles. I can't explain it but the texture and taste was a 10/10. I'd come back when in NY!! I think they are moving locations soon???",1
"Review is only for the not so xiao, xiao long baos! Really though these are some of the hugest xlb dumplings I've ever had and coming from California I've been to tons of Chinese restaurants in my lifetime.

The pork ones are pretty good but the pork/crab ones are soooooo juicy and delicious. Highly recommend springing for the crab ones because they're wayyy more flavorful and they actually do put a good amount of crab. They add some yummy steamed shredded cabbage which is nice because most places don't give anything with their baos.

I liked the crab pork dumplings so much I came back two more times in my one week in NY. Nothing else on the menu really impressed me in addition to the fact the prices for everything else seemed too high.

Still will keep coming back and doing my takeout bao orders when I'm in NY.",1
"So after we ate at another place, we order some for to go back to our apt. Not a big dumpling fan but the dumplings at this place was delicious! So soft and the juice inside of it was to die for!",1
"I was blown away by the food at Joe's Shanghai. I will admit, I was a little thrown off by the name when a friend informed me that that's where we were headed, but as soon as I turned onto Pell Street and saw the crowd waiting outside on a MONDAY NIGHT, I knew any reservations I might have had were obsolete.

We were there with a large group...there were eleven of us. While we did have a bit of a wait, it wasn't nearly as long as I was expecting. A couple of people actually went for a 20 minute massage right across the street while we waiting, and we ended up missing our table and having to wait a little longer!

Even with that, the wait wasn't that bad. We were all able to sit around a big table, which was a little cramped, but not anything I'm not used to. The hardest part was being left handed and sitting next to a rightie, and having chop stick battles all night.

Of the group of us, there was only one person who had eaten there before. As a result, she took charge and ordered a bunch of dishes that everyone could share, which really was the best way to do things. And even though we had 3 vegetarians at the table, everyone left full. The service was great, too! I think, at times, we had up to four people waiting on our table. They all helped each other out. And they stayed totally in the background, which is the goal of waiting a large group.

I think the best part was the price. There were 11 people in our party, everyone left full, we had an entire bag full of boxes of leftovers, and the check broke down to $12 a person, including tax and tip. For the sheer amount and quality of food, I was blown away by the low price. I couldn't even count how many dishes were ordered!

I'm definitely going to be coming back here. I was very impressed by this restaurant all around. I'd definitely recommend it.",1
"One of the best dumplings and Chinese food in general. There's few locations and I've heard the China Town one was the best. 

The only thing I was a bit annoyed was that they didn't call our number or thought we weren't there and waited extra 15-20mins....good thing the food was delicious ha. I'll definitely come back. 

Things I ordered:
- shanghai noodles 
- pork soup dumplings
- kung pow chicken",1
"Had 'em in Shanghai, had 'em in L.A., had 'em in Toronto, had 'em at Joe's Shanghai in Manhattan.  The best is at Joe's Shanghai.  

The amount of soup in one dumpling is incredible, and the fact that the soup does not break the thin dumpling skin is a skill only known to a select few.  Knowing how hard it is to make these puppies makes eating them so much more enjoyeable.  

Indulge, eat as many as you can and then take a long nap.  When you wake up, congratulate yourself, and thank me for having saved you 2k in airfare to Shanghai.",1
Rude service..but with food this great..who gives a damn! Definitely worth the 40 min wait.,1
Been here multiple times. Love the soup dumplings. Great options for Vegetarians as well. Regular joint,1
"This place has one of the biggest and juiciest xiao long bao I have ever had. We ordered pork soup dumplings, pork and crab soup dumplings, vegetable lo mein, and shanghai noodle soup. My favorite was the pork soup dumpling; the skin was thin yet it still held onto the soup very well. The vegetable lo mein and shanghai noodle soup was okay. If I come here again, I would stick to the xiao long bao.",1
The line outside is a but intimidating when you first get there however they are pretty efficient with getting you seated quickly. I am visiting from San Diego and my friends showed me this place and I'm glad they did. Dumplings that inside it has soup?!? Like WHAT.. Haha had to try. Got the scallion pancake BOMB.. The dumplings are really good got the pork and it's actually really filling. The chicken fried rice with soy sauce was really good.. I feel like anything you order would be really good.Service was average nothing amazing. Had to ask for more water a lot but definitely is worth a shot and be ready to wait.,1
Absolutely lived up to the hype!!! Cash only so make sure you have a good amount. A lot of fun to go to with a big group or just a couple people. Soup dumplings are a must and the general tso's was sick too,1
"Ok. 4 stars only because when I walked down the block there was a less famous place with cheaper soup dumplings. AND because I don't like to sit with strangers who talk about eating cats and dogs while I eat...

ANYWAY, took my brother and his girlfriend here when they were visiting from Miami. Very friendly staff. Short wait, because we sat with other people. Dumplings were pretty good.. Not great. But I don't have much to compare too. I will let you know later.... but it was worth it.",1
The food tastes like any other average restaurant you can find in other places but it's still good. It wasn't a wow experience to me even though I heard so much about them. They also have very big portions. The pictures below were shared by 3 people and we couldn't really finish it all.,1
best soup dumplings ever the rest of the food is good but the soup dumplings man so so so so so so so so so so so so so good,1
Came in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday just for the soup dumplings. Had to wait about 10 minutes but it was so worth it. All the food coming out around us looked amazing-- I will definietly be back.,1
"How do you get a vegetarian to eat their pork? Send 'em to Joe's Shanghai! WOW, their dumplings (xiao long bao, or XLB), are amazing. There's no need to look at the menu. Just order the crab dumplings (crab and pork mix) and you're set! Hear that-- the CRAB dumplings. It tastes so much better w/ the crab. 

The trick is how to eat them. It's actually a delicate procedure: pick up the dumpling GENTLY from the bamboo steamer. Don't go all crazy or you'll poke a hole and spill all the yummy juices. Once you've picked it up, put it on your spoon and tilt the spoon sideways, balancing the dumpling in place with your chopsticks. Then, nibble a tiny hole in the dumpling skin and suck out the juice- delish! That is actually the best part of the XLB. 

And don't act all weirded out that you're sitting at a communal table. Space is at a minimal in here, so don't get all huffy you can't get a private table. Expect a 30-45 minute wait for seating. But it is SO worth it. We went here twice in a 2 day span and would have come more if we had the chance. This is a MUST visit whenever you're in the area.",1
"Ventured here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and was glad we did!

**First and foremost: they only accept cash!!!** (We never carry more than $10-$20 in cash, so we had to stop across the street in a pharmacy and pull out cash from the ATM there.)

So, we headed back over. It was pretty busy around the lunch hour, but we were seated right away. Just as others have mentioned, if you are 2-3 people coming, you will be sat at a cozy table with strangers. It was fine for us, but I know some people may not prefer that dining style. The interior is older and overall, it was pretty cramped, but we were there for the food. As a side note, the pics others posted on here were helpful because the menu is very simple and contains no pictures or detailed descriptions.

They give you your own little pot of tea, which is always a nice touch. We couldn't wait to order the pork soup dumplings. They arrived quickly and were everything I had hoped for and more! We actually ended up sharing with the others at our table because we still had 2 main dishes coming out.

My husband loves trying different bizarre things, and tried the cold appetizer of kidney and vegetables. It was actually not bad. It had a little too much of a game meat taste for me to want more, but it was tender and kind of reminded me of Buffalo or venison. I wouldn't order it again, but hey, it was worth trying something out of my comfort zone!

I ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken. This portion is huge...like, 2-3 people could easily share this and be full, especially if you've had the dumplings to start with. I loved these noodles! It was my first time having them, and they easily soften up in the sauce, but the crunchy bites were also perfect.

My husband ordered ginger chicken. This didn't come out like we had expected, but was delicious nonetheless. Just know, that the chicken with this dish isn't nicely chopped up for you, but instead is the whole chicken pieces with the meat still attached to the bones and the skin is still in tact. 

The service was very quick, even on a busy Saturday afternoon. I def will go back next visit to NYC!",1
"Packed to the tits, but the food is so fire. The prices are good and I love the communal seating. Made some new friends. Even if you're a vegetarian the food is gooood. Serving sizes are big so bring your tupperware and your other stomach.",1
"Have heard a lot about this place so it was a must visit during our last trip to NYC. The xiao long bao are not xiao! They are quite big! Do not assume they are Ding Tai Feng sized dumplings! We had two orders of the pork soup dumplings and two orders of the pork and crab soup dumplings. I preferred the dumplings without the pork.

The green beans were also tasty.

We arrived about half an hour before opening and didn't line up until about 15 minutes before opening. We were able to grab a large table for 6. The staff are very efficient in seating you, taking your order, clearing the plates and grabbing your check and payment. Very lean operation.

If you are traveling as a small party be prepared to share a table.",1
"couldn't help but take my French friend to his first soup dumplings experience at none other than joe's shanghai! i remember when I first came here in 2016, this place blew me away (and dintaifung out of first place for soup dumplings for me).

- crab and pork soup dumplings ($10). these were the dumplings that stole my heart the first time i came!! the crab makes the filling just punch you in da face with flava... so bold, soooo crabby, and so soupy!! love love! 

- regular soup dumplings ($8). these were a lot less flavorful than the crab ones! if I didn't get these with the crab ones, they'd be decent, but in comparison, they were just ok! 

- boiled pork dumplings ($10). these dumplings thankfully came out before the soup dumplings ... i say that because they are pretty bland with a really soggy wrapper. they tasted ok by themselves, but once the soup dumplings came out, didn't really get any more attention from us... def just stick with the soul dumplings!!",1
"Go to the Chinatown location! (Or don't, so that I can get a table there quicker ;) ) seriously though the soup dumplings are to die for - if you eat here and don't get them I don't know what's wrong with you. They'll rock your world but be careful they're HOT!",1
"I love their beef tendon stew with tofu and Xiaolongbao very very very much. They are Super delish! Their noodles are good too.

Very crowded place though. After a long waiting and got seated, the seats were extremely close to the people beside us. We shared tables with the others all the time.

After all, come here for food. Nothing else.",1
"Great food and service from dumplings to entries. The only thing is braving the long lines, but worth it!",1
"Super yummy soup dumplings and cheap cold beer were enough to get me here, and are probably enough to get me to come back.",1
"Have been here multiple times and it doesn't change, it jsut remains great. Soup dumplings are the go-to and what their known for. Easily eat two baskets with a friend. All of the entree dishes like the spicy chicken dish with rice, etc are all great!",1
"the soup dumplings, period.  if you only want soup dumplings, then heres your place.  if you dont care about sitting next to strangers or getting mediocre service that push you out as fast as possible, then come here.  luckily, most people only care about that because its always crowded.  best soup dumplings around.  tried a few other places too, but nope not as good.  besides those, they have a really tasty pan fried noodle.  great taste.  so come for a quick great meal and maybe even meet a few strangers who have the same crave for a yummy soup dumpling.  a side note, the joes shanghai on fifth ave is terrible! way more expensive and food isnt as good.  only go to this location in chinatown.  cash only tho.",1
"The best Xiao Long Bao I've ever had. Visited NY two weeks ago, visited Joe's twice. The XLB was amazing! Big and juicy, very tasty. I'm a big XLB fan, after visiting Joe's Shanghai, Ding Tai Fung is no longer my favorite place to have XLB. Find no where to eat the best XLB at Los Angles. Definitely come back. Highly recommend!",1
"Yummy!!! LOVE soup dumplings and these were a good 8/10. I have had some really good xlb and I'd say these were pretty solid. The crispy noodles were also bussin and had a lot of beef and veggies! The beef wasn't cheap, asian fast food beef and there was a decent amount of it. 

We arrived around 6pm and didn't have to wait. There was a line by the time we left though! Prices aren't the lowest but the serving sizes are good. Servers are also always around to refill water which was nice.",1
"I've never tried soup dumplings in my life, and boy do I regret not trying them after my first visit to Joe's Shanghai. 
Their dumplings are juicy and tender, and dare I say the best dumplings I've ever tried in my life. 
Although I had to wait a while for a table, it was totally worth waiting out in a cold rain because those dumplings immediately warmed my body. 
I recommend trying them with fried rice and spinach. 
In fact, all dishes are delicious, so do yourself a favor and give them a try.",1
"the dumplings are cheap and delicious.  i went with my friend who is more familiar with the food than i am so i let her take the reins and she did an excellent job.  one good thing about communal sitting is that when you order too much (like we did), you can give it to your neighbors!  the scallion pancakes were so good.",1
"Newly renovated location = less claustrophobic, more luxe! (but we're talking about a high traffic Chinatown gem here, so folks, adjust your expectations accordingly).

Get pork soup dumplings during off-peak hours, like 3pm on a Tuesday.  Scallion pancakes don't disappoint either- they're crispy and crunchy (a rarity)!

Don't forget to bring cash!",1
"I was recommended this place due to its popularity & my love of soup dumplings.

Net, net: eh. Average rating is accurate at 4.3. Pork soup dumplings are good, but definitely have had better a few blocks away or for takeout in Brooklyn. I didn't strongly dislike it, but I also won't be seeking it out or marking it as a favorite.

Things I like:
- speedy: I arrived around 6:30 on a Monday in a hurry & got out by 7:05ish
- waiters are no fuss if that's you're style; however I did just realize I didn't see any waitresses 

Things I didn't like:
- personally, way too bright. I didn't get the Chinese cozy charm that I prefer
- 1 or 2 dumplings leaked in the container, so picking it up & placing on my spoon was unnecessarily messy
- I prefer spoons that are larger than the dumpling to feel secure in my bite & let the soup be runny for one big slurp
- broth was okay. ‍ I'm not sure how to describe it.. but it just didn't do it for me

It got packed around 7 with a wait out the door. So if you're still going to try it (because to each its own) & you don't want to wait - try before 6:30.

Also it's cash only. There's a sign when you walk in. Two ATMs. Two BOAs within a block in either direction. It's on alll of the reviews here & on Yelp. Please don't be that obnoxious tourist trying to negotiate using a CC. I'm embarrassed for you.",1
"We went there n Sat night and there were many people wait outside the door. OMG. So my friend and I waited about 30min and finally we had a seat in a big round table with seven other people. 

I must say the ""xiao long bao"" is sooooooooo delicious that I can't stop eating them!!! Highly recommand ""Crab Xiao Long"". It is so delicious and juicy. I think I ate 15 bao zi that night.

Also I like the red bean dim sum. It is puffy and sweet. Oh I can't help myself with one more!!!

Anyway, their space is too limited. People all sitting in a small place and talk to each other loudly.

In a word, I love it !",1
"Thank you fellow Yelper's!  I wanted to celebrate Chinese New Year's in Chinatown with some good soup dumplings, and I came to you for suggestions.  It was between Joe's and another place, but the other sounded like I wouldn't have room to sit.  

I was not disappointed- as soon as we receive menus, the efficient waiter asked how many soup dumpling orders we wanted.  They were working on those gorgeous babies while we browsed the menu for more good food.

I wasn't crazy about the boiled pork dumplings though- they were heavy and not appetizing enough to have more than one.  

We also ordered delicious sauteed water spinach and some baked turnip buns, and I obviously didn't eat fast enough, because my brother got most of the soup dumplings!  I will be back again.",1
"As a foodie and someone who loves Chinese food, I decided it was time to start exploring Chinatown. I've been to Joe's a few times now and I haven't been disappointed. They don't take reservations and it's always crazy so I try to go at off times and usually the wait is only a few minutes. The smaller your party, the better chance you have at sitting. I'd say if you go with more than three people your chances of sitting relatively quickly are slim.

I would give this place five stars but I usually always have some small issue with the service. I always have to ask at least two or three times before someone brings me water. From my encounters I've noticed the waiters aren't very good at catering to their specific tables so I try to grab whoever is closest to me but that doesn't always work.
As soon as you sit down they ask if you want soup dumplings because if you aren't get soup dumplings at Joe's, why did you even bother going? They're always on point and delicious.
I'd advise having some kind of idea what you want to eat before even sitting down so that as soon as the waiter comes over you can order your food and be done with it. Once they walk away, it's so difficult to get them back.",1
"Many good Chinese restaurants in NYC, by Joe's Shanghai never disappoints.  The soup dumplings are up to the hype and their braised noodle dishes are outstanding.  Worth every second I spent waiting to be seated (15 mins) and I recommend it highly.",1
"Excellent food, terrible service.  It says it is family friendly, but it really was not.",1
"Love love love the pork soup dumplings and the salt and pepper shrimp! I came here on a Monday around lunch time with some girlfriends and luckily we beat the lunch crowd that were waiting in line for a good minute. I heard it gets really crowded and is usually a long wait on most days so I'm really glad we lucked out and were seated right away.The service was very efficient and the food was delicious, I will definitely be back!",1
"Excellent Soup Dumplings.  There is usually a line, but it moves fast.  Be prepared to sit with strangers.  The place is crowded and loud.

Soup Dumplings are what makes this place famous, and you shouldn't miss them, but the rest of the menu is very good.

The staff is fast and abrupt.  It's tough to get clear answers to any questions you might ask.

I've been twice and would eat here again.",1
"Best Chinese food in the country. Located in the heart of Chinatown.

No reservations so be early and expect a wait, worth it...

Last visit, Tuesday afternoon, I went around 11:45 sat down right away, it was packed with a waiting list when we left. Incredible in Chinatown where there are literally hundreds of choices.  Most other diners were native Chinese, I was one of the few ""white"" guys there.  My dining companion is Phillipino so they let it go... just kidding.

My must have foods start with the crab soup dumplings. I could finish there but the young chow fried rice is the BEST ever!  The braised port shoulder is a delicacy.  Don't forget to get a scallion pancake, goes perfectly with the the rice or on its own.

You will not be dissatisfied even if you have to wait....  a nice tea compliments the lunch well.",1
Love the dumplings here! Crab and pork are my fav. My friends and I will do food tours around NYC (we come from all over the states) and we always make sure to come here and get a FEW orders of the dumplings! Haven't had another place like this one!,1
You have to come here to try the Crab dumpling. They are know for this.  It is soo good. At first I order one order of the Crab dumpling and didn't realize how good it was.  After I midway finish the 1st order I had to order another because it was that good. I also order a few other dishes here but it was ok. The food tends to be a little greasy but that's your typical chinese food. The restaurant is small and a little dirty but they are very busy. If you don't have a large party be prepare to share a table if your seated in one of the bigger tables. It's how' your typical asian restaurants are run if you came from Hong Kong. They have a lot of servers here so the service is quick. No matter what time you come here there is always a lot of people.,1
"I always see these soup dumplings on the travel channel and I always wanted to try it.  I'm so glad my first time is at an authentic Chinese restaurant.  The dumpling comes out piping hot so be careful with your first bite.  It comes in a pork or crab meat variety, I like the pork more.   We also ordered Salt and Pepper Pork Chops and Beef Lo Mein.  The pork chops was really good, the lo mein I can do with out though.  It was really pack so you may have to share table more smaller groups.",1
"if i'm in new york for 3 days (and i will be next week) i'll go here twice and get the xiao long bao. i like to think san francisco has a pretty broad spectrum of food but nowhere in the bay area have i gotten xlb anywhere as good as at joe's shanghai in new york. i know someone else basically said the same thing but it's worth stating again. for a while i was on a mission to find it in san francisco, on the peninsula, basically anywhere i could get to in a car. alas i have given up and settled for joe's shanghai",1
"When you arrive at the restaurant you're probably going to have to wait to be seated, but trust me it is worth it. When you finally make it inside you will notice one thing: soup dumplings on every table. These are some of the best soup dumplings in the city and must be ordered if you decide to dine at Joe's Shanghai. The broth within the soup is so perfectly flavorful and the perfect amount of creamy. The pork is well seasoned and the chives bring it all together. Nothing is better the eating soup dumplings on a cold New York day. Please visit!",1
"Great tastes! Soup dumplings were fantastic! Portions are very large we couldn't finish everything but it was enough to bring home for a lunch next day. Long waiting line, however we came for a late lunch around 3-4pm and only had to wait 15min.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is a solid soup dumpling spot that I frequent when I am visiting NYC! My sister lives in NYC and I am from out of town so whenever I go visit she always brings me here for a meal. They have good soup dumplings, not the best I have ever had but definitely good and the portion size to price is pretty good as well. They have a good amount of soup inside of them and the meat filling to soup/wrapper ratio is good as well. We also ordered the sweet and sour soup and the beef low mein which were solid choices as well. This is a new location they opened up which is more spacious and updated than their previous locations. Overall I definitely enjoyed this place and would recommend.",1
Xiao long bao lives up to the billing.  I ordered the pork shoulder and must admit it was super tender and incredibly tender.  the portion size could have easily could have served 2-3 guests.  the wait may be 20-40 minutes but that is the norm and the staff does a great job of moving things along without really rushing the customers.  Highly recommended.,1
"Excellent option for this cuisine! A star cleanliness rating. Best scallion pancakes I've ever had. The pork soup dumplings were fantastic too. On top of it all, friendly service.",1
"Dumpling breakfast happiness. Fast easy tasty, my love for dumplings  thank you. Go eat and be merry",1
My husband and I had to try Joe's Shanghai when visiting NYC for the holidays. We were pleasantly surprised surprised that there was no line it was definitely busy though. We shared a table with another couple which I thought would be weird since the tables are so small but it wasn't. Every table had 1+ orders of the soup dumplings. We tried them and they were good. They're definitely worth giving a try. We also had the fried dumplings and pork fried rice which were ok.,1
"It was definitely a positive experience. Being able to sit with others and see what they ordered, as well as enjoy our food at a low price, it was the highlight of our day. Scallion pancakes, both kinds of soup dumplings, and shredded pork soup were amazing!",1
"Walked in here at 2 ish on a Sunday, scared that the wait would be monstrous. Luckily got seated right away. Just had to share a table with 6 others, nbd as long as we got our dumpling fix. $14 for an order of dumplings, beef soup noodles, and scallion pancake? Not bad at all. 

Be careful about the temperature of the dumplings!! I really like their hot sauce and mixing it with some of the vinegar for a kick, but really the dumplings are perfect on their own, without sauce. 

My goal in the future is to have a dry plate. Aka, no soup spillage. It always breaks my heart when the soup oozes out. Not only is it ugly, but it's such a waste of the hearty, delicious xlb broth.

Oh yea their tea was particularly nasty :( dunno why it tasted like a mixture of a million different types of tea leaves. It's such a simple thing but it really disturbed me.",1
My go to place for Shanghainese in NYC. Always packed but worth the wait.,1
"I've heard such good things about this place that I was really excited to go. There were a bunch of people outside waiting to be seated but my boyfriend and I only needed to wait around 10 minutes for the two of us. They do an interesting thing where if you have a small enough party, they do community tables and you share a table with another small party. I was pretty hungry so I didn't mind sharing a table.

We ordered two orders of xiao long baos (xlb) and one order of potstickers for 6.25 each and 8 pieces which is pretty cheap! When we got the orders they were super hot and fresh! The potstickers were flavorful and luckily it didn't taste too oily like some places make it. The xlb were huge and very flavorful! Probably the best soup dumplings I've ever had!",1
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE shanghai dumplings! I haven't had good shanghai dumplings since my go-to shanghai restaurant shut down a few years ago back in the bay area. I was so excited to try their dumplings after reading the yelp reviews. We ordered the shanghai dumplings, fried bean curd, vegetarian duck & shanghai noodle soup. This place is sooo cheap! The meal was about $23 for all we ordered! Everything was good!!",1
"What can I say about Joe's that hasn't already been said? Yes, you're probably going to have to wait. Yes, it's cash only. Yes, you're going to have to share a table with strangers.

Honestly, all of this is manageable if you come prepared. Put in your name and go walk around, grab some dollar dumplings down the street, etc. Get cash from any of the major banks in Chinatown. Sharing the table is no big deal. I've been here countless times and sometimes you sit with chatty people, sometimes everyone sticks to themselves and their group. 

Now, onto the food. The soup dumplings are very, very good, but I have had better in Flushing. The rest of the menu is good too, but obviously the soup dumplings are the main attraction. The service is fine. You definitely do have to flag wait staff down for water, extra napkins, etc. but I'm not expecting silver service here. 

I come here a few times a year and it's always worth it.",1
Hole in the wall with the most delicious soup dumplings. Every time I'm in the city I frequent this place! Meaning I come here 2-3 times even if I'm only in town for the weekend. The other food options are alright but I definitely recommend their specialty dumplings. Lunchtime during the week is always hectic but I do not care. I will wait around for a table for those dumplings. The ambiance is a little chaotic... expect to share your table with strangers! Don't bring friends that are picky eaters or don't like pork. This is not for them.,1
Best soup dumplings in Chinatown. Chose the pork meat dumplings as those were recommended.  Went here for lunch on a Sunday. Be prepared to wait but they have a ticket number system that moves fast. They also have a lot of tables and turn them over quickly. Everything was very fresh and clean and they had tons of staff who helped us order quick and get on with our day walking around Chinatown and Little Italy.,1
Dumplings here are the best I've ever had. We ordered them fried. I also liked the soup dumplings but be warned that they are messy. We were able to sit after about a 30 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon. The sesame chicken I could have done without. Definitely will be back.,1
"Stopped at Joe's for dinner while visiting NY and was impressed! I highly suggest the pork dumplings - they are excellent and great for sharing! The helpings are pretty big so we split out entree as well. Something to be aware of prior to going is that it's a little noisy, you may be seated at a table with other people - there were 3 of us and we sat at a table with another group of 5 - and it's CASH ONLY!",1
"Wow -- the passions invoked by Xiaolongbao...  :)  I'm going to write a different sort of review, particularly since most of the reviews have discussed many points to death, ie: quality of service, decor (lack thereof), alternative foods to the house specialty -- I agree with the concensus statements.

However, the XLB must be respected.  There's a comparison in an earlier review between Joe's and Ding Tai Fong of Taiwanese fame.  The mother ship restaurant in TPE is solid -- I can definitely say it's worth eating -- but other franchises (say, in LA?) aren't as good as the mothership.  Haven't been to the one in Japan yet...  Furthermore, true dumpling fever really doesn't hit you until you try the best in SH.  Though I've had some pretty amazing dumplings in Toronto and HKG.

But wherever you go, Xiaolongbao definitely serve as a display for one's dumpling proficiency.  Why?  Because the XLB requires quite a few components.  (Though, I like Shengjianbao -- and to me it can  display even more aspects of dumpling mastery)

What is it?  Simply put, you can call it a soup dumpling.  Traditionally served in round, wooden containers, the dumplings are cooked over a stream of steam, that can heat a whole stack of round containers, which are porous on the bottom.   The first place to screw up is what you cook it on.  Tradition puts it on a leaf -- which soaks up oil, but more importantly, prevents sticking to the container.   Sticking to the container loses dumpling points -- which can cause tears in the skin leading to tears in the eye of the dumpling lover as the ""soup"" pours out and away.  Personally, I like to transfer the dumpling into a chinese soup spoon first, where you can inspect it and ""enhance it"" with sauce.

The sauce is traditionally a soy based sauce with strips of garlic.  It's probably a bit uncouth to dip your food in the sauce, so one might consider pouring some atop the soup dumpling.  I've seen some people open the dumpling on top, (carefully! lest the soup spill!) and pour some of the sauce into the dumpling.  A good sauce for XLB should provide contrast to the flavour -- and no more.  The richness of the XLB soup and the texture and flavour of the meat should be the centerpiece.

Let's move further inside.   The skin shows off another dumpling skill.  Bad skin falls apart, tears easily, is uneven...  Bad skin folding results in uncomely dumplings.  Some houses make their skin thick and spongey, others thin and more elastic.  DTF goes for option 2, Joe's type 1.

Inside -- the ""soup"" and the meat.  I'm not going to go into too much detail here... but the ""soup"" obviously is not recommended for a ""heart-healthy diet"".  It's largely adipose... but is included as an additional component -- it's not ""just"" the natural juices of the meatball inside -- be they crab based or pork based.  

So: score card:
Skills for the container
Skin 
Skin folding
Sauce
Soup
Stuffing (meatball)

Don't worry, I'm not actually going to rate Joe's this way.  :)  I like their XLB -- but I don't love them.   I give them a 4 for taste and accessibility.  You don't need to get on a plane to get them, and its in a reasonably accessible place in NYC.  I'm not a big fan of their skin style -- and sometimes the crab consistency is a bit powdery for my tastes.  On the other hand, I stop by Joe's every other trip to NYC... so that should tell you something?",1
"Don't be a tourist. Follow these simple rules:

1. Take the train to Canal street (parking is a toss-up)
2. Only order the soup dumplings (get one order per person, e.g. one pork, one crab, if you're with two)
3. Get Chinese beer with it
4. Bring cash (they only take cash)
5. Don't whine about waiting for a precious seat  (you're in NYC, no one's special)
6. Don't show up with half your party (if you want to eat within a reasonable amount of time, limit its size)
7. Do get a bubble tea from next door while waiting in order to curb your hunger
8. Don't be afraid to eat the cabbage
9. You can use the sauce if you like, but it isn't necessary.

I was born and raised in NYC, yet haven't lived there in over a decade. I still come back just for the dumplings. Yes, they are that good.

*** BONUS: A common game played is to take bets on who spills the least soup. The person with the dirtiest plate at the end of the meal pays.",1
"Amazing soup dumplings! My husband and I have been on the search for good soup dumplings, and this hit the spot. Will be coming back to New York for more.",1
"The soup dumplings are good, and you have to share the table. But Like I said the soup dumplings are sooooooo good. The wait is a mutha too, but it is worth it. Did I say the soup dumplings are good.",1
"Love this place! One of my must go to places in NY for their stream soupy dumplings.  This place always have a long line, but they work fast and it's cheap!  Can't beat it!  If you're new to NY, I would highly recommend this place...it's so popular...it comes up on google maps when u're looking at the area.",1
Went there for lunch. There's no line and it's cash only but there's an ATM nearby. The interior decorations are nice. We ordered the crab and pork soup dumpling and the Shanghai egg noodles with chicken. The soup dumplings  are amazing and flavorful. This is a must. We didn't like the noodles for it's price its not worth it.,1
"The first time I came to Joe's Shanghai, I was still a kid visiting NY for the first time with my parents and their friends.  I remembered the busy atmosphere, the fish tank at the door, and the set up of the tables.  Most of all, I remember how happy I was eating the endless number of yummy dumplings.  The only thing I didn't remember was the name of the restaurant.  Years later, I came here again because of a friend's recommendation, and the second I set foot in the restaurant, I knew I was in the same restaurant I visited as a kid.  It was a very special moment....

So back to the review:
The soup dumplings seriously make me weep with joy...I love those little things!  You can't come here and not order these!  After ordering these, just pick whatever else you want off the menu...I haven't had a bad dish here yet.  The dumplings are the most memorable thing about the restaurant though.   

The service is kind of rushed because the place is always packed during mealtimes, and they like to group different parties at one large table to seat everyone more efficiently.  I don't really mind because the food comes out at lightning speed.  

I took off one star because the wait for seating can be torture. I remember waiting for an hour just to get in once.  Watching everyone else enjoying their awesome dumplings makes me really grumpy.  But when you finally sit down and have that first soup dumpling, you realize that it was all worth it!  

I make trips to NYC a lot (mostly for the food), and I never leave without at least getting some dumplings from Joe's.  I am so thankful to have found this restaurant again!",1
"Pork xiao long bao on a rainy December day = perfection. Got here close to opening time on a Thursday so no wait. There's definitely an art in eatu g these without breaking them and wasting all the yummy soup! 

I came with my mom, and she agrees four stars is appropriate. She was a little peeved that they didn't accept cards, as its more of a restaurant than a small eats shop.",1
"The soup dumplings, scallion pancake, general Taos chicken are delicious and a MUST when you visit this restaurant. You may have to wait to be seated, but it is well worth the wait!!",1
"The soup dumplings were amazing!!! We waited 45 min to get seated and we sat at a big table next to two other couples. First time dining at a place where we had to sit with random people. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was. We also ordered noodles and Kung pao chicken. It was good, but wouldn't go back for that but would go back just for the soup dumplings!!! Advice: order 2-3 orders of soup dumplings and nothing else. The sauce, the texture, meat all together was ridiculously good. The more soup dumplings you eat, the more you want to keep eating them!!!",1
"Despite having been to nyc quite a few times I had never gotten around to going to this iconic NYC institution.

My moms side is from the Shanghai region and so I grew up eating Shanghainese food. What's interesting about this restaurant is that they seem to cater to people seeking authentic Shanghainese food as well as people who are here just for the soup dumplings who order things like general tsos chicken and beef and broccoli.

Egg rolls, $3.50 EACH is a bit much. There is a particular variety of egg roll unique to Shanghai. This is not it.
Soup dumplings, these are legit. Great pork and crab flavor. Good amount of soup. Very satisfying. Skin is on the thicker side but didn't bother me. No complaints here.
Yang chow fried rice, had all the correct components including chicken and ham. would have been good, but they forgot the salt.
Shanghai fried noodles, thick noodles stir fried w pork and spinach. Good wok hai, good flavor.
Lions head meatballs, super soft, fatty and luscious. Very tasty.

Overall I generally find these places to be overhyped, but this place met expectations for the most part aside from a few missteps.",1
"Chinese food is never on my craving radar (cravedar?) when I charged with choosing (essentially never).  Therefore, I (1) don't know anything about the great Chinese restaurants in NYC and (2) would never willingly try one on my own.

Needless to say I found myself at Joe's Shanghai for a good friend's birthday party and the food was seriously stellar.  We ordered around a dozen dishes to share and everything was communally placed on the glass inner circle, which could be rotated by anyone for the greatest instant gratification dining experience you can imagine.  

Even if - like me - you would be fine never eating Chinese food again - you must check this place out...good as it gets.",1
"Dumprings! I love me some dumprings! 

After a 20min wait, we sat down and ordered the pork dumplings, green onion pancake, green beans, and drunken chicken. These XLB's are some of the juiciest I've ever had, but the skin could've been thinner. They tasted so meaty, I almost thought they were beef for a minute. 

8 large dumprings for $4.95 vs. 10 small dumprings for $10.95 at Din Tai Fung. Just a completely different dining experience. Joe's is grungy, bustling, and they churn out some delightful soupy morsels.",1
"came several minutes before it open to avoid the crowds.  Let me tell you, the crab soup dumplings were awesome.  Pours some vinegar and hot sauce and you are all set.  This is by far the best thing i ever ate in my new york city trip!",1
"Serve super fantastic xiaolongbao (dumpling). The place isn't that big so if your party is 1-3, you might share the table with others",1
"Stopped in one day for lunch... ok, just a TON of dumplings... and man were we stuffed!

Decor: While unassuming from the outside it is semi-cramped inside (expect to share a table with one, or two, groups). The actual decor is about what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. The tables vary in size but the smaller the group the better... - be warned that it does get BUSY during lunch.
Bathroom: I didn't use it while there.

Staff: Our waiter was very attentive and very quick with taking our orders. He was speedy bringing out our multiple orders of Soup Dumplings and everything arrived at once.

Food: We started with the Pork Soup Dumplings (x3) and that is all we had haha. Wow, the Soup Dumplings are OUT OF THIS WORLD FANTASTIC! We knew what we were there for (as I've been to Joe's in mid-town previously) and we enjoyed every bite. I would, however, recommend that if you are ordering multiple orders of dumplings you should do them (at most) two at a time - any more than that and they can cool off by the time you get to them. Oh, and hot tea is complimentary but we had tap water (you have to ask for it) and two Cokes.

Value: The prices are not bad and the food is delicious, so you get great value for your money here! P.S. - Cash only!

This place is a great spot and the dumplings are worth it alone. I already can't wait to tell others about this place and am already dying to go back!",1
"Soup dumplings! Oh, my lovely soup dumplings! Yes, this place is touristy. Yes, there is always a wait. Yes, they sometimes rush you out. But if you are prepared for these things, and just keep thinking that the food will be worth it, then you are in for a treat. Everything I have ever had is yummy. Crispy prawns, shredded beef, noodles, fried rice, General Tsao's, and their shrimp wonton soup. It's all yum. This is a cash only establishment, and even though tip is included, they will sometimes not return with your change, thinking it's a tip. Make sure you tell them that you expect change. You can, of course, then tip them over the 15%. Can't wait to go back!",1
"Being from LA, the closest we have to this is a Din Tai Fung. But honestly it's not even good to me! So I was kinda iffy trying this place out. I had to give it a try because my friends were raving about this place. It is kinda of awkward having to share table with strangers like now I really have to eat properly. Everything we got was so good. Service was okay!",1
Great soup dumplings!!  i like that the chicken is not in pork broth.,1
"I came here with a friend and thanks to Yelp I came prepared knowing that the first thing that would be asked by the waiter as we get seated is whether we want the dumplings for they take a bit to come out. I told him we wanted both the pork and crab one. We also ordered the shredded beef with peppers and another beef and chicken dish. Starting off with the dumplings, I really recommend the pork ones, they have a really good taste. The shell is the right consistency and the meat inside was really good. The crab ones (seafood dumpling or whatever it actually was ) we did not really like. The taste and smell of it just wasn't appetizing to either of us. We left three or so on the bamboo dish. Its true what they say that you will be sharing your table with other people but it makes it interesting because our table at least was open to conversation. The walls are covered with photos of famous people that have visited we were stoked when we saw the character that plays Daryl on the walking dead had visited. As we were leaving in front of us came in Justin Brescia. I didn't know who he was but my friend got super excited and took her word of his importance. She didn't ask for his photo because she didn't want to intrude on his date. But anyways this place is a must for soupy dumplings, pork are a must, crab = try at your own risk.",1
"Dear reviewers,
Please stop posting pictures of the soup dumplings.
After 1000 of the same pictures, I believe users will get an idea of what they look like.

Anyway, you can tell by the 2000+ reviews and the line that's out the door on a cold winter night that this place is simply awesome.  Like Barney Stinson awesome.
AWESOME!",1
"We were a little caught off guard when our party of two was taken to a large table to share with two other parties, but it's only a hassle for the party on the side of the wall, since it's hard for them to get out after finishing their meal.

We ordered the Shanghai fried noodles and the soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were amazing, and it was funny how they gave us a pair of tongs to pick up each dumpling. The soup dumplings were amazing, though - would absolutely come here again just for that. The Shanghai fried noodles were also very good - we ordered it because it's such a classic dish for us to get whenever we go to Shanghainese places - it was good but didn't necessarily stand out to us.",1
Always a solid experience.  Great menu and of course the soup dumplings are among the best in NYC.,1
"This place was PACKED on a Saturday lunchtime. I was told the wait time for party of 2 was 15 min but waited about 20 min. 

We ordered the pork soup dumplings which was amazing it's definitely a MUST TRY and the serving portions was huge. It arrived first and didn't get the noodles until much later, I had to follow up twice to get it. 

When the Shanghai sautéed udon noodles arrived it was pretty good but honestly not worth the wait. I'm docking a star for the lack of ambiance, it was too crowded and no music which I consider an important part of the experience. I would come here again on a weekday and order the pork dumplings again. 

Value - 5/5
Ambiance - 3/5 
Food - 4/5",1
"Bustling restaurant with decent ambiance. Ordered the Soup dumplings & crispy shredded beef, delicious! Cash only so come prepared. Only complaint, the tea was pretty bad but overall worth trying!",1
"Best soup dumplings in the city.  Touristy but worth it.  (Crab dumplings so-so, pork dumplings are amazing).",1
"***NOT A DIMSUM PLACE***

We came from DC metro area and was looking for a good dim sum place. I loved how the Shanghai food here was not greasy at all! The food overall was very good and the condiments were a nice addition. Although I was originally disappointed since it did not have dimsum, but it worked out for the best since everything we got was so delicious.",1
"Lets do some simple math here:

+5 Stars for the Soup Dumplings
- 3 Stars for the confusing service (I believe that we somehow ordered without looking at the menu, and within, oh, 4 seconds of being seated)
- 1 Star for our spring rolls never arising
+1 Star for being an anchor destination to get me out to explore Flushing
+ 2 Stars for the price - 15% gratuity included, in and out with a a slaked party of 3 for under $20.

That's it. Go for the soup dumplings, leave a happy, albeit somewhat confused camper.",1
"Came here on one of our last days in NYC, a rainy day infact. That didn't seem to dampen the mood once the we poured some hot tea. 

The shanghai dumpling or siu long bao was pretty good. I've had better, but it was reasonably priced and still very good. Had noodles, can't recall which kind, but that I did enjoy them. 

Would come back if I was in the area ever again .

As far as service decor and what not, don't expect anything more than a typical chinese eatery.",1
The soup dumplings are fantastic.  The dough is great.  Not too doughy and not too thin.  And the flavor of the broth is phenomenal.  The staff is nice but just a heads up that you may feel a bit rushed.  If you are lucky enough to snag a table just know that there is a long line of people waiting behind you and you will feel the eyes of the staff waiting for you to finish your food.  You will get used to it though so no hard feelings!,1
"This is a great place for America shanghainese cuisine. However, it may not be the perfect place for Shanghainese, it's not a native shanghainese flavor. If you don't like flighting all the way to China, this will be one of few good choices to settle with.  

All the food here is good enough for everyday consumption, but sometimes the freshness of the ingredients need an upgrade. (E.g. Steamed soup buns). If your soup buns have massive vinegar in them, you should start questioning the freshness of the meat. It happens from time to time.

Anyway, Joe's Shanghai is standing out with above average food and quality service in Chinese community. It's a good choice for family lunch or dinner.",1
"BEST SOUP DUMPLINGS EVER!!! We got there just before it open at 10:50 am. Good thing too because after like 5 mins later there was a line already 2 store front down. 

The place seem like the other Joes shanghai i tried a couple years back when I came. Not much that huge can fit a decent amount of people. 

The shine come from the resturant namely there soup dumplings. The best I ever had. Mainly came just to eat it again. Mouth watering..",1
"I sound like a schlocky country bumpkin tourist but the General Tso chicken was the best thing we had. It was perfect. The meat in the soup dumplings was meh but otherwise they were great. I liked the family style seating and the wait went quick (15 minutes). Service was predictably terrible but as Jack said, it's Chinatown.",1
"What does one do when he has jury duty downtown for lunch?  Well, you can go to your favorite Chinese spot, or you can really take advantage and go somewhere that usually has a ridiculous wait at night or on weekends.  Joe's Shanghai definitely fulfills the latter so off I went.  

No wait for a table of one, sweet.  I went with the standard order of soup dumplings and scallion pancakes, figured I'd keep it simple.  Five minutes later the food finally appears...making this a good spot if they cut your lunch break at jury duty, though does that ever happen?

Anyway, soup dumplings were pretty standard, nothing that stood out among other places in Chinatown.  The scallion pancakes though?  They were top notch, can't think of a better spot in Chinatown off of the top of my head, they felt like they were double fried for double the yumminess (and probably double the fat).",1
"Visited Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown for dinner based on a recommendation. The 25-minute wait for seating was tolerable given the restaurant's size and comfort. The servers were sweet, but unfortunately, the food lacked flavor and felt overpriced. Beware, it's cash-only, and there's an automatic 18% gratuity. Overall, a mediocre experience with nothing noteworthy to rave about.",1
"Went to Joe's on our first night in NYC. Had this recommended by many and bookmarked when we decided to come to NY. Let start off by saying that we are lovers of XLbao and come from the west coast of din tai fung. We came with an open mind and was absolutely BLOWN away. 

I think we got lucky b/c we had NO wait. Walked in and sat right now. 

Ambiance: Small chinese establishment in chinatown. Loud. You may be put in a community table as small parties is hard to accomodate since they have quite a few large tables. For us it was no problem b/c we've been to many asian establishments that do this. I can tell other groups of travelers were not as comfortable but hey this is a learning experience right! Overall ambiance is pretty typical of a fast pace chinese restaurant. Has a family feel to it as well. You can see pictures of the numerous celebrities on the wall that have tried their food which is always kind of cool too. 

Service: Fast and easy. We had NO problem with the waiting staff and they were very quick to all of our request. Food came out hot and we didn't' have to wait long for our food to come. 

Food: OMG. That's all I can say. It was SOOOO good.. thats all we were craving for the next few days in NYC. Unfortunately, we did not go back but we still crave the nomz till this day in LA. The XL bao was to DIE for. IT was sooooo juicy. It had a good balance of sweet and salt. Can we talk about the size though? We ordered the crab and the regular pork one and devoured them as if we never ate in our life. I think for us one of the main differences that DTF has with this place is that their soup is a little more oily compared to the clean taste DTF has. But hey.. a little more OIL and fattiness doesn't hurt right? The green onion pancake.. you know how when you take a bite of something and you smile bc it was bomb? well my boyfriend's face and EYES smiled to a point i'm like.. uhh are you okay? He said it was one of the best he's had. We always order it everywhere we go and he said it was the best. The noodles were a tad salty but it was still VERY VERY good! overall 5/5 highly recommend and if they were to EVERY open on in LA...omg. everyday man. 

I think some reviews were upset about the wait. I understand.. considering how small of a place it is. I still think overall we had a 5/5 experience and the food speaks for itself. HIGHLY recommend if you love soup dumplings!",1
"[02/11/2010, 9:00pm]

My then boyfriend took my best friend (who was visiting from Bolivia) and I here while we were on vacation in NYC...and now we're married. For those who argue that correlation doe not imply causation, I beg to differ, at least for the case of Joe's Shanghai.

What we ordered:
Shanghai Cabbage w/Meat Wonton in Broth 
Shanghai Chives & Shrimp w/Meat Wonton in Broth
Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (with Pork)
Beef with String Beans

Best soup dumplings ever. EVER. Oh, and the eggplant pork is delicious and the green beans so crispy and flavorful. Mmmmm. LOVE.",1
I could eat these soup dumplings every day for the rest of my life and never tire of them. That's all you need to know. Even in a takeout container they're *chefs kiss*,1
"Sorry din tai fung, I've replaced you with Joe's Shanghai. I fell in love with the pork soup dumplings (XLB) here. You get 8 big and juicy dumplings for $6 which is a price that you can't get elsewhere. My boyfriend and I shared 3 orders and finished it feeling satisfied. Tons of flavor with authenticity.  

Be advised that you may share a table with a different party if you have space available.",1
Always packed but worth the wait. Mouth watering soup dumplings are too delicious for words. The combo crab and pork is my ultimate favorite. I have tried other dishes as well and they are also tasty!,1
"Are you kidding me NYC? BEST SOUP DUMPLINGS IVE EVER HAD. 

Soup Dumplings (5 stars) - comes with 8 HUGE dumplings and the best soup ive ever tasted

Crispy beef (5 stars) - so flavorful and cooked perfectly!

Shanghai noodles (5 stars) - oh gawd....

Chicken fried rice (3 1/2 stars) - it was good. Not the best ive had

CASH ONLY!!!",1
Absolutely loved this place! We were in town as tourists and our friend who lived in the city told me of this place. Most amazing food and great dumplings!! The wait is worth it!,1
"Came here this past Sunday with a group of 10 people, around 1pm.  Around the corner, another dim sum place had over an hour wait.  Here, we waited about 20 minutes, which for a large group in the middle of the weekend, is a dream.

Great food, quick, FRIENDLY service, and SO VERY AFFORDABLE!  We got TONS of food and only paid about $20 bucks each.  There are also tons of vegetarian options so fellow vegs need not worry.",1
The soup dumplings are simply the BEST. Nowhere else compares.,1
"Wow...wow.

(did you notice the double-wow?)  I was really blown away by the xiao long bao at this place - they're definitely the juiciest that I remember. The price at under $5 for a basket of 8 really earned it the 5th star in my book.

People mention that the it's not all that - and it gets boring after a while.  Well most things you eat for a prolonged period of time have the same effect.  But if you REALLY like soup dumplings and they're one of your favorite foods, then you'll have no problem finishing a basket here.

The one downside was that I didn't find anything else on their menu that was great.  Part of the reason is that I frankly don't know how to order here.  If you're reading these reviews I suggest finding OTHER dishes to get.  You're obviously going to try the xiao long bao...so focus your efforts elsewhere.  I had:

-Hot and Sour Soup - gooood taste but not hot (temperature) enough.  It was warm/hot.
-Shanghainese Noodles - not bad as a side dish or in place of fried rice/rice
-Beef Noodle Soup - really bad. haha.  I was envisioning Din Tai Fung where the xiao long bao and beef noodle soup were BOTH amazing.

I didn't have these but they looked pretty awesome:
-Eggplant
-Fried Tofu
-Scallion Pancakes

And a note about the service/rudeness.  I didn't notice anything wrong with their service.  I felt a bit rushed at some points (primarily to order) which I'm guessing is what others refer to as being ""rude.""  A lot of others complain about long waits.  Sorry yelpers, but this isn't a perfect world.  You're going to be rushed to order in order for people NOT to wait.  If you're going to complain about one, don't complain about the other! lol.  I also felt like it's the good old-fashioned chinese style...they want things to be quick and efficient.  However, even though I was able to order quickly in cantonese, I never saw them get mad at anyone else that was slow to order...so just go and enjoy it already if you're in NY! :)",1
"Stopped in for soup, dumplings, and soup dumplings. Everything was great. Love the feel of Chinatown and the vibe of the restaurant.",1
Good soup dumplings. Good shanghai fried noodles. Place is located on an unassuming side street in chinatown. But this place is legit. One of my favorite chinese meals in new york.,1
"Okay so it's true, the pork dumplings are amazing here. I like how they do their green beans, too. But this brief review is dedicated to that seasonal delicacy, the soft shell crab. 

I never used to go to Joe's because I really hate the whole waiting an hour for my dinner scene, but when softies are in season, I will put up with it, thanks to a friend of a friend who turned me on to the magical time known as soft shell crab season at Joe's Shanghai. It's like he gave me my first hit of crack: now I stand outside with the huddled masses, awaiting the moment my number is called, so that I may eat crunchy sea bugs and soupy balls filled with seasoned ground pork. Yes.",1
"Long wait outside (40+ mins in a Friday evening). Lovely dumplings (pork were best). Colorful service (brusque but comical). Great price. Green beans were tasty, fried chicken was okay.",1
The soup dumplings were amazing! The pork and crab were absoltely delicious. Would have given five stars but it is always so crowded. I was lucky enough to get my own table.,1
Ugh so good. Give me all the dumplings. *Tip: when  eating dumplings use the spoon to catch all the juice. 1. It's delicious 2. It will get all over you if you don't. Authentic Chinese- simply delicious. Yeah you'll wait 30-40 minutes but it's worth the wait! OH! Big thing to note: they only accept cash which is odd BUT they have a ATM right by the door.,1
"The last time I had Joe's Shanghai, I was a wee (actually, not so wee, the Senior 15 is a very real phenomenon) college student, intimidated by large Chinatown crowds and by Chinatown waiters who slap utensils down on the table, but lured by this thing called soup dumplings. It's been a long time since I inhaled that first burning gulp of crab-infused pork broth, mixed with the a few drops of soy sauce and ginger. 

My first piece of advice is to get here before the obvious meal times - if you're going on a weekend, the best bet is 2:00-5:00. 

My second piece of advice is to tell the waiter right off the bat that you're ordering soup dumplings, so that, if you time it just right, the first batch comes to your table only a few minutes after you place your order for other dishes. 

Everything other than the soup dumplings was a little less dazzling. I loved how sugary and crunchy the crispy sliced beef was, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea.  The crispy pepper skin duck and baby bok choy were standard Chinatown fare. 

If you're less than 5 people, get ready to share a table with other happy strangers slurping down soup dumplings. 

NEXT TIME: more of the crab-pork, though if I end up in Chinatown during a peak hour, I'm sure there's another restaurant a stone's throw away that also serves soup dumplings.",1
"I'm laughing reading the reviews for this place. People are giving them less stars because they're crowded (because the food is great and not their fault), because they do communal seating (this allows more people to be seated), automatically charge gratuity (a ton of their customers are tourists who wouldn't tip otherwise and being a waiter here must be one of the most stressful experiences of all time), and are cash only (this is completely reasonable and they have an atm at the front for your convenience.) 

Soup dumplings are incredible, scallion pancakes and crispy and perfect, Lo mein is smoky and wonderful, prices are beyond reasonable for a place this hyped and the portions are massive. My coworkers and I routinely go after work and are more than happy to wait because it's always worth it!",1
"Great dumplings for a great price!!! Yes, you are seated at the table with strangers if you have a smaller party. Most importantly - it's a CASH only establishment [at least for when I was there, they only wanted cash.. so he told me to go to the pharmacy across the street. For this reason, I give them 4 stars, because there should be more signs posted if this is the case or they should inform parties before they are seated]",1
I LOVE SOUP DUMPRINGS. Nom nom nom. I love when they give me third degree burns in my mouth~ HASHASHASHA!,1
good simple food.  dumplings were solid.  beef noodle soup was just what i was craving for.  would like to explore their menu further the next time im in town.,1
"Joe's Shanghai! Really delicious soup dumplings that come out piping hot. I was very impressed that the waiter immediately asked us what kind we wanted right as were getting seated. ""Pork,"" my friend declared. We also ordered the Shrimp and Chicken in Plum Sauce based on recommendations. It was tasty. I couldn't quite figure out what the crispy vegetable in it was... wintermelon? Anyway, overall experience was good. 

Zero wait time, fast service, and filling food.",1
Great soup dumplings and sesame chicken was sweet with Smokey flavor from the wok. Went on a Friday night and it was packed. Only had to wait less than 30 min. Practiced great Covid safety measures.,1
"Great food, great mini bum, avoid the rush hours if you can not wait that long
Excellent service as well.",1
"EPIC get the soup dumplings and the meatballs!!!!! The wait can be long and the service is rushed but that's part of the experience. The food, all of it, is succulent like MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.",1
"Every time I am in New York, I visit Joe's.  This place is amazing.  This is where I fell in love with Soup Dumplings and will always be my favorite.   A few weeks ago, I was able to bring my two children (9 and 11) to try soup dumplings at Joes and they fell in love immediately.  Love, love, love this place.  Thanks.",1
"The food and culture were great... but I don't think I really understand the hype. 

For some reason I was picturing the menu to have 25 different types of soup dumplings... and all different kinda of weird dishes. The menu is pretty much like most other chinese restaurants, and there are only two different choices of soup dumplings: Pork and Crab. 

We ordered crispy duck, pork noodles, and both dim sum options. 

The pork dumplings were really good; neither of us cared for the crab. The duck was good, as were the pork noodles. 

I was excited to come here, and no I'm not disappointed, but I wish they had more options for the dim sum... be creative!",1
"Came here on a weekend for dinner. There was a long line, but I appreciated that the workers kept things moving so we didn't have to wait too long (maybe ~20 minutes for a table for 2). The process of getting a table may not be intuitive, but you have to go in the restaurant to check-in with a worker, who'll give you a number. They'll call out the number when a table for your party is ready so you'll need to stay close to the restaurant while waiting. The menu is pretty extensive. We tried the pork soup dumplings and fried rice cakes - both were delicious, prices were reasonable, and service was fast.",1
"Indeed is all about the soup dumplings. HmmMmmmm I can go for some right now. It'll warm up this popsicle body of mine!

A bit hard to find and community tables can throw people off, but endure the wait! It's worth it. I was always told that I had to try their dumplings (I was never specifically told it was a soup dumpling) so in my mind I'm like what's so special about another dumpling, but yes soup dumplings are a unique invention.

First you take a bite off the top exterior of the dumpling. Second you taste some of that savory broth. Third you pour in some vinegar sauce and chow down!

Let's refocus! Our group of 5 also ordered their shanghai noodles, bean curd, and kung pao chicken. Everything was flavorful and tasty! Extremely enjoyed all of it and love that the chicken in the kung pao were small vs the naturally large sizes they often come in.

Worth the wait! 

P.s. service sub-par. They seriously want you in and out especially when it's really busy.",1
"The xiao long bao aka soup dumplings on their own are ""as good as it gets."" Everything else is decent but not remarkable. The sauteed snow pea leaves and Shanghai noodles didn't leave too much of an impression, though I liked the smokiness of the noodles. It's a NYC institution and shouldn't be missed. But aside from its most well-known dish, the other offerings don't warrant the long lines.",1
"A great NYC Chinatown pick. 

Step 1: Go in and get sat down next to some tourists or locals.

Step 2: You can look at the menu, but you already know you came here for the xiaolongbao soup dumplings. Take too long and waiters will start offering recommendations and might even order for you. If you ask for a dish that takes 15 min to prepare, alternatives will be suggested. 

Step 3: Promptly receive your food. Eat dumplings way too fast and burn your mouth. The pain is worth it, because they are pretty good. Some of the dishes you ordered may or may not arrive, but you don't care too much as you are already pretty full.

Step 4: Pay, leave, look forward to coming back.",1
"This is a bit (but not really) of a coincidence that this review of Joe's Shanghai follows the review of the ""world famous"" Din Tai Fung http://www.yelp.com/biz/din-tai-fung-two-arcadia

But I did come to Joe's a couple weeks ago in my most recent trip to NYC. My friend (actually it was her sister) raved about this place and insisted we go before I left... so we did.

Because they would only seat us once the entire party was present (which is actually most excellent -- unless you're rollin' with laggers), there was a bit of a wait.

Once seated, we ordered more food than we could handle (a couple/few orders of the dumplings, noodles, rice, eggplant, and another vegetable dish).

These dumplings (aka xiao long baos), if they went head-to-head with those of Din Tai Fung, would win based on three primary factors:
- The Size Factor: Joe is bigger than Din
- The Skin Factor: Joe had slightly thicker skin (which I prefer) and it was a bit better cooked (Din's usually feels a minute or two undercooked -- for my taste)
- The Juice Factor: Joe's juice, or rather soup, is for more than Din's. Perhaps do to the Size Factor, Joe's soup easily fills up the white ""chinese"" soup spoons... easily.

All in all. Solid.",1
"Love their soup dumplings! 

The wait can get long when it's during lunch or dinner time but it is worth the wait. If you are in a rush call in and get it for take out. Takes about 20 minutes and they give everything even the sauce! I make sure I stop here every time I go to New York",1
First time at the new location. I have always frequented the pell st location for numerous years. The new place is def nice. The food is fantastic as always and the service is great. I will continue to come here cause I love the soup dumplings. On a side note to bad the flushing location closed.,1
My signicant other- who is from Shanghai- says this is one of the most authentic in NY.  I guess I will believe her.,1
"First visit was with super-picky sibling and grumpy, unadventurous children. Wildly successful. We had 2 orders of soup dumplings, shrimp noodles, tofu + veggies and a couple other items. Can't wait to return - sans family. Great service, too!",1
I was excited for my first visit to Joe's Shanghai to try their soup dumplings and they did not disappoint!  They were absolutely amazing!  So much flavor and I'm already looking forward to my next trip to NYC to have them again. We also had the fried dumplings and scallion pancakes. Both were the best we've ever had. Make this a stop and you won't regret it.,1
"My friend has been going here for years and brought me here to try it for the first time. Tea was readily available and very comforting while enjoying the turnip cakes, which were perfectly crispy and the pork dumplings, which were flavorful and delicious. 

I'm usually not a fan of Chinese food, but this place really changed my mind. And the prices are very reasonable (cash only though). I will definitely be coming back. Just make sure to go a little earlier, since the place can fill up pretty quickly.",1
"Slurp Slurp.

The dumplings are literally made for Giants, or persons of really big mouths. I wished i took a picture of the dumpling placed on the spoon so you can see how enormous it was. But trust me, they're huge! 

I get disappointed a lot by XLB at almost every restaurants I've been to because 1) its too dry to be called a XLB or 2) its not meaty and flavorful.  However, cravings were definitely satisfied here! The dumplings (or what NY ppl refer to as buns) are full of flavor and broth!
Between the two of us, we got the regular pork XLB and the crab XLB. If you're not a fan of roe, you wouldn't like the crab, but lucky for me.. I love roe and it was the best XLB I've ever had in my life. Din Tai Fung (from HK, LA, Seattle & the Bay Area) does not even come close to Joe's Shanghai. 

So glad that my best friend knew her way around and insisted that we arrive prior to opening time since the lines were starting to pile up. We got there ~15 mins earlier, and were the 10th party in line. 

Next time I'm in town, Joe, I'm coming for you!",1
"I come here quite a lot and really thought I wrote a review, but I guess not.

Most of the time when I come here there is a wait. HoweverI came here for an early lunch with my best friend around 11:30am and we've got seated right away. But later when it was really lunch time, the restaurant was packed.

My best friend wanted to order 2 orders of the soup dumplings and I told him we might not finish all of our food. His response was ""I can share everything with you, but when it comes to these soup dumplings I am greedy and I prefer not to share."" And yea, we ended up ordering 2 orders and a noodle dish. Finished all the dumplings and doggy bagged the noodles. 

So yes, soup dumplings are not meant to be shared because they are THAT good!",1
"Great food!
Still on the high end side! Still affordable without embarrassing friends! The steamed meat bao live up to its name! Don't like it cos they only take cash! That's how they pass the savings from credit card fees!?",1
"I really like the food here. The place is always busy especially on weekends. The line can get long sometimes, but the food is delicious and price is good!",1
"Holy cow, this place is madness! 

It's a relatively small spot and it seemed that literally all of Manhattan (myself included) required soup dumplings on a Saturday afternoon. Shoe up and get a number - you'll probably be seated with other groups if your party is less than 6. They also won't even talk to you unless your whole group is there and yes, they make you prove it. They turn tables like the place is on fire!

Inside is hot, chaotic and incredibly noisy. Settle in and order away - but know that things here are large so maybe order a little less. Of course, I didn't realize that and had way too much in front of me! Their soup dumplings were excellent - an order will definitely fill a person up because they're big, plump and filled with scalding broth. I had pork dumplings as well which were plenty good but definitely focus on the soup dumplings. 

Reasonable prices, super fast service and a definite Chinatown experience.",1
"I was visiting New York for the weekend and this was on my list of eats to try.  This ended up being my favorite food of the weekend, so freaking good!!!  We heard it'd be less crowded for lunch so we decided to go then, but there was still a pretty decent sized crowd waiting outside.  We were starving and almost didn't wait, but boy am I glad that we did.  Their xiao long baos were some of the best I've had.  You know it'll be good when the pouch is sagging with juice.  Did I mention we were starving?  So we ordered the pork chop noodles, green onion pancake, and 3 steamers of xiao long baos....might have gone a little overboard.  My favorites were both the pork and crab xiao long baos and green onion pancake.  It was kind of hectic in the restaurant and be prepared to make friends cuz you'll probably end up sitting at a big table with strangers, French in our case.  It's definitely a sit down, eat some awesome food, and say bye kinda joint.  I still dream of their xiao long baos though.",1
"Best soup dumplings. Ever.

The pork and crab xiao long bao are so good, you'll want to name your firstborn after them :P",1
"Excellent food!  Well worth the wait.  My wife had dinner at Joe's while we were in NYC for New Years after doing some research on Yelp.  We waited outside for 45 minutes in the cold and the rain.  My wife was one step away from killing me because she was miserable.  Once we made it inside the crowded restaurant we placed our order and the service was fast.  The waiter was not the friendliest but that's NY.  We had the dumplings for an appetizer.  They were absolutely AWESOME! We had General Tso's Chicken, Fried Rice, Green Beans, and Chicken Kunpao.  Everything was great.  My wife actually said the time in the rain was worth the awesome food.  Highly recommend it to anyone visiting NYC.",1
"Joe's is a classic Chinatown restaurant particularly for those people who are huge fans of the ""soup dumplings"" that are the big draw for those who like Shanghainese cuisine.  I don't eat pork, so I don't eat the soup dumplings, but my wife makes us go there every time we can so she can get her fix.

Other than the dumplings, Joe's is a pretty standard Chinatown restaurant, with a big menu filled with dishes (of all types of Chinese cuisines) where some dishes will be great and some will be greasy and underwhelming.  The place is crowded and noisy, with communal tables, so be prepared for that experience if you go there.  

That said, it's a solid restaurant for the area, and you pretty much get what you expect. And if you're into the soup dumplings, this is the place to get them.",1
"SOUP DUMPLINGS! I'm not particularly a fan of sharing tables with complete strangers. I honestly do not think that anything else is really that special and stands out as much as what it's known for, soup dumplings. A must stop if you are visiting in the winter! The wait is pretty long, but it's worth every second!",1
These soup dumplings have no competition. Hands down best in the states!  Try the veggie duck too. It's mushrooms wrapped in tofu skin.,1
"Stopped by on a Sunday evening, had to wait about 20 minutes, you'll probably end up sharing a big table if you're a smaller party than 10. 

Nomz: Came here for the soup dumplings, had the pork ones, if it's just two people I would recommend one pork dumplings and something else. Personally, I think only having the dumplings gets repetitive, but you do you. 
Had the crispy noodles with beef and it was really tasty, would get again! Also have had the Shanghai noodles with chicken, which lacked flavor to me, prefer the crispy ones. 

Service: This place is busy but they are on top of your orders and water, fast moving waiters. 

Ambiance: It's nice, lots of round tables and two seaters, minimalistic light brown wood, well lit place. 

Nope or Dope: Dope, this is where I get my soup dumpling fix for now :)",1
"I finallyyyyyy had an opportunity to try Joe's Shanghai and I was beyond excited. I have read countless reviews about this restaurant and was looking forward to my meal.

After waiting for one of their tables of 4 (the restaurant is mostly communal seating) we made our way into the establishment and took a peak at the menu.

We started off by ordering their famous soup dumpling's. I had never had anything like them before and we all really enjoyed the dish. 

We then moved on to a spicy chicken dish, a pork noodle dish and a large sea bass serving.

All of the dishes were unique and filled with flavor. I especially enjoyed the sea bass, it was a large portion, the saucy was tasty and the fish was cooked to perfection.

Hundred's of people before me have written positive review's of Joe's. This place truly is great, definitely check it out.",1
"So U know why u r coming here...AAAAND you know the dumplings are good here (as long as they aren't sticking to the bottom of the steamer), i think they added more crab to the crab/pork ones!!!, and you are going to wait for them duh... but what else should you order?

My advice: 
since u r probably sitting at one of the communal tables next to another Asian Chinese person is to ask what THEY like that is different, or typical shanghai style food.  I do that each time I go to Joes and never have been dissapointed!  We had shanghai seafood noodle soup, spring roll, shredded pork and pickled cabbage soup, subgum fried rice cakes, sesame chicken (for the scared out of towner) and shanghai fried noodles with chicken.  All the family style portions had loads of veggies.  We certainly didn't starve and had a great time sharing and talking with the 2 couples at our table from Hong Kong and getting married and moving to Indiana--what country is that in again?? Our bill...less than 60$ w/ tip included...love that!

My only beef is that the waiter sees white man and automatically tries to steer me toward ""safe"" foods that typical american people would eat.  i've been to china and spent some time eating the food and i love the cuisine, the weirder the better for me!!  so go out on a limb yelpers!!",1
"Delicious and always know what you are getting, we have no dined in since they changed locations but the food is always great! The hot and sour soup is not the same sny more though :[",1
"The hype is real. Their infamous soup dumplings delivered. We got both the pork and pork/crab and their scallion pancakes and another fried lobster dish but who cares about their other dishes right? Let's get straight to business. 

In the West Coast, where I come from, Din Tai Fung is the place to go for soup dumplings. Which one was better you ask? Well honestly it comes down to taste and preference. Joe's Shanghai's soup dumblings are bigger and filled with more soup! YUMMM!!! 


BUT...
It was also more oily and heavy as well. I prefer the clean taste of Din Tai Fung but for oil, lard lovers, I can see why Joe's Shanghai reigns on top in NYC!",1
"Joe's Shanghai is a staple for New York tourists that are looking for something other than cheese cake factory. Definitely get the soup dumplings. There is always a wait, I recommend putting your name in and going across the street for a foot massage while you wait.",1
"We hear that the place gets pack quick, so we arrived before they were even open!  We stood in the cold weather for some good xao long bao!  The place did get pack quick when they opened though, so come early!  The service was fairly fast, we had the following:

Pork soup dumplings - steamy hot porky, rich soup with a splash of vinegary soy.. yum

Pork and crab soup dumplings - almost the same, with just a hint of crab, delicious still

Be careful when biting into it, I was overexcited and ended up burning myself.. but so good!!",1
"I won't boast too much about this spot because it seems like everyone was already put on game.

The best Chinese food I've had to this day!!! I mean, it's tough to beat like corner Chinese stores in the hood but this was such an amazing experience. I'm usually not this impressed with Chinese food.

We went for lunch and was seated immediately (it was a Monday tho). The service was prompt and convenient since we were hungover & starving lol.

We got the chicken corn soup, veggie dumplings, and the sesame chicken. Everything tasted as expected but super fresh and flavorful. 

Can't wait to return.",1
"Due to the rain and colder weather on a weekday morning, my friend and I didn't have to wait in line for their famous soup dumplings. It was a little weird being seated in a corner of a table and sharing it with a couple since there was plenty of space and tables around us. I supposed they did that just in case the place suddenly becomes busy. 

The menu was a bit overwhelming with the many options listed and I actually had to ask the waiter to point out where the soup dumplings were listed. They have two kinds of soup dumplings: crab and pork. Each kind came with 8 dumplings sooo...we were stuffed by the end. These were 8 large dumplings so definitely bring people to share them with. For the price and how large each dumpling was, I thought it well-worth it. I am by no means an expert in soup dumplings but they were really good especially with the black-ginger sauce.

In general, I am not a fan of Schezuan food. We also ordered a spicy beef dish (sliced) with bean sprouts but the sauce was too much. It wasn't spicy either which was disappointing. Overall, very good soup dumplings and recommend it if you're in the area!",1
"If you want classic, authentic soup dumplings, this is the spot you go to. The seat is communal style, so if you come with a smaller group, or two or three people, you will probably share a table with others. Which is totally fine and actually adds to the experience in my opinion. My personal favorite thing to eat here are the pork soup dumplings, however everything else is great. There's usually a wait cause it's a popular spot, but if you go there earlier than you'd ideally like to eat, you can deal with that. It's in the heart of chinatown down a little crowded alley, and you really get the full experience being there. The walls are lined with pictures of famous people who've gone and eaten there as well.",1
Came here again with friends for Sunday lunch. Soup dumplings are still amazing (none broken this time :) The service isn't bad but the way the talk to you is a little rude...,1
"I love their soup dumplings! Many would argue that it's a tourist trap but what is a tourist trap if it delivers good, consistent food? 

Always order the crabmeat dumplings - you won't regret sucking the living juices out of the poor dumpling! Then sip on some soda before you go for round 2 because that's how the Chinese do it! 

Other choices are not necessary at this establishment if you can fill up on dumplings all the way. Just a suggestion!",1
"This place definitely lives up to it's hype. The xiao long bao is absolutely fantastic, best I've ever had. They are bigger than what is served at other restaurants, and they hold a lot more soup. I always make the mistake of trying to stuff a whole one into my mouth, having the soup explode,  and struggling not to spit it out as the hot soup sears the inside of my mouth. I can't help it, it's just THAT good.

Definitely the culinary highlight of my trip to NYC.",1
Always amazing. Always a long wait but worth it. The food is amazing and authentic. The staff is very friendly as well. We come here from Westchester at least three times a year.,1
"Pretty solid for churning out soup dumplings. I also enjoy their lo meins and their eggplant with garlic dish. It's always crazy busy so it's likely you may have to share a table, but for the most part, the wait isn't unbelievable. I'll always come back!",1
Love their style noodles. Choice of ingredients can be improved with larger pieces. Good flavor.,1
"This place was highly recommended and confirmed by all the great reviews. Waited for almost an hour and then had to share a table with 4 others while we were a party of 5. That's 9 total. Fortunately, the table is next to the wall of celebrities. 
They pack you in tight so there's no room to maneuver to take photos or at least be courteous to your shared dining parties. 
All of this was well worth the wait. The pork and crab dumplings were to die for. The dumpling skins were not thick which can be too overbearing and takes away the overall flavor. Very good soup and meat flavors. There is nothing frozen about this dish. To enhance this dish, we ordered a side dish of sauteed mushrooms. It was cooked to perfection and not salty like most Chinese joints I've encountered. 
As busy as they are, there is no sense of rush. The staff are attentive and quick to respond. The place is dated and needs a cleaning but don't let that be a hindrance in dining here. That's why the price is so reasonable. Don't fix it if it ain't broken!
Would highly recommend and return. Just wish they had one close to me in CA.",1
"I am coming here every. single. time. I visit NY from now on. This place is absolutely fantastic for lunch, and so affordable! 

I came with my boyfriend for a late lunch on a weekday. We got seated at around 2pm, after about a 20 min wait. I think that it's really hard to get a table for big parties, so you will have better luck coming in small groups. Either way, be prepared to maybe share a table with someone else, because this place is ALWAYS busy and full. We shared a table with another family of 4 that had 2 young children, and I preoccupied myself during the wait by watching the adorable little one eat his xiao long bao :) 

We ended up ordering 1 noodle soup to share ($5 - pork and pickled cabbage - SO MUCH NOODLE!) and 2 orders of the xiao long bao ($10 for 16 - such a great deal since where I come from, they are often almost $1 each). We also got the scallion pancake, which was really crispy and came with a delicious and surprisingly sweet sauce. Lastly, we got some mixed vegetables for $5 - I had to negotiate with my boyfriend on this one because he doesn't like veggies much...

It was a completely satisfying and filling meal for only $28 including tax and tip. I would recommend just buying a ton of things off the appetizers and sharing, because the actual dishes are pricey and are pretty big portions, so you wouldn't get to try as many different things because they will fill you up fast. 

I can't wait to come back again. The xiao long bao = perfection.",1
"Best Xiao Long Bao ever!
Whenever I come up from Atlantic City to New York, this place is definitely on our to do list. Crab ones are definitely my favorite.
I love their scallion pancakes, and this one soup. I forget what they call it but its the one with the bamboo shoots, snow peas and pork. Very light and delicious.

They also let you order the dumplings raw to take home, but I always find that the skin never turns out restaurant quality when I cook them. Much rather trek back to New York and have them done right with their superior dumpling cooking powers.",1
"Have had xiaolongbao in Seattle, Vancouver, Chicago, San Francisco, and Dallas. Of all these places, Joe's Shanghai is in my top 2 of favorite XLB. 

For 5.95 you get 6 large XLB filled with delicious seething hot soup and ball of meat. It was so delicious that I returned three days in a row and I was only in NYC for 4 days so that's saying something. We ordered three orders of XLB and that is all we ordered from the menu since everything else paled in comparison to delicious XLB. 

Be warned that there always seems to be a minimum wait time of 20 minutes to be seated. There is always a line outside the restaurant as the restaurant is quite tiny for the amount of people that love frequenting this restaurant. 

Nothing too impressive with the decor. Typical Chinatown restaurant decor.",1
"First time in Chinatown and this place is apparently a gem, so we had to check it out!! 

We went as a group and were there to share items, so unfortunately didn't get to check out the large scale ""entrees"", but we got a couple orders of the dumplings and also scallion pancakes. Although I didn't have the dumplings, my friends were more than thrilled by them, and were surprised at how filling!! I had the scallion pancakes and while oily, they tasted delicious! 

This place isn't the best for a sit down long dinner, it's extremely popular and so, they work a very quick ship. They'll have you in and out but honestly, didn't even matter! It's just part of the experience. Definitely would be back to try more of the vegetarian options!",1
"The best soup dumplings around!

Get cozy sitting next to some strangers. This is the sorta place where they fill up any and every seat. I enjoyed chatting with some tourists from Texas!

A great spot to stop in while in chinatown!",1
"This time I tried stuff other than the soup dumplings, and they were great! Try the fish- delicious!",1
"Very good place. Ordered takeout and drove to NJ. Food was still warm and quite tasty. We ordered Sesame Chicken, General Tsos, and spring rolls. All were quite good.",1
"It's 10pm hungry from a trip to Woodbury commons and coming to this kind of a dingy place but when you sit down to devour this pork dumplings, it heaven !!! At 11 people are still coming in!",1
"I've come to New York several times and this is still my favorite dumplings place. I don't mind the long line, I don't mind the bingo game the hostess plays, I don't mind the cold or the heat while I wait. I come, share a table, have my dumplings, if it's cold outside, the best Hong Kong style soup, I pay and I leave. Great experience granted.",1
"The best soup dumplings I've ever had! You'll most likely have to wait in order to eat, but I promise it's well worth it. A little crowded since you share tables with other parties (round tables that for up to 10 people) but overall very fast service. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for authentic food and amazing dumplings!",1
Yummy yummy goodness in my tummy!!  This place is the real deal!  I have been to Shanghai China restaurants and the food here is just as good!  Highly recommend the soup dumplings with ginger vinegar. Enjoy!!  Chinatowns best!,1
"Every time I go to visit my cousins in New York, my top food request is Joe's. Soup dumplings are amazing!!! Someone recently told me that he didn't like them, and had he been sitting next to me I would have kicked him right in the head. WTF?! Who doesn't love soup dumplings?!?!?! 

Last time we went a random dude at our table ordered 3-4 orders of soup dumplings just for himself....a man after my own heart. Yes, they are that good, but their other food is just as delicious. I feel like you can't go wrong no matter what you order as long as you order the soup dumplings first. I almost gasped when the other random people at our table declined the dumplings. Again. WTF!? Who doesn't love soup dumplings?!?!?!",1
"This one deserves 5 stars.  A NYC classic.  There's a reason for the ""insane waits"" and ""long lines"".  You don't get a better soup dumpling in the city.  Scallion pancakes are amazing.  If you're in a small group, be prepared to be sat with strangers.",1
"I don't have much new insight considering that this is review number 392, but I just wanted to gush about my Chinese New Years lunch. 

It was sooooo good. Some of the tastiest pan-fried seafood noodles I've ever had. Their scallion pancakes were flaky fried perfection. Among the 5 ppl I went with, we ordered several dishes, including shredded roasted chicken over cold peanut noodles, sesame beef and the much beloved soup dumplings. Somehow, after splitting the tab, I only had to throw down $6 -- incredible for the food coma I soon fell into.

Not a dish passed by my table that I wasn't tempted to snag (good thing for will power).",1
"Was recommended to this place when I asked friends about dumplings/dim sum type food. They accept cash only!! 18% tip is added to every tab

This place does offer cart style dim sum but a wide array of Chinese food. Quick and easy service. We got seated right away for two in the afternoon. Our table and seat was not wiped down however so there were stray noodles around when we were seated. 

We got the pork soup dumplings which were nice and juicy. None had popped on the way to the table and had a lot of soup in them. They taste best hot so I was happy to have that experience as they became less appetizing as the meal went by. The soup was pretty good but I have had better soup dumplings. You get 8 for about $8. 

We also got the gumsub pan fried noodles for about $17 and the portion was generous. Loved the mixed seafood and noodles but the sauce was on the salty side which was inevitable looking at how dark brown the sauce was.

Overall, it was a tasty experience but had some hiccups between table cleanliness and salty flavor.",1
"My friend treated me to A-ha concert and a night at the Crown Plaza in Time Square. I was thrilled not to mention shop heaven! In return, I'd treat her out to dinner and lunch for all the good times! Days before our big trip to NYC, she was talking about Joe's Shanghai's dumplings and how WE HAVE TO EAT LUNCH there before we come back to Boston!! It sounded like lunch was the most important thing of this trip, never mind that this is A-ha's last concert in the States. 

We go to the dumpling joint and this place only takes CASH! So we head back out the door and search for a couple blocks for a ATM. As soon as we sat down, the waiter immediately asked ""what kinda dumpling you want?"" LOL! This place knows they are the best in this category! LOL! It's a small and very busy restaurant so expect to share a table w/strangers and be rushed out to make room for new diners. Don't expect to lounge around. 

0 Stars for customer service. I eat at many Chinese restaurants and customer service is not the most important priority which is a typical experience for me in any Chinatown in any state. Basically, waiters just serve your food with an indifferent attitude. But this place has ONE of the worse waiters. I'm talking about this one specific waiter who had the worse attitude. The sad thing is NY has this service charge which customers are forced to pay no matter how the bad service is. This joint automatically rewards this jerk 15%. I asked for a little take out box to put my leftovers in and this douche gave me a ""geezus christ look"" with a crooked smirk and to add on top of that, sound effects that came from smacking his gum. A very small task to do which he has done a million of times before, it wasn't as if I was asking him to sacrifice his life. My God! This was all displayed in front of me and my friend. It was like living out a comedy and the joke is on us because we're going to get screwed with the 15% service charge! Haha! This is one reason why restaurants should not implement a service charge. 

We ordered the famous steamed bun or most folks call it a dumpling. It's deceiving when the menu says bun because I'm thinking it's bread like dough with meat inside. This is not a soup dumpling that floats in a broth. It's a thin skin bun that is stuffed w/meat and with a bit of broth inside. I think of it as dim-sum. It's steamed in a bamboo basket. The broth inside steams the meat and infuses it with flavor. Each order comes with 8 dumplings. The dumpling is medium size and one person can finish one order. 

This is what we ordered: 

3 stars for shredded turnup cake. I was expecting a square white jelly like turnup cake but instead, it was a puff pastry stuffed with shredded white carrot (law-bok) . It was very bland and the filling had no taste or filling. I would pass on this appetizer but if you do get this , dip in soy sauce or something. You get two ""cake"" per order. 

1 star for Cold Noodles in Sesame Oil which is exactly what it was. Greasy and tasteless. I would DEFINITELY pass on this one. To make this better, they should add some kind of seasoning, maybe chopped green onion and throw in some REAL sesame! It look like greasy black noodles. 

5 stars for Crab Meat w/Pork Meat Steamed Bun (dumpling). It was all made fresh. You can definitely taste the crab and it even had crab roe. The combination of the pork and crab were very delicious. If you like the seafood taste, then this is something you should order! 

5 stars for the Pork Steamed Bun (dumpling). It tasted great and the pork was lean and had the right combination seasoning. 

The hardest part to eating these dumplings is not breaking it apart before you put it in your mouth or you'll loose the broth inside it. 

Despite the bad customer service, I highly recommend ordering the dumplings!!",1
"Even in 40 degree weather, there were at least 20 people waiting. It took approximately 15 minutes to get a small table for two, and seating felt a bit cramped. I came with high hopes to try their soup dumplings (which is what Joe's Shanghai is pretty much known for). Not to say that it wasn't good, I'm just not sure that it matched up with all the popularity. Before we finished our food, the waiter dropped off the check with 15% tip and tax already included. Overall, food was decent but don't expect to stay there for too long.",1
"I'm so glad that my first soup dumpling experience was at Joe's. Why I waited so long to try soup dumplings is beyond me! I ordered the garlic sauce dish and scallion pancakes in addition to their famous soup dumplings. From my first and very last bite, I enjoyed each moment throughly. The food came out quickly and servers were friendly. 

When my friend and I arrived around rush hour, there wasn't a line/crowd but we still waited about 5 minutes to be seated. By the time we were headed out though, it started to get a bit crowded-- especially for a Tuesday night. I was in the area that following Saturday and remember seeing a line going down the street to enter so your best bet it to get there as early as you can because they don't accept reservations. And don't forget to bring CASH! :)",1
"Best Xiao Long Bao in USA!! It is better than ding tai fung  for sure!! a lot soup inside every bao!
i went there at least twice a week for the 2-3weeks I am in NY. it is SO GOOD!!!
I wish they have a shop here in LA.",1
"Food was delicious. Of course had the pork soup dumplings. Clams were good. So we're the green beans.  Service is fast but like most asian restaurants, don't expect warm and fuzzy.

Bathroom was really unkept. Someone should be looking into this.",1
"This past weekend, I was walking around china town with my brother looking for a non-sketchy place to grab dinner and ended up here. We sat with a fun, large family who ordered the jellyfish appetizer and dared us to try it. Not something I would have EVER ordered on my own...but it actually didnt taste too bad! For entrees we got the orange beef and general tso's chicken and both were very good. Portions are pretty large- we ended up taking some home. Their rice is some of the best I've had with chinese food. My only complaint was that both dishes had minimal vegetables...I think there were only 4 pieces of broccoli in the chicken dish. 

I like that they give you tea before eating and oranges after on the house. Unfortunately it was WAY too hot to get the soup dumplings which they are known for, so I definitely need to come back and try those.",1
"The best pork soup dumplings in NYC by far!!
Didn't expect it when I went in, but was blown away by it. 
However, all there other foods are sub-par, nothing special.

But do get there fried bread with condensed milk. yum!",1
Finally came to try the famous soup dumplings- they were the best I've ever had. Very juicy and just the right size. Also tried the shanghai fired noodles which were delicious but pretty greasy. I came on a Tuesday afternoon and the place was packed it was like we were seated with the table next us. They could use an update on decor tables are close and the pink and green lighting makes it very dim inside.,1
"Had a great experience! I was escorted right away to my table! Clean and the waiters were very attentive. I tried the dumpling soup, which was delicious! I highly recommend it!",1
"Some of the best Chinese food you'll find in the city for cheap. You absolutely must get the soup dumplings. They are absolutely delicious. Everything else on the menu to fantastic-- fried rice, chicken and broccoli are two staples although the more adventurous among us would find ample to keep you happy there. 

A few things to note if this is your first visit. 
1) The food is made for sharing. You'll get better value with more people. Meat dishes tend to start above $10. Dumplings are still super cheap, if I remember correctly, they are less than $7 for 8 or so. 

2) You will have to wait at least 30 minutes for a seat. No reservations. Its that popular, and for good reason. 

3) You may be seated at a table with other customers not in your party. Its weird but you'll get over it when the food arrives. 

4) Cash only. 

I would give this 5 stars were it not for some of the ambiance related things. Food is excellent. I highly recommend.",1
"This place is proof that not all Asian food tastes the same.  The flavors were exceptional, the wait want bad, and the service was great.  We came in at lunch on Sunday and it was fantastic.  We had a beef dish, calamari, duck, and shrimp fried rice.  All excellent.  We also had the pork dumpling appetizer which was awesome.  They also serve Tsing Tao, need I say more?  Definitely on the list for a return visit.",1
"The dumplings are incredible.  We also had a few other dishes and they are also very good!  
The service is mediocre, waiters were quick with you and they are quick to get rid of you as they want to turn the tables.   The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the service.    
BTW 15% TIP was included in our check.",1
"My friends and I took a recent visit to NYC and we were really excited to try this restaurant in Chinatown, and it did not disappoint! I personally got the Steamed Veggie Dumplings and the Veggie Fried Rice and both were sooo good! Everyone at the table was raving over the quality of the food. The service was great and the food was brought out quickly. The restaurant itself is really pretty inside, and we didn't wait at all (there were 4 of us and we went around 4 PM on Thursday). Overall, I would totally recommend this place!",1
Amazing!!!! The soup pork/crab dumplings were absolutely fabulous!!!! We lucked out and got in without a wait. We sat down at a table for 6 (there was 4 of us) and then immediately sat 2 more people with us! No some people might not like this.... I loved it!! The women we sat with were Asian ( and from LA)and had specifically sought out this resteraunt for soup dumplings.... they said this was the best!!! End result .... a must go!!!,1
"On a cold winter's day, there's nothing better than some decently priced Asian comfort food to warm you up like Joe's Soup Dumplings. This is the only reason I go to Joe's - because they are usually really busy, and the tables are pretty cramped. If you go during a busy hour (like dinner) and are a small party, you could be seated with another group of people at their shared, common round tables. It's the only way they can keep their queue moving...but if you don't feel obliged to talk to your neighbors (IF this happens to you), then it's totally worth it once those Soup Dumplings hit your belly.",1
"I was skeptical of the cheesy name, but am really glad my friend took me here. Having sampled all the best XLB places in SF (and hacing tried Ding Tai Fung), I can assure you this blows everything out the water. Well that is if you like BIG FAT XLBS with not just pools of soupiness but giant lakes. These are true gushers.

We got to the place around 11 am on a Saturday and were able to sit down right away (possibly because of our small party size?) at a communal table. The waiter immediately set down a teapot, and we immediately ordered one ""long"" of regular pork XLBs and one of crab and a pork & preserved veggie rice cake dish. Althougher with 2 Tsingtaos, our bill was around $30.

I was definitely more of a fan of the pork. The crab was defintely decadent and the broth tasted like roe...which I can appreciate but am not the biggest fan of. The filling was very sizable and though the wrappers/flavors were not as delicate as high-end XLBs (aka DTF's), they are very satisfying and good for hungry tummies. Same with the pork. Having tried some terrible XLBs, I can really appreciate how 1) the wrappers don't fall apart when you lift them 2) the filling is not falling apart because they have been frozen 3) the wrapper is not hard, evidence of freezing 4) the filling is big enough so the wrapper-filling ratio is all skewed 5) there is actually enough soup to call them ""soup dumpings"" 6) the flavors are pretty authentic to Chinese food in China. See how bad XLBs can be?",1
"This place is SO GOOD!!!! I wish there were more dumpling types bc the dumplings here were amazing!!! We got the pork soup, pork fried and crab! We also got orange chicken, Shanghai noodles, scallion pancake, fried rice and veggies! The wait was very long so I would get here early and not go weekends if it's avoidable! It really hit the spot and was super filling and yummy after a long day walking through nyc!",1
"During jury duty at a nearby court someone recommended the dim sum and it was easily the best I've had anywhere (SF, Boston, NYC). It's a cramped and hurried place, but that's to be expected in Chinatown. Since I was by myself I got seated along with 4 other small parties at a big table. Quick service and very attentive and lots of current celebrity pictures on the wall. Now, the best part. 

I ordered the steamed pork buns as my meal since it was just me and didn't want leftovers. They looked very different than the steamed buns I'm used to (the denser, fluffier kind with the kind of bbq flavored strips of pork). These were soft, thin, and filled with thinly ground pork in a broth that was rich, tender, and succulent. If I had no qualms, I would've slurped the broth left on my fish. I did my best by just taking spoonfuls. I hardly use ""life changing"" when describing food but this goes on my top 10 dishes of all time. Will definitely come back.",1
"5 stars for their soup dumpling. It's simply the best of its kind. Pork is better in my opinion.
I wouldn't order anything else (their other dishes are at the 3-3.5/5 level only). Don't order the fried fresh fish, it tasted like sadness and not fresh. I would just save my stomach for the soup dumplings",1
"This place is pretty cool for lunch. If you're not there with 8 of your friends, they will sit you with some random people at a big 10 person table most likely with tourists. It's a whole other experience this way, and I'm a big fan.

My friend and I shared a lot of small plates including the crab meat and pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao). Which were all delicious! The Quail quarters were the typical slightly overcooked, crispy skinned deliciousness. And I'm from NorCal, so I haven't had or haven't been exposed to the fried turnip ball that is full of WIN. 

Also try the peanut noodles if you're not so adventurous. They are surprisingly awesome.",1
"Xiao Long Bao was AMAZING!  Some of the best I've ever had!   Careful or it will explode crazy hot broth in your mouth or your clothes.

We also had this garlicky broccoli (also AMAZING), sesame chicken, and fried rice.  I walked out with a garlic pork baby in my tummy, but it didn't bother me one bit.

One thing that is sort of a downside, you eat at a table with others...the others at our table were a little ""off"".  Just a forewarning.",1
"My favorite shanghai soup dumpling in nyc.  The crab and pork soup dumplings have a perfect balance of skin thinness, soup volume, soup richness (seafood sweetness), and substantive pork.

For beginners, either clamp or chopstick the tip at the top and place on to your spoon.  Bite a hole to the top or side, slurp the soup slowly, then eat the rest of it.  If you try to just pop it in your mouth, you will likely burn your tongue.  If they've been sitting for 5-10 minutes, then you can probably just pop them in your mouth without slurping the soup first, without worrying about burning.

Besides the dumplings, which I'll usually get 2 orders of 8 each, try the shanghai thick fried noodles, the seafood thick fried noodles, drunken chicken, and pork cutlet soup noodles.

As a minor dessert, red bean fried pancake.

Also, another Chinatown place that is quick, not rude, just quick.  They're not kicking you out, they're just trying to turn over as much as they can, don't take it the wrong way - but also don't try to take forever.  This isn't a 2-3 hr dinner date place.",1
"This is THE spot for dumplings in NYC! Recommended by a friend, we got here around 12:30 and were quickly seated. There are tons of servers and service here is super fast and efficient. They get you in and out. I knew I wanted the pork soup dumplings, but they weren't listed as such on the menu. The pork soup and the crab and pork soup dumplings were the first items on the menu, and if I recall correctly, I think they were listed as ""buns"". Either way, that's what I ordered and crossed my fingers it would be what I wanted. The waiter was very fast and I felt pressured when he was taking my order (maybe it was just me), and I wasn't sure if he thought that wasn't enough food, so i kept ordering. I ended up with way too much food and had leftovers, but try to remember that the soup dumplings are large and filling and you do get 8 per order. I also went with pan fried dumplings, which were good, and eggplant which was a  huge portion!",1
"Interesting place for dumplings. Unlike other places Around the area, this places takes aim time to be seated and get food orders. Seating consists of 2 or more parties at one table (sharing). It can be hit or miss depending one how much everyone orders. Dumplings are average but the crab meat dumpling is the highlight of this spot and never disappoints. Don't expect to go in and out as it takes a while. 

Food is good , space is small",1
"The crab soup dumplings are much better than pork! We three people had boiling fish, broiled duck and pork and shrimp. Not bad.",1
I have to say I haven't been to this place in a while so this review is probably not as relevant as others.  I've been to this location many times and I've always been impressed with their food.  It's simple Shanghainese.  Sure the wait staff is rude but it's NYC and wait staff are rude in Shanghai too.  The dumplings were always delicious and fresh.  Bring cash since they don't accept CC.,1
"For the west coasters: Joe's is better than DTF. The skin is thicker and chewier. AND it's only $5 a rack!!!!

For the first-timers: 
- grab a xiao long bao (XLB/soup dumpling) without breaking the skin
- put it on your spoon
- bite a hole at the base of the XLB, suck out all the soup (careful, it's hot!)
- add (vinegar/soy or hot) sauce and enjoy the rest of your XLB in one bite!
XLB are best while hot.

My sister and I enjoy the XLB so much we came here for lunch and dinner once (we're from out of town). 10 minute wait for lunch and 1.5 hour wait for dinner -- still worth it (y)",1
Great Chinese restaurant. Have the soup dumplings. They are outstanding. We ordered too much food and we're happy to take it home.,1
A hidden gem in Chinatown. It's in a small alley like location.  Expecting a wait during the evening. I did a Togo order and it took 20min.  Food was good but a bit pricey. Small place and if more than 10people it will be hard and annoying.,1
"Your run of the mill good Chinese place with great soup dumplings 
Tbh no place is good enough to wait for 3h but if you can get a table on time you're in good hands :)

Fast service, lots of food, reasonable price

Recommend the soup dumplings, while fish dish, Peking duck, beef schezwan style but maybe not the scallion pancakes 

They give oranges with the check which I love",1
"Soup dumplings are must have. Has lots of soup inside, not easy to make! We also had the crispy shredded beef, also highly recommended",1
"Came for a quick lunch with my mom; she loves soup dumplings and this is our go-to soup dumpling restaurant in Midtown. Despite being told that the wait would be about 40 minutes, we were seated and had ordered within 20 minutes.

We had an order of crab soup dumplings and one xue cai rou si mian (pickled greens & pork noodle soup). Both were delicious as usual. 

One comment: the portion sizes of the non-dumplings seem to have gotten smaller while the prices have increased.",1
Great dumplings the flushing location seems the best also the lamb shank is really good,1
I LOVE Joe's Shanghai. Must order the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes.  Kung pow chicken  and shrimp Lo Mein are also great. One of my favorite spots in Chinatown!,1
"The soup dumplings were amazing! The staff wasn't friendly, but they were very efficient. I will totally be coming back!",1
"Came here for dinner last night, and yes it lives up to the hype. They make excellent dumplings!

We had two servings of the soup dumplings and one serving of the fried dumplings, an order of spring rolls and some Singaporean Noodles with beef.

The place is a bit dive-y and very busy, but hey we are in China town and everything was tasty and very affordable, so two thumbs up!",1
Their crab soup dumplings are the best. Me and my friends get them at least 3 times per week. Absolutely delicious.,1
"Best crab soup dumplings this side of the pacific hands down. Yes the wait can get long at times but trust me when I say it's worth the wait. The soup dumplings are definitely on par u not better than the ones I've had in shanghai. Destination spot CHECK. Ps it's cash only, but food is extremely good and cheap.",1
"Delicious and juicy crab/pork dumplings.  I took a big bite and all the juice squirt out of my mouth.  This place is so popular there's a 1-2 hour wait depending on your party size on the weekend.  Lucky for us, we tried coming back on a weekday and no wait at all.  We also had Beef Tendon noodles...which was ok.

Definitely come here for the dumplings.",1
"Really can't say enough about how good this food is. I saw some people complaining about how they sat people together at tables, but i didn't mind it at all. 

You need to order the dumplings.  I also got the chicken lo mein so so so good. 

seriously.. Just GO!

oh yeah and CASH ONLY!",1
"They have the best soup dumplings & scallion pancakes.
However the new location was sooo loud, we couldn't even hear the person next to us at our own table",1
This spot was great. Me and a group of 3 (4 total) came here Sunday night. It was packed. Tables either come by 8 or 2. So be prepared to share tables. The food was insane. Sesame chicken dumplings (#9 and #10). Salt and pepper shrimp. Fat noodles (forgot name). The won ton soup was also good and comes family style. Highly recommended.,1
"I had heard a lot about Joe's Shanghai from friends and so some of us went to check it out around 10pm. Luckily, we found seating right away. I've heard that those who come at peak hours are not so lucky.

We had mostly soup dumplings (we ordered 3 orders of 8, or something like that) and the rest of the meal consisted of beef fried rice. I found the beef fried rice to be pretty average, but the soup dumplings were among the best I've ever had. I can't tell for sure if it was THE BEST I've ever had, because I've never gone to a place in which the majority of my meal consisted of soup dumplings. It could just be that I liked it here so much because I had so much of them. Nevertheless, the quality was very high.",1
"okay first of i NEED to get this off my chest: I am reviewing this on the xiao long bao's (XLB), not on the rest of the food.  YOU GO HERE TO GET THE XLBs!!!  NOT NECESSARILY ANYTHING ELSE!!!!  for the ppl who gave this a low rating, its usually because they expect everything else this restaurant gives to be excellent as well, but its only mediocre.  if i were to rate it based on everything (which i guess I should be doing) i would give it a 4.  but still, the XLBs are the best I have ever had.  really really good.",1
"BEST xiao long tang bao (Steamed soup dumpling: $5.95 for 8 pc)
BEST scallion pancake ($2.95)
BEST drunken chicken ($7.95)

No really, it's amazing how a well-renowned Chinese restaurant can serve all these excellent food at cheap prices! The star of course is the XLTB. Be careful when you pick up a dumpling so that you don't break it, because it is filled with hot delicious soup that you do not want to waste! Once you carefully placed it on your spoon, break it so your spoon will be filled with the soup within. 

Don't try to directly bite the XLTB like a normal dumpling! It will be a hot mess.

Be sure to get the golden pan-fried scallion pancake and the drunken chicken too! I haven't had a drunken chicken this good ever since my first drunken chicken dish in a high-end restaurant in Taiwan.

It's cash only and you may have to wait for a while so be prepared. If you are visiting NYC Chinatown, you need to eat a meal here especially if you want stellar XLTB!",1
"Absolutely the best soup dumplings I've ever had. I lkke Americanized Chinese food (white meat chicken!), so the menu is perfect for me. You may end up waiting a while for a table, but it'll be worth it.",1
"Of course the dumplings were great, but we were blown away by the whole crispy fish, which was incredibly flavorful.",1
"Delicious food, very affordable, quick waiting staff.
Cash only, doesn't serve hard liquor.
Try the scallion pancakes and of course the SOUP DUMPLINGS.",1
"One of the best Chinese restaurants in the city, but make sure to come with a small party or get ready to wait!  It's also best to come on a Monday evening to avoid the swarm of people. Here are some must eats:

1.  Soup dumplings (order them the second you sit down)
2.  Scallion pancakes (the best in the city)
3.  Shanghai flat noodles with pork
4.  Beef with scallions

As a general note the restaurant circles all of their best and most popular dishes, so just stick with those because the chef knows best!",1
"We went to Joe's Shanghai after the Interactive Van Gogh experience (thank you Yelp Elite community for those free tix!)

We ordered the soup dumplings with pork and crab meat, and we both thought they were delicious and well priced, as well. 

The kung Pao chicken -- somewhat of a basic normie choice -- was also appetizing. Really not the kind of the dish you'd expect them to screw up. It came with a side of white rice. 

The Szechuan noodles, however, were pretty plain, and we didn't think the stew was anything to write home about. However, the accompanying beef was just chewy enough and very tasty!

The service at Joe's Shanghai deserves a mention because it is mediocre. The hostess was kind, but the waiters pressured us into ordering right after we got there, and kept walking near our table after it was served, never asking about our meal, or offering more water as our glasses of water emptied out. Rozena says this type of a service is normal especially in Chinatown, but I think differently.",1
"The food at Joe's Shanghai was really great! Plus, for a restaurant in Chinatown, I was surprised at the design and upkeep of the atmosphere.

We were able to fit 11 people with no wait on a Tuesday and ordered a lot of food. I recommend the cold tofu and chow mein. We also got the peeking duck which was amazing!",1
"everything was superb! the soup dumplings are a must try, and i loved the bok choy. CASH ONLY!",1
"Soup dumplings... my kyrponite!  I was first introduced to this fabulous dish by a college friend from Taiwan.  Ever since then, I have been in a search for amazing soup dumplings.  Word thru the grapevine told me this place is the best! Unfortunately, by the time I went to visit Joe's I was already hooked on Din Tai Fung.  
I was on vacation meeting up a friend there, in which i was a bit late.  My friends had already ordered and once I arrived dumplings had already made its grand entrance.  Dumplings were a bit warm.  I was surprised to see the size of the dumplings.  I was use to the smaller Din Tai Fung dumplings.  I couldnt wait to try these.  I picked one up very carefully and proceeded to do my dumpling-eating ritual.

1. Pick up the dumpling by its tip
2. Dip dumpling in soy sauce/ vinegar concoction that i had perfected to my palate
3. Place dumpling on my spoon, and ginger on top of the dumpling 
4. Devour it with the soup Exploding in your mouth (the best way to enjoy it in my world)

As i was chewing and eating and thinking about the dumpling that is being processed in my mouth, I had a hard to trying to taste the soup.  The skin of the dumplings were a bit thicker than what i am use to.  The meat itself was delicious hearty.  (and after walking for 30 mins trying to find the place, it was a slight reward on my physically activity workout)  
Unfortunately I didnt get to the look at the menu to see what else they have available but from my observation at other tables they all look great!  Cheap good food that fulfills your hunger pang!
 
Is it worth the trip? Well if you never had soup dumplings... then by all mean check it out!",1
"We were on a hunt for dim sum. Thought this was the place, but it wasnt. So we sat and decided to eat anyways. LIttle did we know, we hit the jackpot!!! we got soup dumplins, pan fried dumplings and a pancake. BEST soup dumplings EVER! The price made this yummy dumpling even better! 

This place is exactly what you think when you think chinatown. Everyone we dont know is sitting together around the same table. Its packed, so service may not be the best. The vibe was awesome and so was the food. Im definately going back nex time!",1
"This is probably the best shanghai bum restaurant in town. I was here with a friend, and we really enjoy the food here. Pretty much most of the food is tasteful, and I will be back!",1
"I recommend Joe's Shanghai all the time for their soup dumplings. so delicious!

The dining setting is fast paced and you may sit with strangers. But if you're ok with this, then Joe's Shanghai is for you!",1
Xiao long bao (soup dumpling) is very awesome. I'm just a tourist but i been there 2 days in a roll.,1
"Joes Shanghai is an NYC experience. Usually a wait if 20 ish minutes but it moves fast. You sit at communal tables and the service is not personalIzed and is very rushed. But don't get it twisted, just how it is in china town. Pork steamed dumplings, scallion pancakes and string beans are the go to.",1
"My first dine in experience after COVID. 
Joe's shanghai is my favorite weekend location since college:)) 

beef in spicy chill sauce: i think they changed formula. it has strong vinegar flavor now. a bit disappointed but still okay. 

Soup dumpling: AMAZING",1
"We love Joe's Shanghai! We used to go to the Flushing location until it closed and this location is just as good! The ingredients are always fresh, from the broccoli to green peppers, and the ingredients great quality, beef, shrimp, and scallops. The sauces are always perfectly flavorful and seasoned.

One of my favorite dishes is the scallops and prawns in garlic sauce, the sauce is so very good. 

It looks popular to eat indoors too (no outdoor seating) but we have only ever done takeout from this location. Takeout has always been pretty fast and well organized.",1
"This place is a must for newcomers and NYC veterans alike.  You can obviously tell from the reviews that the soup dumplings are their specialty.  They come with crab and pork or only pork filling.  The dumplings are pretty good sized, and the dough is perfect so that you don't prematurely rupture the dumpling itself.  I also tried some pan-fried combination meat noodle dish, which was pretty good, but I forget exactly what it was called because I was so distracted by the amazing soup dumplings!

This place is cash only, and during peak dining hours you'll probably have to wait.  The good thing is that the staff moves quickly and with a purpose.  Also, to minimize wait times, they seat multiple parties together at those larger round tables to ensure there are no empty seats in the restaurant at a given time.  My party was quoted a 20 minute wait at 3pm on a Saturday, but we were seated in 5 minutes.",1
Its cash only and there is usually a line but worth the wait. The best soup dumplings in town!!,1
"i'm a fan of their soup dumplings, quick service and moderate prices.  the dining area is frugal.  don't expect fine dining.  its cash only and they include gratuity on the check.",1
"Best xiao long bao I have ever had. 

I've also had their stirfry green beans with beef and that was also a good dish! So is the cold peanut noodles that they recommended. ( I feel bad because my friend ate this when she's allergic to peanuts.) oh and my other friend got a bad stomach ache. It's a good thing nothing happened to me otherwise it would've been a 4 stars instead of a 5.",1
"I love me some Xiao Long Bao (XLB)! Was so excited to try this, it was the first thing I ate when I landed in New York. 

Got the pork xlb, pork and crab xlb, and scallion pancake. They were all delicious! They're much larger than normal but in my opinion, the more the better. I also love how there is a lot of soup in the dumplings. The worst is when they're dry! 

Just FYI, on the menu, they don't call it juicy dumplings or xiao long bao. That confused me at first because I didn't want to end up with regular dumplings. They just call them as dumplings instead under the appetizer section. 

Usually there is a really long wait but I didn't have to wait at all. I went around 12pm on a Thursday.  They also make you share a table with other people so that could make some people uncomfortable. The walls also have photos of all the celebrities who have been there. It's a must go spot!",1
"Are you looking for some tasty Eastern Chinese food at a good price in New York's Chinatown? Are you willing to wait a little while to eat at this place? Are you also willing to deal with service that's not great? Well, if you said yes, this place has your answer. The 2010 Not For Tourists Guide to New York City had said that the crab soup dumplings ""are essential Chinatown eats"" (page 27) and this place is one of the most talked about restaurants in New York's Chinatown. After waiting for 25 minutes, my friend and I were able to get a seat at this place. 

When my friend and I sat down, we quickly ordered the #1, Xie Fen Xiao Long Bao, which is the Crab Meat with Pork Meat Steamed Bun. This is the crab soup dumplings that the guide was talking about. 

One basket filled with Xie Fen Xiao Long Bao is enough for a light appetizer for 2-4 people and there are 8 pieces. I actually enjoyed the flavor of the bun, and the meat inside. I don't think I tasted much crab meat. I was able to enjoy the buns by taking a small bite, and sucking the warm broth inside the bun. The dark soy vinegar sauce made the Xiao Long Bao tastier and I liked the warm and soft chewiness of the bun. I have eaten Xiao Long Bao in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the somewhat decent city of Boston, and this place in New York's Chinatown does a pretty good job in making Xiao Long Bao. 

As for other dishes, my friend got #139, which is the Pan Fried Noodles. He liked them, but I was not impressed. The noodles were bland and it was doused with a lot of sauce. I would not recommend ordering this dish if you really want a great Chinese dinner. The portion was generous, though. 

However, they do a good job with this noodle dish, and I would highly recommend this one. I got the #143, Ge Shi Chao Nian Gao, which is the Fried Rice Cake with pork. This is a rice noodle dish where the noodles are shaped like small and flat oval tablets, which look like cakes. It has some strips with pork, fried in a wok with spinach. I thought it was a tasty dish, with tender pork and soft and somewhat crisp fried rice noodles. This is a great choice to complement the Xiao Long Bao, and one dish is enough to feed a very hungry man for dinner. 

The service was not great, but somewhat effective. You may have to yell a little loud and clear if you know what to order. and the servers are not really friendly. A 15% service charge is added to your bill. This is probably the first restaurant I have been to in the USA that actually charges a service charge no matter how large the group is. 

Since this place is really popular, and you have a group less than six, you may have to share a large table with people you don't know. This may not be a bad thing. 

Overall, if you really want some Xiao Long Bao, this is a great choice as long as you are willing to wait for a table and you are willing to deal with not great service. I would not say that it is a place that you really have to go to according to the guides, but it is a great choice for some Xiao Long Bao and some Shanghai-style Fried Rice Cakes. Is this the best place for Xiao Long Bao in New York's Chinatown? Possibly. Is the Xiao Long Bao on par with Shanghai's or Hong Kong's Xiao Long Bao? Probably not, but this place is pretty good and worthwhile to go.",1
Loved it!  A hole in the wall place in Chinatown with delicious dumplings for cheap.  Loved the pork dumplings!  The table sharing was a first for me but a couple of people at the table were very friendly and added to our experience.  The servers were swift but not too friendly but we got our food very fast so we were happy.,1
"My friend and I get dinner once a month. This month was my friend's turn to pick. He had bookmarked Joe's Shanghai a while ago and we finally got around to trying it. We got there early enough on a Thursday (around 6:45) that we were able to be seated right away. (When we left there was a wait) It's a large restaurant with high ceilings and some modern decor. It is however very bright and somewhat loud.

Our waiter was nice and the service was fast and furious (we got the impression that they knew how to turn tables). They landed the appetizers in rapid succession. The soup dumplings (pork and pork with crab) were quite good, certainly on the substantial side. Not the top I've had but certainly in the top 3-5. The turnip cakes were tasty, nice texture. I wasn't blown away by the cold noodles with peanut sauce, serviceable but a little off texturally and underwhelming seasoning. The cold chicken in wine was tasty, it was good with the chili oil that's on the table. We moved on to the lion's head meatballs and then the beef with flat noodles. You get four large meatballs and they were tasty. Not the best example of this dish that I've had but passable. The waiter recommended the beef with flat noodles. In his defense, he may have thought we were into basic dishes. It lacked pop, the noodle texture was alright, not an overwhelmingly good dish.

I gave it four stars because we didn't eat anything that wasn't at least tasty. That said, nothing blew us away. Felt a bit geared towards a touristy Chinatown experience. Also, cash only.",1
"There is no denial the steamed pork soup dumpling are SO GOOD!! And for the price $7 for 8 dumplings!! You can't really beat that and that is the reason why I keep coming back!
However I need to precise that the service here is pretty bad.. they are rude and try to rush you through your meal (if they could feed you to make you eat faster they would).
So go there for the pork soup dumpling (the crab one are not as good) but don't expect to have a calm or romantic dinner.",1
"A group of 7 of us stop by Joe's Shanghai for a quick bite (with a place like this in the city, is it ever quick??) and as expected, Joe's Shanghai delivered some pretty delicious bites.

Let's start with the xiao long baos (steamed soup dumplings) - While these were still good, they're not the best that I've had (even counting previous times at Joe's Shanghai). The biggest thing for me was that the dumplings came out really flat. I'd say the skin might have been just a tad too thin and they probably could have used a little bit more meat in it. But either way, it still tasted like heaven.

The beef noodle soup was the biggest disappointment for me. While the flavor of the broth and the texture of the beef was spot on, the noodles were a little bit overcooked for me (I find overcooked pasta/noodles are prone to high volume places like these). 

For what it's worth - the wait this time wasn't as bad as they said it would be. From initially being quoted an hour wait, we ended waiting maybe 15 minutes.",1
"My favorite - Xiao Long Bao place! If you want fabulous soup dumplings this is definitely the place to go.
Yes the wait is long. Yes it may feel a little weird to be seated at a round table next to total strangers. But it's all worth it after you have a bite of their pork & crab soup dumplings.

I agree with the other reviewer wherein, you go here for the XLB's not for their main dishes. The main entree's weren't bad at all, I'm just saying that I wouldn't go here if I didn't want to order XLBs.

Service is what I would expect in any other Asian restaurant wherein they really just try to get their job done in a rush. But I'm used to it.

Note: Pricing is also affordable. Their XLB order comes with 8 dumplings. Cash only!

I highly recommend this place. (And Quickly's next door!)",1
Delicious every time we go. Xiao long bao one of the best I've ever had. Also just tried the scallion cake and had to order another because it was so yummy.,1
"This place is the ultimate NYC tourist trap because it is very well known for their soup dumplings (I can see why). Their soup dumplings are delicious and addictive. They are perfect to eat on a cold winter day or night. The only downside about this restaurant is that chances are you will have to be seated with strangers in their large round tables (so they won't waste any seat space as hundreds of people wait long periods of time to get a table everyday). I was awkwardly seated so closely with strangers in the same table and when our different orders arrived at our table (note: mostly everyone who comes here orders soup dumplings), it would be kind of difficult to sort our orders out.",1
"My wife and I had dinner at the new Joe's Shanghai on Bowery, just around the corner from the old place. Everything about the new restaurant is wonderful--the service, food quantity, price, and the nicely decorated space.  We ordered veggie dumplings, crispy Hunan beef, and shrimp and scallops in garlic sauce and enjoyed every dish. We would definitely recommend this place if you are in Chinatown.",1
4 stars for the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. By far the best I've had in the city with a nice chili oil. Love the  depth of the broth in the dumplings. Thick skin so they do not easily break. The pork is soft and melts in your mouth. Always quick and fast service. This place is usually packed at lunch time. A definite must try. Remember it is cash only and service/gratuity is already included on the bill.,1
"Was in NY for work and my co-workers wanted to eat in Chinatown so we decided to try Joe's Shanghai. Honestly I came in with no expectations, because being from LA I've been spoiled with good authentic Chinese food. I knew coming in it wouldn't be authentic and the food would cater to tourists. But the food was actually pretty good! 

We had 4 people in our group and we had to share a large table with 2 other parties. The restaurant was jam packed and service was not friendly. We ordered a bunch of dishes and shared. We all agreed that the soup dumplings was the highlight! We still talk about the dumplings til this day LOL I wish we got another order. Some other dishes I enjoyed were the Shanghai noodles, scallion beef and general tso shrimp. My coworkers liked the scallion pancake but I thought it was too thick. 

Overall I would return for the noodles and dumplings. Be sure to come early because when we left, the crowd outside got bigger!",1
"I've been meaning to come here to try the XLB. It's not bad!! But it's not your Din Tai Fung, if that makes sense.

We were only a party of 2, so we got seated asap. Everyone comes in parties of 4+ and it's packed with tourists down Pell St. 

We got squished into a shared table with others and ordered the crab xlb. I was pleased to see that these were pretty good sized - not the skimpy, overpriced ones. They were pretty good! 

My only complaint is the juice almost always spilled when picking it up. They don't give you any bowls either. So you're just trying to balance and catch everything in a normal-sized spoon. The meat was also pretty chewy, made me think it was undercooked.. but don't believe that's the case. 

Probably a one-time thing for me. There are plenty of other xlb places in the city to try. But definitely give this place a shot if you haven't been before!",1
"For starters: Service isn't great here. Not that I was expecting much, but often it's hard to get seated, they forget to bring you the menu, etc.

However, the food here is incredibly delicious. From the soup dumplings to the fried rice, I highly recommend.",1
This place is quite good. We got the dumplings and the service was pretty good. Super fast and nice wait time. We really only ordered dumplings and noodles. But it's kinda pricey for what u get. But the dumplings were huge but epic soup dumpling. Honestly when I come to New York again I prolly won't go here just to try the other options.,1
"I first came here with my brother-in-law and oh, 6 of his male cousins and had no idea what to expect. The soup dumplings should probably be named ""crack"" dumplings because I crave them on a weekly basis. I have to say that the one thing I love most about living in NYC is having access to amazing Asian food and Joe's is #1 on my list. All the dishes (well, the authentic Chinese ones) are made just like they would be at home. I could do without the wait (since I always show up starving), but it's generally a good sign (i.e. that the food is THAT good). It's weird to be seated right next to someone that you don't know while having dinner, but the food's so good, you won't even notice. You must go here.",1
"The soup dumplings are AMAZING. Shanghai noodles are also good, and the cabbage with black mushroom. I've never had a dish here I didn't like. The midtown location is prettier, of course, but Pell Street is the way to go. In midtown you get six dumplings per basket; in Chinatown you get eight, and they seem fresher. Plan to wait in line outside the restaurant, and plan to be seated at a large table with other parties.",1
The dumplings are amazing! I've been here a few times and have loved everything they have. You don't always get a personal table so be ready to potentially sit around a table with random people.,1
"The best soup dumplings I've ever had!!! We also ordered fried dumplings/potstickers, crispy seafood noodles, fried rice, general tso chicken. Everything was delicious. Even the hot chili sauce they keep on the tables. Make sure to bring cash, it's cash only.",1
It's a hidden gem in Chinatown! Whoever likes Shanghai food should come here and have a bite. Very authentic flavor! Based on my 4 years living experiences in Shanghai.,1
"Joe's Shanghai absolutely lives up to the hype. Yup, the crab & pork xlb are on everyone's table and are absolutely the best. The spring rolls and scallion pancakes were super flaky and crispy as well -- everything tasted super fresh and not overly greasy at all! We did have to wait around 40 minutes though to get sat and everyone waits outside in the hot nyc sun but it was very well worth it. Oh and the service was just fine. Straight forward service and food came out in a timely manner for how busy the place was! This isn't fine dining yall!",1
Best Chinese in NY I go here every time I come to NYC. Make sure you get the dumplings when you come. Also the line is long so be patience did I spell that right? Very reasonably priced and service is fast once you finally sit down. They also sit you with other people which was fine with me. They get your order in if you are ready and bring your food out when it is done.,1
"I hate this place. It ruined soup dumplings for me. It's never been the same. The texture, the flavor, the filling, even the price. Best soup dumplings I've ever had.",1
"I'm not from New York, but if a friend who doesn't even live in New york recommends Joe's shanghai, this guy Joe must make some really good stuff! Of course we ordered the Pork Xia Long Bao (soup dumplings) 8 for only $5, what a steal! Our friend told us theres no point in ordering the mixed crab/pork one since theres barely any crab and they charge an extra ~$2, smart thinking! I also got to try the shanghai fried rice, which was pretty good! The place is very small, approx. 12 tables? The service is just like any other asian place, awful! At first, I thought the service was okay, but as time went by I realized the workers standing over our table and handing us the bill and literally standing there until we paid! I don't blame them since the place is small and people are always waiting for tables, but gosh don't be that rude! Don't be surprised, the bill has tax & tip included. We had a table of 7 people and we each paid under $10 each. I definitely recommend this place. You know where you can find me on my next nyc trip ;)

"This is a pre-covid review. I always like to mention this because the menu could have changed. 

I ate here with a few friends when we were in town. It was on top of our list because of the raving reviews about this place. The reviews did not disappoint. They have those stars for a reason. My review would just be full of ""delicious"" and ""tasty"" so let's just cut to the chase. Everything I list below was !

"Delicious soup dumplings and affordable food. This place is always packed and it's better to go for 3 ppl and under. You have to share tables with strangers and it's loud in there. My husband and I just go in, get the crab dumplings, jellyfish and shrimp fried rice and leave right after we finish eating. They serve the food rather quickly. Not a fan of their fried noodles.",1
Grew up eating this place when it was on Pell. All the dishes are great and crab meat soup dumplings a must.,1
"You're guaranteed to wait because this place is always packed. My sister insists it's the best place to eat in Chinatown. 

This place is known for their dumplings, but sadly none of them were vegetarian so I had to just sit and watch wistfully and my sister and her boyfriend devoured two orders of them. 

I was able to enjoy a tofu and mixed vegetable plate that was delicious and the shallot pancakes came with a sweet dipping sauce and were definitely my favorite part of the meal. The bean curd and spinach dish that I ordered was greasy and weird and I wouldn't recommend it. 

Service is pretty good and they work to get people and food in and out as fast as possible.",1
"After reading the review on yelp a few months ago, my friend decided to take us to Joe's Shanghai. Tucked away in a little nook of Chinatown, this unassuming restaurant was well worth the trip from Queens; and from what I've experienced, it deserves the high yelpers rating. 
 Make sure to bring cash with you, as they don't except plastic; also be prepared to wait a good amount of time... As this place is almost always busy (but well worth it!). As stated in previous reviews, the dumplings are a MUST, as they are probably the best tasting dumplings I have ever had; the delicious meat/porky broth on the inside is what makes Joe's dumplings famous. Just be careful, as the broth is steaming hot. Learning how to eat them is also fun. Some people poke holes into the dumpling and slowly slurp up the juice; I tried this method, and it works for the most part. Just don't pop them whole into your mouth, unless you want to look like a fool.
 Besides the dumplings, Joe's Shanghai also delivers the goods in it's entrees. I've had the duck on many occasions, and it's always savory and delicious. Just be careful when ordering entrees, as the portions are fairly big. 
 As with other jam packed Chinese restaurants, Joe's Shanghai uses a table sharing method. Whether or not this is a good thing is for the individual to decide; I prefer the more conventional style, being able to share an explicit and often scandalous conversation with my friends without worrying about eavesdropping yuppies, but I do admit that this system seems to fit in with the cute, unassuming, unpretentious picture Joe's Shanghai has painted itself. And it's sometimes funny to hear other peoples conversations; but then again it's not so great to get into an argument with a disillusioned, overtly rude, 30 something year old new yorker about how much to tip the waiter. I know that his jealousy of my youth and beauty must have been great, but please try to leave the waiters tip out of it.
 All that aside, Joe's Shanghai is well worth the wait, and a delightfully fun experience.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is a classic must visit every time I'm craving some authentic and delicious Chinese food. The first time I visited, the place was still in the older location and looked a bit more like a mom and pop shop than what it is now. The new remodeled location looks great. It's very clean and almost doubled in seating. 

We arrived on the weekend for a late lunch and the wait was still around a 40 minute wait. Once we were seated the turnaround time was super quick. The way to go is family style, so you can try a bunch of different things on the menu. 

We kind of over ordered for a party of three but here's what we ordered: 

Cold noodles - i would not get this again. It tasted like noodles with peanut butter and nothing else. There were about 3 cucumber slices and it did not live up to the traditional cold noodles I remember having as a kid. 

XLB - we ordered 3 baskets, which was way too much food haha. Their soup dumplings are HUGE. They're almost twice the size of what I remember them to be. Delicious, the skin is super thin and the soup is SO flavorful. Loved every bite. Make sure you eat this warm so the soup doesn't solidify. 

Sichuan beef - hands down the best dish second to the XLB. The meat was tender and flavorful. The bean sprouts were the perfect compliment. 

Eggplant - This dish was ok, not as saucy as we remember but still a delicious dish. 

If you're in the area, you must stop by and try Joe's! But FYI it's cash only!",1
I have an asian tongue and I have to say that I love this place especially the dumplings!! The soup inside is nothing to say more than great!!!,1
"XLB's, ftw!!!

I love soup dumplings; they're absolutely delicious & filling. Although I'm originally from LA (tons of great Chinese restaurants), the first time I had xiao long bao was when I moved out to NYC at Shanghai Cafe.

Shanghai Cafe's XLB's are okay, but I actually prefer the broth of Joe's XLB's much much much more. There's something about the richness of the broth at Joe's Shanghai that I was very impressed with.. it didn't taste watered-down like the ones at Shanghai Cafe, to explain it in the most simple terms, I guess. I've had XLB's three times at Shanghai Cafe, and all three times, I thought the broth there was a bit watered down/tasteless.

Joe's Shanghai staff is much nicer and they don't push you to eat fast, pay the bill, and leave quickly, ha.

My friend & I shared a table with complete strangers, but that's nothing new at Chinese restaurants. We sat by the wall that had Jeremy Lin's photo with a waiter, so that was cool. The prices are decent, the staff is nice, and most importantly, I really enjoyed my XLB's.",1
So freaking good. Try to get here before the rush. Small parties of two are your best bet here since they put different people at a 10 person table. The turn around here is quick. The waiter asks you right when they seat you if you want the XLB. Just say yes because you do. I really like the pork dumplings. The skin stuck to my lips a bit but the soup was sooooooo yummy two orders of XLB and scallion pancakes and you're full for a pretty good price. Totally a must go here.,1
"This place is great! I love the food, service, and location. The wait time can be crazy sometimes because of it's worth it. The food is family style so whatever you order make sure you share because it's too much for one person. To kill some time while you wait for a table, get a foot massage across the street, it is so worth it.",1
"We waited about 2 hours standing outside for our party of 3 to be called on. Usually, I would be irate over the insane wait. However, we went during a very busy time of the year AND the food was to die for. Be prepared to be crammed in and share a table with other people. The soup dumplings were amazing--thin, sticky dough filled with a delicious broth and a melt-in-your-mouth pork filling. I've never tasted anything like it! The Spring Rolls were also the best I've ever had. They need a larger location, but I would definitely go matter no matter what.",1
"Excellent XLB.
Being from LA we go to DTF enough to compare. 
These are bigger, juicier, and less expensive. 
The skin is slightly thicker, but needs to be in order to hold the soup inside. These are like if you have an expert grandma making them for you.
Scallion pancakes were also outstanding. Crispy outside, soft inside, with nice scallion flavor.",1
"Excellent and authentic Chinese restaurant! I have eaten here many times, sometimes with friends, during my many stays in NYC, and, just as is true with their sister shop called Joe's Ginger which is located nearby, the food is great! 

Intrestingly, I consistently notice that a great many of this restaurant's customers are local Chinese residents and also visitors from China, all of whom regularly insist that the food is very authentic and ""real"". 

They also do not overdo the MSG, which I really appreciate, since I am MSG-sensitive, and rather, they tend to be very conservative in their use of MSG.

The manu has some great and rather unique offerings, with many offerings remaining very true to the authentic Shanghai cuisine.

One word of warning: this restaurant tends to get very crowded, very fast, once 5 PM approaches each day!

I have always had great meals at this restaurant, with no exceptions!",1
"Going to join in on the hype and say that the crab soup dumplings here are the best I've had in the states. The pungent flavor of crab intestines really comes through, whereas I've found at other places that it's hard to distinguish the crab from the pork soup dumplings. In my experience, this location does a much more consistent job of providing fresh batches of dumplings versus the Midtown location. If you come at an off-peak time, the wait is very reasonable. We arrived around 5pm on a weekday, pre-dinner rush, and waited less than 10 minutes. Focus on the soup dumplings and order other dishes as sides, since everything else is pretty run-of-the-mill.",1
"absolutely excellent food. Went with a group and got the pork soup dumplings along with an order of pork Gyoza. These were the best soup dumplings I've ever had in my life! The only issue was that the line was very long, but it's because it's so popular everybody wanted to go.",1
"Delicious. Must pay with caah! Family style eating is best. Its community seating, but so yummy. Dumplings, kung pao and crispy beef all so tasty. This is my new hidden gem.  Loved it!!!",1
Great food  ambiance adds to your experience as you dine in Chinatown NYC.  Pork dumplings in soup are as delicious as you would expect them to be.  Service is quick as there is always people waiting to be seated.  Cash only with an ATM appropriately found right outside the entrance.  Ordered sesame chicken which was also quite delicious and it comes with a nice side of green broccoli .  And something that I loved was that end of meal orange slices placed in the table.  Sweet delicious fresh orange slices to help cleanse your after meal taste buds.  If you are visiting NYC I would recommend taking an Uber to get there as Chinatown can be confusing if you don't know it.,1
"A little know note.  I use to work in Flushing and ate in Joe's Shanghai, the 
ORIGINAL Joe's.  Chinatown is A BRANCH of Flushing...a real Different.
Yes, it borders on touristy but the Pork Dumplings are the best.  I like the
simplicity of it...no decisions get the dumplings, get a cold beer and warm
yourself up.  One of the reviewers said it had not been updated since 1943.
Since Joe's Flushing only opening in the early 90's I don't think so.  It
deals on quantity and forgets about ambiance..ok by me as long as dumplings
keep being delicious.  If I want ambiance I will have to pay for it.
I must get out of a rut and try the scallion pancakes.  Flushing has the the
same fishbowl but is quite a bit bigger and a little more formal...not much",1
"Never dissatisfied so warm as it goes down feels like love  I was like, is that Joe of Shanghai lol??? No one she visit China without stopping here first.....there are others but these are tha best! Go change someone's life and take them here!",1
"Soup dumplings were fabulous. Tried the chicken fried rice which was also good, but nothing can beat the dumplings.",1
"Come for the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes, stay for nothing else. 

One order per person, two if they're gluttons. I prefer the pork only, since the crab and pork are just ok and nothing too special.

And I'm serious about ordering nothing else except the xiao long bao and scallion pancakes.",1
"Came here on sat for dinner and wait was about 40 min, they give you a raffle ticket that's easy to lose so dont lose it !! 

There are a few chairs and benches outside to sit on. 
This restaurant has gotten so popular because of yelp and word of mouth etc, there are peiple from all parts of the world eating here. 

You have to split tables with people, if you don't have enough of a ful table, so we ended up at a table with 3 other groups which I hate because it's kind of awkward sometimes. 

We ordered xiao long bao, crab xiao long bao, dan dan mian, garlic eggplant, rice cake with beef, and shredded pork with jalapenos and bean curd. 

My favorite dishes were the dan dan mian, and the crab xiao long bao. The crab xiao long bao had amazing crab flavor and was so savory and delicious. The dan dan mian was super peanut butter which I love !!! The eggplant was way too sweet, so I only had one piece. The other dishes were not really my taste either because they were too sweet. 

Must get the crab xiao long bao!!",1
Food and service was great! It seems like locals even come here to eat as well as tourist!,1
"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Dumplings. Just AMAZING. We got there at the perfect time because the line was not to long but by the time we walked out, there was a huge line! We ordered 1 order of the pork dumping and one of the crab-pork dumpling. Both were great. But if I had to choose, I'd choose the pork. There were many other shops that served dumplings but I'm glad we chose this one.",1
"I've come here ever since I was a kid and whenever I get a chance to go, I would never say no! This is absolutely the most amazing place ever and I've never tried a soup dumpling place in NYC that is better than this, in my opinion at least. I've loved it since I was young and I'll continue to love it till this day. Joe's shanghai lives up to it's name and makes amazing soup dumplings.",1
"Let me start by saying, if you mind sharing a table with strangers, this is not the place for you. Joe's only has 10 person round tables, which they fill up, so unless you are a party of 10, you're sharing a table. But if that doesn't bother you, then by all means, if you are in Chinatown, you have to come to Joe's. And yes, the soup dumplings are famous for a reason. I am glad the the other people at our table got theirs before us, because there's a technique to eating them. I don't know how many they make a day, but the nine people at our table had 48. 

We also had the Shanghai fried rice and the crispy whole fish. The rice was good, not greasy like the kind you get at  many take-out  places. Simple, with egg and scallions. The crispy fish was cooked well. The menu says it's spicy, but it wasn't at all. I don't know if they made it less spicy for us because I asked how spicy it is. He said medium, but it wasn't . 

So a pot of tea, 8 dumplings, a platter of rice and a whole fish for $41 pre tip. Not bad. Oh, by the way, it's cash only. 

My daughter said the next time we're in New York we have to go back to Joe's. And, oh yes, we definitely will.",1
"I was watching the Karate Kid one night and was like wow I want Chinese food. Best decision ever. Went down to Pell St and got some love from my main man Joey Shanghai. They have the best shrimp in the state most likely from the Hudson River and their chopsticks are very easy to use they always have a custom pair with rubberbands they give to their most experienced customers. Xièxiè, Joe, Xièxiè (yes that is authentic Chinese LeAndre is a very cultured, classy man from a classy family in the hills).",1
"came here with some friends on a day trip.  the xiao long bao were so good that we ordered four plates of them, two of the regular and two of the crab ones.  the crab ones were soooooo good!  
don't remember the specifics about the other dishes we ordered but everything was so delicious that it didn't even matter!  the prices were decent and the wait was at a minimum.  reason for short wait: coming here on a weekday afternoon!",1
"Really great place to eat! I would recommend them for their soup dumplings! The broth was delicious and rich. The service professional and friendly, not too long waiting for food.",1
"As my friends and I arrived at a hole-in-the-wall in a sketchy-looking area at night, I thought to myself, the food better be good if I'm gonna risk getting mugged and it was worth it.

Food:
I was told that they had great soup dumplings called Xiao Long Bao (shanghai style steamed pork buns).  When they mentioned soup dumplings, I thought it was a bunch of dumplings in a soup. When the food was dropped off, I realized that the soup was inside each dumpling! It was my first time having these and I was blown away. The meat was delicious and the soup provided even more flavor. Top each bite with ginger and soy sauce and it'll be an excellent meal

Service:
Mediocre. They just take orders and drop them off. They don't really check on you to see how you're doing and it takes forever to get a refill of water.",1
"I think that Joe's Shanghai's xiao long bao are likely to be the best in the city and probably the best on the east coast (I've even heard best in America but let's not get ahead of ourselves).  The soup dumplings truly are delicious and flavorful, though compared to the real deal of Shanghai, they still need work in the aesthetics area.  Don't waste your money on the crab flavored soup dumplings since they suck and don't taste better than the regular pork ones.  Also, the other food is pretty unspectacular.  I like to eat soup dumplings here as a pre-meal appetizer or a snack.",1
"Bueno bonito y barato! Absolutely the best soup dumplings eva! Community tables, crowded even at 3pm but wait time was 15 mins. Definitely coming back and next tine ordering more!!",1
"Warning, this is a cash only place. The food was exceptional. The beef tendon noodle soup and crab dumplings were super good. I especially like the carp belly with buffalo sauce.",1
"CASH ONLY

I'm prepared to get some opposition on this, but let me just go ahead and say that this place is over-hyped. 
Don't get me wrong, their xiao long bao are delicious, but I wouldn't go far as to say that they're sublime. It's definitely more of a tourist attraction to eat here-- you can definitely find better XLB elsewhere in one of the other many restaurant in Chinatown. Though I must say, their crab XLB is one of the most delicious I've had. However, their pork XLB is nothing too special. And because this place generates so much foot traffic, you may end up sitting communal style at a round table with strangers. Service is at times frantic since there are so many customers. And just because you're all sitting together it doesn't mean you order at the same time so at times there can be confusion/mix-ups in the orders and it can be somewhat overwhelming. 
Overall, their XLB has a great balance of flavor, texture, and broth-to-meat ratio. As for their other dishes, I wouldn't know. I come strictly for the soup dumps. Prices are cheap and the place is just eat and go. 
There is almost always a long line, so if you can avoid it, do so.",1
"Must have - the steamed dumplings. Two kinds. Both great!
I go to this place one in a while for their cheap and delicious food. The location is kinda hard to find but it does not stop people from all over the world to come.
Usually you have to share a big round table with other people (there's way too many people..). Sometimes you can make friends while eating there.
Obviously it's not a place for a romantic dinner, but it's so much fun.",1
"Joe's Shanghai has got a new regular! 

Came here for the first time the other night and shared soup dumplings and scallion pancakes with the boyfriend and I kind of wish I came alone so that I can pig out with out feeling bad lol! We shared pork soup dumplings and crab soup dumplings and both found the crab to be our favorite. These soup dumplings are delicious and they are definitely not cheap on the soup! Very juicy (i even dirtied my cardigan from splash back!) and delicious flavor. This is my first time eating soup dumplings so you can take this review with a grain of salt, but my boyfriend is Chinese and said these were amazing so this gives me more validation lol!! Now this is not my first time having scallion pancakes and these have to be the best scallion pancakes i've ever had. Can't wait to go back!!!! 

Like the other reviewers have mentioned, you will be seated with other parties which can be kind of akward but once you get your food you seem to care a lot less about the others around you. The wait can be long it seems if you have a large party, since it was just me and my boyfriend we waited around 20minutes (in the harsh January cold tho). The biggest reason I deducted a point, was not for the wait because I don't mind waiting for good food but because our waiter and buss boy who took care of our table were very rude and brutal. They practically threw are food on the table and almost knocked down my tea on more than one occasion. Seriously lucky that I enjoy food so much I can look past this rude behavior. Also, before we even asked for the check our waiter brings us the check. Yes its great we didn't have to wait for it since we were ready to go, but how does he know that!?! Please ask first, i know its extremely busy but i don't think its right to basically kickout customers. 

So all in all, don't come here expecting amazing service but do expect to eat some delicious food.",1
"When you are in Chinatown, this is a must try place at least once in your lifetime. I stopped in on Thursday right when they opened at 11am. It was the best decision I made in NYC to have not wait time and getting to be seated immediately. 

Once we sat down, it didn't take that long for more customers to trickle in. Our server was decent but you don't go into Joes for the service. We only came in for the soup dumplings and ordered one of each (Pork and Crab & Pork). It took about 20 mins for the dumplings to come out, but once they did it was delicious. 

Each soup dumpling order comes in an order of 8 in a steamer basket. Each dumpling has actual soup to sip out and has a equal ratio of dumpling skin and meat. It's hard to find a good Chinese restaurant that will make this properly. 

The only gripe I had was regarding the dumpling placements. It was difficult to grab some of the dumplings that were touching each other because we didn't want to pop or rip the skin. 

Overall, I wanna go to Joes every time I am in town!",1
"The food was here was good with it being in China Town. There were a lot of options to get from the menu so I would advise looking at the menu online before coming. Also take a look at photos for added measure. 

The service was not so good. We felt rushed the entire time. The wait staff does not check to see if you need anything after they dump your order at the table. They also do not have ice for water or sodas on a hot day in July. Overall I would come back because I liked the food, but I would lower my expectations for service with a smile here. It's a shame that smiling when serving has left the planet.",1
"Got here on a bustling Saturday afternoon and was told that the wait would be 20 minutes.  With all the people packed outside the restaurant, I thought that was ridiculous and that there was no way we'd be in within 20.

Low and Behold, 20 minutes later, we are ordering the famous, hyped dumplings.

The dumplings were AMAZING.  The kind of amazing that makes your eyes do somersaults when you close them and you slurp up the savory salty soupy goodness that can only be found here.  The pork dumplings were RICH.  I don't even wanna know how much fat I'm potentially consuming but it was worth it.

Aw Man, I wanna give this place 5 stars but I can't because the service wasn't the greatest.  They worked fast, but the younger servers who were assigned our table kept slacking off and gave us weird looks whenever we ordered more food.  Also, not a fan of sharing tables, but suppose it's part of the experience.",1
"The food and the ambiance are delicious, if you're lucky to get a seat. The duck was simply outstanding.",1
"The hype makes for a long wait, but the pork soup dumplings are worth it. And trust me, one time I got minor food poisoning from their crab-pork soup dumplings and I still go back for the pork soup dumplings. The sesame chicken (yes lame order I know) was too sweet and syrupy for me but the garlic broccoli is delicious and underrated.",1
"The dumplings are little dumplings of soupy happiness. This is a great place. They are fast, efficient and would definitely seat you with a random family.. so be prepared to make friends. We also got some side orders of a pan fried red bean dessert - I do not recommend. We waited for a long time outside, so long.. we had to be creative with games. Anyway, just be prepared to make friends with your own friends.",1
"Great Shanghainese food, especially their xiao long bao, little meat filled dumplings filled with some of the tastiest dumpling soup! There's also lots of other shanghainese dishes, many prepared authentically... i used to live in shanghai soam quite an expert!


 Anyways, this place would have gotten five stars from me, except for the very cold and hurried waiting staff. Our table was full galfway through dinner and another dish arrived. Instead of trying to move plates around or come back later with the dish, rhe waiter just proceeded to plop it on top of two other dishes, toppling the vinegar dipping bowl in the process!

"99.9% of Chinese food in Manhattan is garbage. Joe's on Pell St is that .1%. I am a white dude who grew up in Long Island but I know my Chinese food

If you want polite waiters, a clean restaurant and no wait, this place isn't for you. But, if you want some bomb ass Chinese food this is the place to go.

Everything is good. Everything. Get the soup dumplings but don't hesitate to get your normal Chinese food favorites. Also get the steamed mini buns with condensed milk for something amazing (it's not on the menu).

Haters like to say, ""this isn't authentic Chinese food, it's American Chinese food"". Who cares??? Go to Beijing if you want something authentic and tastes like the food came from an animal shelter.

The waiters are rude but I find it fun to be just as rude to them. I think they appreciate it.",1
"Four stars for dumplings and no line! Go on a rainy day :) However, the rest of the foods are mediocre. I probably won't comeback again, unless I'm craving for crab and pork dumplings.",1
"I went on a Monday and there was no wait.  The soup dumplings are  delicious and filling but the group seating with strangers is awkward.

I went again on a Saturday with a large group and the wait was extremely long, but not impossible.  With 9 people they still sat strangers with us though!  The food is worth it.",1
"Amazing soup dumplings! When I first came here, I didn't realize what they were (my Canto friend ordered), so I took a big bite and carelessly sprayed scorching broth everywhere. After that lesson was learned, I was able to enjoy these dumplings with a lot more caution. The best way I found to eat them is to take a teeny bite out of the skin, dump the broth into the spoon they give you, sip the broth, and eat the rest of the dumpling. Like many restaurants in Chinatown, they give you free tea too!",1
"Beyond delicious. Amongst my favorite if not my favorite place in town.

Must have:
Crab xiao long bao
Shanghai rice
Shanghai noodles

Also pretty good the fried duck although extremely greasy.",1
"Great restaurant, quick service and came close to opening on a weekday so there wasn't a line or wait. Only got the soup dumplings and were so filling and delicious. The broth was flavorful and portions were big. Left happy and full and would come back next time I'm in NYC.",1
"The PORK xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are awesome. I wouldn't compare them to the ones in china or taiwan... but they're definitely the best around here. =) Dont' forget to eat the napa that's cooked with the xiao long bao. They're actually not bad!

Question of the day was... how do they keep the soup inside??? Someone said they inject it and another said they put the soup in there frozen. Any takers? HAHA. 

Things we ordered:
- Pork Xiao Long Bao. BEST choice. Best to order a couple of rounds ahead of time since it takes a little while to make. 
- Crab Xiao Long Bao. It's OK. Pork is better. But good to give it a try.
- Cold Braised Sliced Beef - Not bad here. 
- Cold Jelly Fish - Just okay as well. 


For next time: I'd just go for the pork xiao long bao.",1
"Great to come with a group when in Chinatown. They do communal seating, so you can buy a few dishes to share with your group. The soup dumplings are my favorite part. They get people in and out of there fast, so there typically isn't a very long wait.",1
"Favorite soup dumplings hands down. I've tried a lot ""hype"" soup dumpling places and this beats them all. I don't even like soup dumplings that much and I love this place. I always get the pork and crab dumplings. The place is usually packed so to get in and out, it's best to know your order beforehand. The scallion pancake is also very good.",1
"Wow, everything was delicious! Highly recommend the soup dumplings and, well, everything!",1
"Man, this place was gooooooood. Soup dumplings on point. This place was packed but totally worth the wait. Tried both the pork and crab xiao long bao as well as trying a few noodle dishes. So good!",1
"One of my greatest weaknesses: dumplings. Specifically, soup dumplings. I had my first soup dumpling in Los Angeles at Din Tai Fung, an equally famous establishment on the West coast. Ever since then, I have not been able to shake my craving for the little balls of dough and broth! Will C. and I decided to check out Joe's Shanghai around 2:30pm, thinking that the wait wouldn't be too bad. We were so, so, so wrong. If you're thinking about dining at Joe's Shanghai, just be prepared to wait no matter what time of day it is. There are a couple of spots to grab some bubble tea nearby, which is a great way to keep your mouth/stomach occupied while you endure the painstakingly long wait.  

Once inside, you'll notice that about 90% of the seating is communal. You will be sitting next to strangers and it is quite cramped, but keep your eye on the prize. You're there for the soup dumplings! I couldn't help but lol when I opened the menu because it looks like they crudely circled the pork and crab soup dumplings in ballpoint pen to indicate the dish's popularity. The first thing a waiter will ask you the moment you sit down is if you want to start with some dumplings. Your answer should be yes and you should be making multiple orders of the stuff. Between the two of us, Will C. and I ordered three orders of soup dumplings (2 pork, 1 crab). Each order comes with 8 dumplings, so you do the math. Between the pork and the crab dumplings, I preferred the pork dumplings as they were richer and the soup was denser in flavor. That being said, after my fourth or fifth pork dumpling, I felt like the soup was a little too rich and greasy for my taste, but this does not take away from the fact that Joe's has some great dumplings that live up to the hype. 

Getting good service here is nearly impossible. Because the restaurant is so packed (when I say packed, I mean borderline crazy), you gotta be a little aggressive to catch the attention of a waiter. So yes, dining at Joe's Shanghai requires a lot of patience, but patience yields favorable results...which in this case comes in the form of a piping hot, adorably shaped dumpling.",1
"The food was delicious.  5 stars for that, but it was a little pricy, and the seating is pretty bad. We were at a round table that was cut a quarter of the way to fit more people, and even then my elbows were rubbing against my  girlfriend. If you're a party of two expect for the waiter to sit someone at your table half way through your meal. That was a little awkward but understandable . The dumplings are flavorful, taste fresh and plump.",1
Great place for a quick bite to eat. We were seated right away even though it's busy all of the time. We always get the crab soup dumplings. The location in queens definitely makes better dumplings though.,1
"After a long bus ride to NY, we were pretty hungry.  I was a little confused at first because when I read soup dumplings in other reviews I imagined a bowl of soup with dumplings in it.  Hah.  The reality was much better - soup INSIDE of the dumpling. Yumm.

Service was quick.  We walked in and were seated right away at a table with others.  The waiter asked us if we wanted the dumplings and we asked for the crab meat.  We also ordered the scallion pancake.  Total came to around $13 including tip.",1
"Ordered some crab with pork meat dumplings omgddd so delicious. When u take a bite the soup and all the flavor bursts into your mouth. I must say this is something new, but would definitely eat again. Second entree was fried porkchop also delicious. It was very crunchy. Young chow fried rice was great also. Overall this is my favorite Chinese food in nyc",1
"Pork dumplings over the crab dumplings. They are still both great and steaming hot. 

Din Tai Fung is still a contender but this place is authentic and you can't beat the prices. 

It would be nice to have more ginger, make sure to ask for more!",1
"Soup dumplings are always tasty!! I like the ones with crab a little bit more. Today we tried steamed Chilean seabass.... it was fantastic!! Really really good..... highly recommened! 
Sadly We got one dumpling with not properly cooked.... we asked the server but they said it s just flavor :/ (I mean we knew it s flavor but it's uncooked!).... so that s the reason for 4 not 5 stars this time.",1
"Ordered in-person take-out from Joe's and got the Shanghai Noodle Soup with Flat Noodles. This wasn't as good as the soup dumplings or stir fried noodles, but they were still decent (could have been more flavorful and less greasy). 

When I went, Joe's didn't have any sit-down dining options, though there were two tables outside the restaurant people could sit at. It's also cash only.",1
We had crab and pork meat soup dumpling ($7.95 per basket) and a fried pork chop with sweet plum sauce and a side of steamed rice ($12.95) Both dish were good and decent price. There was a 8.875% tax and 15% service charge for the bill. They take cash only too!!,1
"One of our stops during a dumpling tour with Sarah B. Seating for two was promptly given. There was a line out the door but I'm guessing they have larger parties. It's not my first time here but I like taking first timers to give it a try. The dumplings were tasty as usual. I still find it too thin and they often rip before making it to your taste buds. We tried a new dish since there's a one dish per person minimum. The pork fried rice cakes were delicious. It's my second favorite dish here now. 

Time to go back to Shanghai Cafe =]",1
"Believe the hype people!! It's one of the best authentic Chinese food I've had from Boston, California, Philadelphia and New York. We went a little before prime time and still had to wait about 30 minutes. Once seated- they'll fill up a round table with strangers- they take your order and food comes out in a reasonable amount of time. 

- Pork Xiao long bao: excellent, juicy and the skin is perfect. 
- Hot & Sour soup: good, traditional taste like other Chinese restaurants. Chunkier mushrooms. 
- Stir fry flat noodles: saucy, greasy and great flavor. 
- Yang Chow Fried rice: this was my absolute favorite! The flavor was delicious, one of the best I've had! 
- Crispy pork chop: good, had a slight curry flavor, I'm assuming for the nice golden color. 

They only accept CASH and 15% gratuity is already incorporated in the bill- although I left extra for the great service. We will definitely be back when in NYC.",1
"This was my first time having authentic Xiao Long Baos (soup dumplings), and it was an absolute delight.

I wholeheartedly suggest giving their soup dumplings a try, as they steal the spotlight at this restaurant.

Our table opted for both the pork and crab soup dumplings; while most of us favored the pork, I found both equally enjoyable. The crab soup dumpling packs a strong crab flavor punch, which might be a bit intense for some palates.

Service was just okay - the place was packed and chaotic. Definitely not the spot for a peaceful dinner!",1
"I have to admit, Joe's Shanghai was simply excellent. They are much cheaper than the competition. Every single menu item that we ordered was extra fresh and tasty. The staff was really helpful and service is very good. Yum!",1
"Fantastic soup dumplings, good prices, and crazy busy atmosphere. If you have time (usually long wait times), and are looking for a fun and tasty experience Joe's Shanghai is the place to be!",1
"So I've been to Joe's Shanghai at least 4 times now. I love their soup dumplings! I never had any when I was China, or I don't remember, so I can't really compare. But still, they're really good! I only like the pork and crab ones though. My boyfriend and I ordered both and we ate the one with crab first, and then the ones with only pork. The ones with only pork tasted good, but I kind of felt like it's missing something. So if you want to try both, eat the one with only pork first!
Other dishes are ok, but not too impressive. I tried beef with scallion, one of the soup noodles, and some other dishes. But now we just order enough soup dumplings (usually two orders) to fill us up and nothing else!

Oh and this place is ALWAYS crowded. So if you go during lunch or dinner time, they'll probably make you share a table with other people. You can always hear some pretty interesting conversations...",1
"Bring on the soup dumplings!!

I still cannot believe I've only recently been introduced to soup dumplings!  And...months later, I still cannot get enough.  There's something special about eating a piece of dough with meat and soup exploding in your mouth.  If that isn't ""magic"" (in food at least), then I don't know what magic is.

Asian Shanghai Manor (as my first place of soup dumplings) will always have a special place in my heart...but I was really excited to finally try Joe's Shanghai after hearing so many raving things about it.  The soup dumplings were amazing here!  They actually do taste better than those at Asian Shanghai's, and service is extremely fast here.  The scallion pancakes are great as well, but Asian Shanghai's is much chewier.  We also ordered a stir fried noodle seafood dish.  It was a little too dry and crunchy for my taste, so I would recommend to go with a lo mein or noodle soup instead.

This place is crowded, so make sure your party's ok with waiting for a while.  Also, you will most likely not get a table of your own, but it's also kind of neat to share a table with a party (or two) with strangers.  The people I sat with were extremely friendly and tourists, and they were just as excited to eat there as I was.

Definitely a must-try at least once when you're in Chinatown!  But, otherwise...let me stick with my bias of Asian Shanghai.",1
"Secret. I think that Ginger place down the block is the same restaurant. Their soup dumpling tasted the same and line is like 10 times shorter.

I am wondering what I can say so that It's not the same as everyone told you about this place. 1. long ass line every day any day. 2. order soup dumpling 3. share table is common 4. order more dumpling to go 

I started coming here during college and it never stopped. I tried other places and there are second best dumpling and THIS IS THE BEST no doubt. however, if you can justify waiting in the cold for a warm dumpling, do so. There are other place to try like a bit over to East broadway for some authentic chinese dumpling and down the shanghai fried bum is good too. 

Anyway if your asian friend in this case most likely chinese bring you here, just say sure and go ahead with it. Never doubt. If you are hungry, it's not a good idea to go here cuz you might eat someone before eating anything. good luck.",1
"I can sit here and give an account of all the dishes I ate here or I can just tell you why you're really here. The food isn't superb. It's safe. It's one of the more recently and intricately decorated restaurants in Chinatown that you would hope that other spots would follow suit because we all want a nice and shiny Chinatown. 

This restaurant is a great choice for both locals AND tourists alike. It's where when the Asian guy starts dating a white girl, to bring her to to ease in the hyper niche stuff. It's where all the mid-west tourist families that want to sample soup dumplings for the first time and not have their ungrateful bratty kids not scream for CHICKEN NUGGEEEETS. And when they do, you can order them the General Tso's chicken and wonder if you really love them and then come to the conclusion that you do, regardless of how uncultured they are.

I think the portions are small for the price and I think they can get away with it because where else are you going to go for this level of ethnic standardization in Chinatown?... HUH? The soup dumplings are unfortunately OK. This is heartbreaking news as this is what blew up the restaurant. I think it's because they have to constantly crank them out. Victims of their own success?

I'd like to further add that don't get the pan fried noodles. It's my favorite dish to get at Cantonese restaurants but they just do it so differently that I wouldn't want that to be the impression to you (yes you, the white girl who just started dating that handsome Asian guy).

And I'd come here again! Because I forgot to mention, it's great for groups. Tony the Tiger would approve. Asians call it ""Family Style"" but in the business industry they call it ""Tourism"", as they lick their lips. Come to think of it, I noticed they didn't have the spinning table wheel that's usually meant to help share. Is Family Style dying?",1
"Everytime I'm in NY, I always make a beeline for Joe's Shanghai for their crab and pork dumplings!!!  They are the BEST I've ever had and I have yet to find another restaurant that does this, can't even find it in San Francisco.  You notice that everyone that goes there ALWAYS orders this house specialty, it would be shameful not to order it!  I enjoy the other items on their menu but my focus is always on the dumplings.  The service is not too bad for such a crowded place (the wait is worth it!) and they get you in and out quickly!",1
"We came on a Sunday night for dinner and we ended up having to wait around 30 minutes before getting a table which is not bad. This place is pretty efficient in what they do so they get patrons in and out pretty quickly so the next group can get on in. And no seat was empty -- they would seat couples at a large table with a family if two seats were available at the table! AWKWARD! But anyway, the soup dumplings are freakin' huge and freakin' delicious!! We ordered the crab & pork -- each was full of delicious liquid!! Just amazing!! We also ordered a plate of the Shanghai noodles -- so greasy but so so so good!! This seriously was an awesome meal for 2 at only $20 total. You can't beat that!",1
Great food long wait once you're in your golden.  food is really good it would be nice to know upfront more of a wait time and that it is a cash only environment but overall great place hard to get to but worth the wait,1
"We made Joe's Shanghai our last meal in NYC. 45 mins wait for a party of 4 on a late Sunday night = enough time to stroll through Chinatown and into Little Italy for quick sightseeing and to work up our appetites. 

I love the suspense and seriousness from everybody waiting outside. Whenever somebody gets called in for a precious seat, they can't help  grinning and rejoicing for the food they're one step closer to. Once inside, I adore the camaraderie feeling of the restaurant by sharing a round table with strangers. Everybody had a smiling face happy to be feasting on some good eats.


green onion pancake/cong you bing/ - the dish I always and must order when I'm at a new restaurant. One of THE best cong you bing I've ever had. All of my friends agreed as well. I love how the pancake wasn't too oily yet crispy to the nth degree. 

shanghai dumpling/xiao long bao/ - juicyjuicyjuicy! the soup inside the XLB is flavorful and the filling melts in your mouth. 

We also ordered noodles and a veggie dish which both were on par as well.


A quick note on the service: I was sitting facing the AC vent. I applaud the server who noticed I put on my jacket during my meal. Even though I wasn't that bothered by the AC vent, the server without anybody asking took the initiative to adjust the AC vent so air will flow in another direction.

I hope Joe's will be just as great the next time I visit New York.",1
"DERMAGERD Soup Dumplings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

On a serious note, if TSA wouldn't get mad at me for purchasing a suitcase, filling it with these soup dumplings, and bringing them back to California with me, I totally would have done it.

Probably the best Chinese food I have EVER had.  Highly recommend.  

If it isn't obvious, get the soup dumplings.",1
"Very busy place. Be advised if ur party doesn't fill the table they will sit strangers with u lol. It was very interesting. Know what u want b/c it's a fast process. Waiter wasn't very patient, but it wasn't a major issue for me. Dumpling appetizer thingy was good and this was the best fried rice I've had. Their ginger dip was bomb!!! I would recommend the place. BE ADVISED CASH ONLY!!!",1
"We have been coming to Joe's since the 90s when they were originally located on Pell Street in Chinatown. There is one in Midtown and one in Flushing, New York (Queens). This current one is located at 46 Bowery. The last time we were here was in 2018 and the location on Pell Street was still open.

This is our ""go to"" spot in Chinatown for when we visit. We went with the crab and pork soup dumplings, Shanghai flat noodles and the roasted pork with vegetables. All were good dishes and the quality and taste were the same. The food here is consistently good and the service was quick. 

The new spot has a different layout and is brighter and cleaner than the last place. Gone mostly are the large round tables. They had a few in the rear of the dining room. The last place had them as the primary seating for patrons. The complementary tea is also not offered any longer. 

Overall Joe's is a nice spot in Chinatown. It is a tourist trap of sorts and the prices have definitely gone up! It's cash only and there is an ATM in front by the door.",1
"The dumplings are to die for!!!! Beware the %15 service charge. Should I have tipped on top of the service charge? I don't know, but we did end up doing so.",1
"Love  coming here to this place!! Been here several times with friends and family. I mostly come for the soup-filled dumplings!!! But the rest of the food here is good too. It's a no-fail favorite, as well as a must have per visit to NYC.",1
"Bigger, newer, cleaner, and certainly more modern and comfortable... Joe's is back in a huge way on the Bowery!",1
Long waits but worth it for the soup dumplings. Lots of good dishes on the menu. Good drinks. Good service once you get a table. Reasonable prices.,1
I don't care if it's not as authentic as some other places in Chinatown.  It's jaw-droppingly delicious. It's hot. It's spicy. It's served with rice.  The green beans are sauteed with bits of pickled mustard and pork.  The soup dumplings are just right.  And that's enough for 5 stars from me.,1
"Still got it! 

After missing coming here last time due to the new location, I finally made it on this trip.

Soup dumplings taste as good as ever, juicy. I tried the Guota tofu (a braised tofu dish with spinach this
time) and it's great too!

The skin is not the thinnest, but the flavor and gelatinous soup can't be beat. Maybe it's the fond memories I have of coming here with my grandma as a child. 

Will be back again soon!",1
"We came upon this place on a whim. We had about 48 hours in New York and one of the locals recommended this place to us for good dumplings. There is usually a line but we (party of 2) were seated in about 30 minutes. The bustling atmosphere and community style seating gives you the full NY experience. We got two orders of dumplings- pork and crab soup dumplings and fried pork dumplings. The food came out hot and fast! I really enjoyed the soup dumplings, the filling is juicy and quite flavorful. Would recommend ducking in here for a taste!",1
"I first ate at Joe's Shanghai (at their OG location) several years ago and recall the xiaolongbao here being just all right. I recently dined at their new location and, I don't know if it was the fact that their new interior decor is just so much better and put me in a more generous mood or if they changed chefs, but the food was fantastic! I had the pork XLB (if you order just one thing, this should be it), which were flavorful, plenty juicy and not overly oily. In my ranking of New York City soup dumplings, the XLBs here might not be #1 but definitely rank within the top 3. We also ordered the vegetable lo mein, which were also very good and much better than I expected. It's also not super greasy, but just really well cooked with great flavors. It's a great option for vegetarians here.",1
Best soup dumplings in the city. Get about one or two full orders of the pork soup dumplings per person and that's it. Monthly tradition spot for me and my friends,1
"One sentence - This place is a NYC staple. 
Enough said.

Literally with 4 friends, we scarfed down 8 orders of soup dumplings of all different kinds of variety (crab and pork). Personally, my favorite is pork. They do have a few other dishes you can try, but I come for the soup dumplings.

Tip: Go to the flushing location, you won't be waiting in line to get a table.",1
"The XLB was ok.  The pancakes were even better.  All the other stuff was pretty greasy.  Comparing it to Din Tai Fung and some good San Francisco dumpling places, they are all the same level for XLB.",1
"This place lives up to the hype.  Always busy, they give you a number and seat you at a large round table with others.  Soup dumplings are spectacular, their reputation is deserved.  If you haven't eaten them before, ask your waiter to show you how--the soup inside is hot! Mapo tofu was also prepared nicely, and they spice it to your request.  When you are seated there will be a pot of hot tea waiting for you--I find that to be a nice touch.  Don't forget--cash only.",1
TASTY soup dumplings!! Their xlb is on the thicker/bigger side but so so delicious!! We got takeout but the restaurant looks super cute inside and always bustling!,1
"The pork soup dumplings were off the hook! The long line and wait was definitely worth it. I know authentic dim sum when I see it, this place is a hidden gem.",1
Soup dumplings were the best. It was the right amount of soup and meat. The crispy duck was tasty. The quail app was a little dry. There's already a 15% gratuity added no matter what. Don't over tip if you don't want to.,1
"Good service, and really good food for the price you pay. We ordered fresh bacon w/ preserved veggies (very nom), clams w/ blackbean sauce (nom nom too), string beans, snow pea leaves, and pan fried noodles (not so nom kinda greasy actually). Considering it's my first time in NYC, it was really good Chinese food and we were very satisfied with our meal..... also pork dumplings were delish",1
"Best Chinese food in NYC if you don't mind waiting and sitting with randos. Delicious food, efficient staff in basic surroundings.",1
"Since there's 2500+ reviews on this place already, I'll make this quick and easy:

Quick tips: Cash only. Tourist Spot. Hole in the Wall. Well-priced. 

Food tips: 
-Pork soup dumplings are great. 
- Crab and pork soup dumplings are interesting. 
- Green beans with pork are delicious but pricey $9.95
-Stir-fried noodles taste...americanized.

Long story short: pork soup dumplings",1
"I love this place! It's one of top go to Shanghai places to eat at in Chinatown.

I would always come here at early to make sure I get a table. There's always a line waiting for the restaurant to open at 11, so I would come here early in the afternoon. Once you sit down, the waiters usually ask if you would like an order of soup dumplings. IT'S A MUST! They're really delicious and hot. 

Also order scallion pancakes if you come here early enough. There was this one time I went around 4 in the afternoon, and the scallion pancakes weren't as crispy as the time I last ordered them. I like the Kau Fu there also. I'm not sure if that's what it's called in english, but it's a cold side dish fish with a special Shanghai sauce. The rest of the food on the menu is mediocre. 

The service is alright. They would often hand us the bill, hurrying my table to leave when there isn't a long line waiting outside.",1
"Overall, a solid Chinese XLB restaurant that caters to their Western customers. The classic XLB was filled with delicious soup broth, skin slightly thicker than I'd like but overall very good. 

We also ordered the scallion pancake which has a lovely buttery and flakey texture, sesame chicken which was over breaded and the Shanghai stir fried noodles (saltier than I'd like). I went with none-Asian friends and they absolutely loved every item we ordered and could not stop raving about the food. I'm happy they enjoyed the meal but I'd be a bit more selective about certain items if I was dining with my mom/family members lol 

All in all, a great dining experience but not as outstanding as the hype suggests.",1
"Don't go here for dinner, it's always way crowded. Late lunch might be a better bet, you'll be able to relax, drink some tea, and enjoy your 'xiao long bao' in peace. 

So unlike the Peking Duck in Chinatown, the xiao long bao (or soup dumplings) are just as good as they are in China (Shanghai), no really. The traditional buns are typically made with crab and pork, but for some reason I prefer the plain pork. And yes, remember that the liquid inside is burning hot! 

It's not actually 'soup' but melted 'meat jelly' so it technically can be hotter than boiling water. 

Lots of other stuff here is pretty decent as well, but hey 8 dumplings (one steamer basket) makes a pretty good lunch right?",1
"Oh Wow! This place was awesome, usually not a big fan of Chinatown NYC but this place is worth coming back! Highly recommend the Soup Dumplings! Service was quick and portion was  great - taste at the right priced!
However if you come at a wrong time you might have to wait outside, so come early!",1
"I've been away from the ny food scene for so long, any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown tastes good. 

Joe's Ginger is not Joe's Shanghai. I got confused bc how many joe soup dumplings can there be? My friend who lives here told me that they are owned by the same owner... Joe? 

Do not go on a romantic date here. Not unless if you enjoy the company of a stranger third wheel at your table. Yes, I saw this happen. They split tables with labeled tags. There is an automatic 15% tip then, tax on top of the bill+ tip. 

Soup dumplings here has always been the best I've ever had, I haven't been to too many, but they seem to have all the right components: just thick enough skin, lots of soup, a nice flavorful meatball filling in the middle. 
Scallion pancakes are awesome too: it's very crispy with flakey layers served with a sweet soy sauce. Their fried rice reminds me something my grandma would make. They use simple ingredients and maybe msg to transform each dish into something to crave for.",1
"The staff is usually brusque and trying to get you in and out as quickly as possible. 

They still charge you 15% automatically for those unpredictable levels of service.

Usually, you have to sit with strangers who are annoying and/or clueless. 

The radio is often tuned to a station that the military could very possibly use to defy the Geneva Conventions and break prisoners of war.

Occasionally the dishes are inconsistently spicy and/or salty making the rating of certain favorites shift from perfect to passable. 

But in general, the majority of the food is so good that you'll overlook all of these nuisances and be hastily shuffled out of the restaurant in a euphoric stupor.

And yes, the soup dumplings are good.",1
"Still love this place. Fun atmosphere. Shared tables. Delicious soup dumplings, crispy beef, sesame chicken and rice. We travel from Chicago to eat here! Marvin our waiter was fabulous",1
"The dishes are shareable and delicious!  We also JD the steamed pork dumplings and they were fantastic.  This restaurant always has a wait but not for long. And it is worth the wait!  If you are in NYC, this is a restaurant you MUST visit!  Fantastic!",1
"Pork.Dumplings. 

Soup. Fried. I love them both equally.

If only I could eat dumplings every day without any repercussions.

A friend and I went here after drinks nearby. We had 15 mins to close and they sat us down although I'm sure they wanted to turn us away.

Food was great. No lines since we got there so late. Typical Chinatown Chinese restaurant vibe that is cash only. Service was ehh but I don't blame them. We were the assholes that came in right before close.

I will be back. #dumplingsforever",1
"The BEST soup dumplings ever! 

Make sure that's the first thing you try when order or dine there!",1
"The pork and crab dumplings were vvery good. The skin was more chewy that the dumpligs at Shanghai Cafe and it was great that you taste real crabs, not artificial.
We had the Shanghai fried noodles which at first glance looked like it was not cooked well because the noodles were all stuck together. Then the wsiter stsrted cutting it and serving. I guess it was ment to stick together. It turned out quite good. The noodles were actually nice and chewy.
I don't know if I would come here often, because there's usually a long line and long wait to get in.",1
"I came here with my sister for lunch when it was pretty crowded, so we got sat down at a table with other people. It was a round table and they were able to fit three parties at the table. It wasn't too awkward though since the table is relatively big and everyone minded their own business. 

We ordered the crab xiao long bao and seafood pan fried noodles. The soup dumplings were very flavorful, and they definitely had a great mixture of the pork and crab in the dumplings. The pan fried noodles were delicious as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the perfectly crisped noodles with the savory sauce and lots of seafood! Joe's is a great place in Chinatown worth checking out!",1
"Down the alley known as Pell Street in Chinatown is Joe's Shanghai. Out of the three that exist in the city, this is the best of them all. A tourist trap - absolutely, but I have yet to taste a better pork soup dumpling in Manhattan. Is it really worth the 45 minute wait during dinner time, probably not since I think the soup dumplings here are just marginally better than some other Shanghai-nese restaurants such as Moon House, New Green Bo or Shanghai Cafe which have shorter waits.",1
"Is it worth the hype? Yes. 
Is it worth waiting in the cold for a table? Yes, the experience is worth it. 
Is it different because it is not at the old place? Let's just say you feel intimate with your fellow diners. 

We came for the dim sum. Stayed for the experience and the tea. 

If you are NY, swing by and enjoy the dim sum. Also, get a snack because the wait is part of the experience. 

This is one where I forgot the pictures.",1
"YUM!  

here's what to order when you first sit down.  depending on how many people you have...my friend and i usually get an order right when we sit down cuz it takes a while for them to make.  we only get an order per 2 people.  then when we're almost done with order another one, this way they are always HOT.  :)

~crab and pork soup dumpling (preferred)
~pork soup dumplings (are also good)
~shanghai noodles
~stir fried rice cake
~vegetarian duck (which is tofu wrapped black mushrooms, its a cold dish)
~the scallion pancake is decent there too",1
"If you're coming to Joe's Shanghai, prepare to wait at least an hour before you get seated. I went with a group of five during the evening, and although the wait was long, the food was definitely worth the wait.

The pork xiao long bao is a must-try! The pork dumping was more flavorful than the shrimp. Each batch has eight pieces, all decently large. The fried calamari is the best I've ever had; lightly fried but very flavorful and has a slight kick from the peppers. The beef and broccoli is honestly very flavorful and pairs perfectly with rice. The ja jiang mien was okay; I wouldn't get it again. The sauce was much sweeter and had a strong peanut flavor; it tasted like spring roll peanut sauce.

Overall, the food is delicious and comes out of the kitchen pretty fast. I would definitely come back and try more dishes. Highly recommend.",1
"Pork soup buns or dumplings were pretty good. That was what everyone was basically getting. That's what they're known for apparently. 

There was no wait but spaces are small so they sat us down with random people around a table. This is common in New York? Still something to get used to. 

We ordered the scallion pancakes and the turnip cakes. Liked the scallion more. 

We had two orders of the dumplings. They were soupy and delicious. 

They have pics of famous people on their wall that's fun to look at.",1
Good authentic Chinese food. You may have to share a table with strangers but that is part of the charm!,1
We ventured into Chinatown and headed to Joes after a friend recommended.  The dumplings were absolutely amazing.  We did share a table but it was part of the experience and we totally didn't mind.  It was busy but very short wait.  Wish I could take some home with me!  I'm sure I won't be able to find anything like that at home!  Must try.,1
This place was yummy for sure. They were filming a movie on the street and so we didn't have to wait as long. The service was very efficient and I appreciated that. The pork soup dumplings were awesome. We also ordered the general tsos chicken and the shrimp fried rice. Great food for the price!!,1
"i love this place. it was surprisingly tasty and very afforadble. my group of 6 had 8 dishes for about 10$ a person. from the soup dumplings to the wonton soup to the other stuff haha. its nice to know all chinese places are basically set up the same. family style plating with plenty of seating. a rarity in ny. 

this place was quite deep into china town so be careful of shady people but the great part is you get to experience the town. 

def would come here again.",1
"Quite simply, this is where to go for great chinese.  Why do I say , ""quite simply""?  Any yelper can throw away any notion of ambiance or a dimly lit romantic dinner.  This is the real Chinatown.  Lights up, no manners, and an 'get in and get out' attitude-yet the food makes up for any perceived rudeness.

There will be a line.  Go up and tell the door lady how many are in your party.  She'll give you a number, and despite the long line, they are incredibly fast.  You will be taken to a large table to eat with strangers unless you have a large party.  If there is one chair available at your table?  It will inevitably be filled by a stranger, but it was still a pleasant arrangement.

When seated, expect to be yelled ""DUMPLINGS?!?!"" almost immediately.  It is one of their most popular items, and why many travel to eat there.  The crab/pork dumplings were incredible.  In the menu they have their popular items already outlined.  We ordered standard items (general tso's chicken and calamari with black bean), and were amazed by the freshness and overall quality of ingredients.

When dinner is done, they bring free oranges for dessert, and automatically put 15% tip on your bill.  Remember... CASH ONLY!

I'd definitely go back for the food and fast pace that makes this one of the best in Chinatown.",1
"Came here just for the soup dumplings!

Got an order of the regular and the crab xlb. The xlb here were so huge! And were full of soup

They were good, but not amazing. Pretty average compared to LA",1
"The BEST dumplings in NYC. 


No reservations, walk in and cash only.
Also they might sit you at a table with parties.",1
"I was a fan of the whole experience...as some other reviewers point out, this place is a little divey, you sit with strangers, and the waiters are pushy. BUT the dumplings are pretty tasty, the food comes out fast and the price is good. Dining here made me feel like i was on an episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. I'll definitely stop in on my next visit to NYC to try the crab,pork dumplings.",1
"Holy dumplings, Batman! A friend suggested we celebrate the lunar new year here for lunch so off we went. Even with the holiday - the streets were thick with confetti - we only waited about 20 minutes to sit down. Not bad.

Together we ordered four dishes: the shredded pork and salted vegetable noodle soup (3 stars), the Shanghai fried flat noodle (4 stars), the pork dumplings (5 stars), and the crab/pork dumplings (5 stars). The dumplings were easily the best; we ate so many and left feeling so full, we felt like dumplings ourselves. 

Be warned: you'll be sharing a table with strangers. But you're a New Yorker, and you're okay with that, right? No? Then move to Kansas; I hear there's lots o' space out there.",1
I still think Din Tai Fung has the best soup dumplings but this place comes in close behind,1
"WHY am I still seeing groups of tourists waiting 30 minutes to sit down at Joe's just to order some Kung Pao Chicken? I usually refrain from reviewing overly hyped places, but seriously! Enough is enough!

SOO...Okay tourists. This one is for you. Yes you. Read this review before you make the silly mistake of eating General Tso's Chicken when you should be eating....

Pork and Crab Soup Dumplings: Order this as soon as you sit down. It takes awhile to steam up. There are 8 in an order, I imagine the average person can pack away at least 4, so base your order off of this metric.

These are not normal dumplings. DO NOT just stab it with your fork and shove into mouth. YES I HAVE SEEN THIS. AND IT MAKES MY HEART ACHE. I realize that most cultured people know how to eat soup dumplings, but I feel the need to explain here. Maybe someone else has explained but it is buried among the 1000 reviews. 

They are called soup dumplings because they have HOT SOUP INSIDE! 

1. Put some of the soy sauce-vinegar-ginger  (in the small dish they set in front of you) in the spoon. The vinegar cuts the grease of the soup and adds a nice tang to your palette. 

2. Use your chopsticks (or tongs if you don't have chopstick mastery) and very gently pick up the dumpling from the top (where they twisted the dough together to close the dumpling). Place the dumpling on top of your spoon.

3. VERY GINGERLY bite a SMALL HOLE in the side of the soup dumpling and IMMEDIATELY start to slowly suck the soup from the dumpling. Careful it is VERY HOT.

4. Once you have gotten most of the soup. Go ahead and eat the rest of the dumpling.

What else do I recommend ordering? Well, you can't go wrong with the scallion pancake (dip in the sauce they bring you, add some hot chili oil). Also, I like the Shanghai Fried Flat Noodle. They use a chewy, almost Udon-noodle like noodle and stir fry it with pork and Chinese bokchoy. Authentic version of lo mein.

I also like the fried rice cake. If you've ever had Korean food, you've probably had rice cake (Duk, or in dukboki). They take this and stir fry with veggies and/or meat. So like lo mein with rice cake.

Okay. Now that I've written this lengthy review, I won't be seeing any more SQUIRTING of soup wasted onto your plate, and blah looking Americanized Chinese food, right?? I hope so!",1
"Crab meat dumplings and scallion pancakes are my top choices in this restaurant. Been here plenty of time, those 2 items were a must order every time I go here. Awesome food. Crowded atmosphere. If you are a party of 4 or less, the chances of you having to share tables is very high. If you don't mind that, then this place is a must visit!",1
"The pork and crab soup dumplings are amazingly delicious.  The sauce isn't really needed since there's so much flavor in the dumplings.
I would give this place 5 stars, but there was open seating.  You would share a big round table with other customers.  The waiters were pushing us to order right when we sat down.  We didn't get to look at the menu yet, but luckily the waiter was nice because we were able to speak chinese.

*edit* On my second visit back to NY, I had to come for more delicious dumplings.  Ordered green onion pancakes again, pork & crab dumplings and rice cake with chicken.  I remembered the pork dumplings tasting much better last time, but it was still good.  My favorite is still the CRAB DUMPLINGS! FULL OF FLAVOR!",1
"The wait was about 1 1/2 hours. Once they called our number, we felt as if we won the lottery. The food is great and not too expensive. Overall a good experience despite the long wait for a table.",1
"PROS:
-crab Xiao long bao

CONS:
- You must have everyone in your party present in order to get seated. I am little annoyed at this. Even if the majority came you can't be seated until everyone is there. Such a strict rule too. See my grandparents are old so they take a longer time to walk to get there so they wouldn't seat us until everyone is there. By the time my grandparents came, the table was gone. 
- Also be prepared to share tables with other people if your party is small.",1
"The restaurant is a very busy one, with a size being small as well. So keep in mind that you'll be waiting. They have small tables and also large tables. We had a party of 8 so it was quite a while. They seat people as soon as a party leaves but it varies by size, not by the order you placed your name. We waited for a little over an hour and got seated at a large table but it was community style. The other half of the table was with strangers but I personally liked it because food brings all types of people together. *truth* you obv don't have to talk to them if you don't want to. 

What's great about eating at an Asian restaurant is that there is a dish for everyone. So, I am pescatarian, so I eat seafood but not any traditional meats like red and chicken. So I ordered a shrimp noodles dish. There was broccoli and other vegetables but the noodles come hard. And you have to mix the shrimp and veggies together with the sauce to make the noodles not as hard. But it was honestly one of the better dishes, even the meat eaters agreed. I didn't get to try other Chinese restaurants in the area because we didn't have a whole lot of time in New York, but I would def recommend this spot!",1
"The food is super good!  The shanghai dumplings are so juicy and good.  Every time I come to NY, I have to stop by for dumplings!",1
"While exploring the alleyways of Chinatown my girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place not knowing it was a popular attraction for amazing soup dumplings. We spent the morning walking around and worked up quite the appetite and we were drawn to this spot due to the long line right outside of the storefront. Being avid yelpers we decided to see what all the hype was about! we were not disappointed. We got the pork and crab soup dumplings as well as sesame chicken and WOW were we satisfied! The dumplings were so amazing and filled with flavor, it was exactly what we needed. We have never had a better order of sesame chicken anywhere else. The chicken was perfectly crispy and flavorful. I can definitely say we will be back on our next trip to NYC. THANK YOU!",1
"Came here to try their ever so popular soup dumplings and now I'm wondering if there's any possible way I can get them shipped to me in Houston. These soup dumplings definitely live up to all the hype. They have the most delicious broth inside that just burst into your mouth when you take a bite.. it's dumpling heaven. 

Other than the crab and pork soup dumplings, we ordered the Shanghai noodles and scallion pancake. Both were delicious. The noddles were a little on the oiler side but oiler the tastier right ? There was also complimentary tea wish was perfect for the weather outside. At the end of the meal, they give you sliced oranges and a wet towel which is super nice. 

Something that I found funny is that once we sat down, our waiter came to us and asked ""do you want soup dumplings ?"" Instead of the typical, ""what would you like to drink ?"" It's like they know what everyone comes here for !! 

Tips for if you're wanting to have the amazing experience of Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings: don't go on the weekend if you're not willing to wait hours and BRING CASH.",1
The crab dumplings are good. It gets busy and crowded at lunch on a weekday. I ordered for takeout and didn't need to wait in line during lunch time.,1
Really great place! The food is very authentic and not too pricy. They actually check your vaccine cards before you dine in which I think it's a great idea! High recommend their soup dumplings!,1
"What else can I say that hasn't been said already? Go for NYC's best soup dumplings!! 

Joe's is always packed. It doesn't matter if it's dinnertime during the week or lunch on Saturday afternoon: there will be a wait. Also be ready to be sit down family style with complete strangers at large round tables.  Only makes the experience better.  Service is pretty quick. The longest thing you would have to wait for is to sit down.  I've never had an issue with the servers; they've always been pretty quick. Just a reminder, they are CASH ONLY. Prices are pretty cheap. They also have an extensive menu with other Chinese items, but I tend to stick to the dumplings only. 

There are two types of soup dumplings: pork or crab. Personally, I can't decide which one is better so I get both. Each bamboo steamer comes with about 8 steaming dumplings. The broth is oh, so good and the meat is well seasoned. The dough is chewy enough, without it being too dense.  The flavor of the dumplings just pop in your mouth with each bite.  I guarantee these dumplings will hit the spot on a cold winter day. 

This is definitely a must try if you are in Chinatown.",1
For me the best soup dumplings  ever ever and soooo cheap. Place is only simple but you don't go here for that go for the soup dumplings then go further for some other Chinese if you are not full,1
"I came here after watching a Fung Bros video on this place. I never had soup dumplings and always wanted to try it out. Apparently Joe's Shanghai is the best in the east side so I was really excited to go! 

The store was really easy to find in chinatown and when I went inside the restaurant, half of the seats were filled. We were placed in a round table with two other families and I was surprised at how famous this place is! There were pictures of I'm guessing the owner with other celebrities like Jonah Hill and Emma Stone!

When I saw the menu, it was like a typical Chinese restaurant menu with a variety of dishes like noodles, meats, and seafood. Of course we opted for the soup dumplings and I thought there would be a huge variety but there was only two! So there was a regular meat one and a meat with crab. We got both and the dumplings came in approx 10 mins, even though our waiter said it takes more than 20.

Pictures don't do it justice but holy these dumplings were ginormous! I mean they give you tongs to pick them up.

The soup in these dumplings were oh my god, heavenly! Be careful not to pop them and rip the skin! I loved the crab one because they put actual roe in it, giving it a really nice taste and texture.

Only downside is the customer service. I felt like they were pushing us out even though the restaurant still had empty seats.",1
Dumplings where amazing & service was fast. Will go back for sure when I'm in the city,1
"I ate here while visiting New York for the first time and I have to say that their ""Xiao Long Bao"" without a doubt is way better than Din Tai Fung (in Arcadia). Not only were they moist but they are also bigger in size. 

It was a bit of a pain getting a table if your entire party is not present because they will not seat you until everyone is around (sounds familiar). Other than that our food came out in a reasonable amount of time considering they were busy on a Monday night. 

Definitely a must try for anyone visiting from out of town.",1
"Soup dumplings, everything else is irrelevant, you don't go to a burger shop to other a hotdog then why come here for anything else",1
"Yummy food. The soup dumplings were so good! However wish they had a bigger variety. We had the pork soup dumplings and the crab soup dumpling and both great!! The Singapore noodles were good as well. The sesame chicken was actually a favorite!

The service was meh. Very crowded and overwhelming. Not some place to come for a quiet dinner! Our glasses were very dirty but it seemed that was normal.",1
"We had lunch but hubby wanted something shanghainese since we visited Shanghai last year, he missed their food.
We order the scallion pancakes, the soup dumplings (of course), and the fried dumplings. The crab meat soup dumpling had a good flavor to it, you can tell the crab meat was fresh and sweet. The fried dumplings are ok, not very special. The best was the scallion pancake! The dough was perfectly chewy, the pancakes were fried to perfection, soft inside and crispy outside! Love love love! 
The place was so busy, even on a Monday afternoon. We had to share a table with some strangers. Which was ok with me.",1
"The best dumpling soup ever. I ordered the scallion pancakes and dumpling soup (8 piece per order). You won't be disappointed. It was heaven! Small restaurant and you share tables with others. The food comes out fast. Other dishes were good as well like the seafood fried rice cakes. By the way, don't expect any good service here... It's a Chinese restaurant! LOL",1
"Soup dumplings, soup dumplings! Yeah I've never ordered anything else there, besides a few bowls of rice. Definitely get the pork soup dumplings. It gets a little crowded, and wait times depend... and you may also have to share your table with other patrons too, but just pretend they're not there.",1
"Pork Soup Dumplings. Divine. 

A friend and I have been faithfully going here for dumplings (MUCH prefer the pork over the pork and crab combo) every two weeks for the past six years. It's sick but it's true.

On weeknights, if you arrive by 7pm, you don't have to wait. Since we've become regulars here the waitstaff has actually started being nice to us which is confusing and wonderful at the same time. No longer must we wait for water, no longer are we told, ""NO"" when we ask for that ""um sauce, you won't tell us what it's called but it tastes kind of like...""

Going to Joe's is one of the reassuring rituals in my life. I even like sitting next to all the out of towners and giving them suggestions about what to do in NYC. Except for the one time our table got in a political argument, it's always been fun to sit family-style. Encouraging, even. It sort of makes me want to sing ""We Are the World."" And then tell the tourist next to me she's a wimp for getting shots before visiting India.

Get bubble tea afterwards at Green Tea Cafe to round out the evening.",1
"The soup dumplings deserve their reputation. I could eat several of the steamer baskets myself. However, the noodles and fried rice my friends ordered were average.

Yes, there is a certain way to eat the dumplings. I made an ass out of myself but NOT b/c of lack of technique. My brain apparently does not understand the correlation of steam and hot. I bit into the dumpling and tried slurping out the soup. I didn't know it was going to be that damn hot (temperature wise). So, I ended up splattering the dumpling all over my plate. This was seconds before telling my friend ""yes, I KNOW how to eat them"". His look of disapproval was paid back by him burning the back of his throat as he swallowed the soup. I was told that swallowing vitamin E liquid quickly helps the pain. I withheld this information from him in case he went to Duane Reade for this remedy. Smugness should always be remembered.",1
"How to do Joe's Shanghai:

Come during ""off"" hours.  I.E., not lunchtime or dinner time. 
Be prepared to share a table if you are not a party of five or more. 
Order ""soup dumplings"" or xiao long bao and a Tsingtao.  Don't order anything else, it's just mediocre.
Pour yourself some tea while you wait for your food.  The tea also washes down the oil. 
Eat and drink.  To eat xiao long bao, put one on your spoon and either have the top or side of the dumpling.  The soup should spill on your spoon and this will help cool it because scalding soup in your mouth sucks.  When cool enough go ahead and eat.  Enjoy your drinks. 
Pay in cash when done.  A service charge is already added so if you tip more, you're extremely generous. 
Restrooms are in the back of the restaurant and are very basic. 
Enjoy the rest of your day!",1
"I assumed there was no point to life. 
Then there was Xiaolongbao, and Joes serves my favorite.",1
"I don't really care if the soup dumplings are famous or not.. my aunt and uncle took me there and after a bit of crab soup dumplings, I'm thinking, ""damn, why don't other places make this?!""",1
"I've been here for a while and I always walk out satisfied. I go with my mom or dad during lunch time. It's more relaxed and less people, as opposed to dinner time. One round of crab-meat dumplings is enough for my dad and I. The soup is the best part of the meal, just be careful not to let it explode all over the place! Definitely take a visit for a decent sized meal and price.",1
"If you're so hungry and your stomach is grinding itself, you might want to have a small snack before you come to this place to keep your sanity.  The wait is pretty long... 20-40 mins during lunch time.  I was dying when i went... especially hung over from the night before, it wasn't a fun wait.

Finally when it's our turn to sit down, the waiter led us to a small table facing the wall, and 2 people already sitting at the table.  I looked at the waiter, and he said, ""sit here""...  my husband, being an american and never been to Asia, his jaw dropped...  

i guess they're doing it real asian style, squeezing everyone and their mother in and occupy every seat!  

Then, before we even got tea or water or menu... the waiter assumed that we're going to order the soup dumpling, he said, ""pork soup dumpling ok?""  I was like... okay... sure I was there to eat the soup dumping, but can I sit down first before you take my order...

Sitting at a table with strangers has its perks, one of the girls has been there before and was very helpful on what we should order.  We tried both the pork soup dumpling and the pork and crab soup dumpling, I think the pork flavor over power the dumplings, can't really taste the crab in the 2nd one.  So next time I would just get the pork one.

We also got some typical chinese dishes, like stirfried rice cake, some chinese broccoli, you know, you gotta work your veggies in.  The green onion pancake is different then the ones I usually have, it's fantastic.  This was a carb filled lunch.

I always wondered what the soup dumpling fuzz is about - after trying it, I gotta say, this whole soup dumpling is a fad.  I grew up eating this dumpling, we called it Xiao Long Bao, it's always been juicy... so I guess I thought when they call it ""soup dumpling"", it's different then the ones I used to eat as a kid from the street vendor in Taiwan....  food was good here, but I guess I'm just a bit disappointed it's no different then the one I know, plus the wait, and I had to sit with the strangers, and the pushy waiter... I knocked it down to 4 stars.",1
"If you don't mind the wait, then you'll love the xiaolongbao at yet another fantastic 4 star place.  I seem to be finding a lot on this trip.  You should stick with the XLB and the green onion pancake.  Both well worth the 30 minute wait.  Not too enamoured with the  noodle dishes and the fried rice cake was oily but quite tasty.

Those who don't appreciate a good XLB should just go somewhere else and maybe reduce the wait time (not likely with all the die hard fans and damned tourists I think) because this could be the best I've ever tasted.",1
"The soup dumplings OMG. So good. You share tables which is a good way to get to know some random strangers. We also had the general tso's chicken. Big chunks of white meat chicken, fresh broccoli and awesome sauce. Hit the ATM bc this joint is cash only.",1
"We came at a really good time - 12pm on Thursday = no wait! Instantly seated! The weird thing about these Chinese New York restaurants though is that all their tables fit all aka, if you're a party of 8 to 10, you'll have your own table. However, if you're 6 of smaller, be prepared to engage in communal tablesharing. 

These over word of mouth places also attracts ppl of all natures, including those who are not very familiar with Chinese food. As a party of two, we shared our table top with two women from New Jersey and a couple visiting from Alaska. In this one hour time frame we educated them about xiao long baos - what they are, how to eat them, how they're made; got the whole table to order the ong-choi and green onion pancakes. Only in America! 

Soup dumplings are divine. We split 8 for two people and combined with the other dishes, I had to be rolled out. Hot, steamy and SUPER fatty. 

The green onion pancakes were much thicker than I would have normally liked, but still good nonetheless. 

Ong-choi was my favorite...I had been craving the taste for days. There's something about this trio of foods that makes it super comforting.  

The moment we left the restaurant, a line was forming and we were glad to have missed it by a heartbeat. To each dumpling, his or her own. Enjoy!",1
"Nice people, quick service, no frills, best pork soup dumplings I've ever had in my life! I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints. Try the shredded turnip cakes too. The shrimp fried rice, meh, though shame on me for ordering shrimp, aka mud puddle bugs, in Chinatown.",1
"You dont come here for the atmosphere, the service, or the location... if you want cheap delicious soup dumplings then look no further.  For $6-7 for an order they are a great bargain in NYC.  Each order contains 8 dumplings.  We usually order Shanghai pan friend flat noodles and they are also excellent.  The noodles come after you finish your dumplings.  If can go with the flow and arent too uptight to wait outside and then get crammed into a very tight restaurant you will be in for a treat.

They serve beer but you are welcome to bring your own wine.  a 15% gratuity is added o your bill automatically.",1
"I'm conflicted between 3 or 4 stars. I say... 3.5 and here's why:
Arrived at 130pm-145pm with a party of 3. The restaurant was at peak lunch hour on a week day. With no where to sit, we are told to wait outside. Fine. After a few minutes, we are called in. We follow the woman inside but she then turns around and there is NO table or space for us- umm...??? Awkward. 

Seating arrangements are interesting- you will most likely be eating a table full of strangers unless you are lucky to get your own table. 

After waiting for another 10mns, we are seated. We ordered pork and crabmeat dumplings and a side of bok choy. The food came out promptly. Our bill was under $37-38. We paid $45 only to find out the GRATUITY WAS ALREADY INCLUDED!!! UGGGH... they didn't even say anything to us... gee thanks. They definitely don't pride themselves in customer service here.",1
"Stopped in at Joe's Shanghai for lunch with a coworker the other day and found this place to be pretty cool! We ended up ordering both types of the soup dumplings (which I have never had before) and found them to be really delicious and cheap. We were watching other foods come out of the kitchen and couldn't stop drooling over all the great looking food coming out. 

Overall, this is great spot, and the soup dumplings are perfect on a chilly day (we went when it was 90 degrees which I don't recommend). 

The only downside is that the tables are shared with small parties, and it is CASH only.",1
"The food is very good and delicious! 

We got lucky and didnt have to wait in the midst of chaos. 

I've never loved soup dumplings like theirs! The sauce they used for the crispy noodles was superb! Not overly thickened with cornstarch or soy, but very well balanced. 

It's a small place, that's very busy for a reason. Dont expect amazing service like a gourmet restaurant. It is a family style place. I kinda felt like I was home. Haha

Come try the food here!",1
"Joe's Shanghai have the best Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) ever! My mom and I came here today to try it for our first time. We ordered the pork with crab meat Xiao Long Bao. One order comes with 8 pieces. It was delicious! We ordered for a second round and we loved it! 

I highly recommend all who craves and loves Xiao Long Bao to come here! Would totally come again!",1
"Not going to lie when I first arrived here and was told the wait was going to be over an hour I was really upset. But once I sat down to eat I was blown away. I had the pork dumplings, Scallion pancake, and the pan fried noodles. 10/10 on all of those.  Food was great and once I was seated service was quick and efficient. I would deff go back",1
"Delicious. The pork soup dumplings were really tasty, but my personal faves were the scallion pancake (OMG so perfectly crispy and salty) and the Shanghai fried flat noodles (great crunch from the cabbage, and the pork in it has a sort of smoky flavor). It's really efficient but sooo crowded. But def worth it.",1
"It's funny, I can't even remember what movie I was watching yesterday, but one of the very first scenes, Joe's popped up on a driveby.  And mind you, the movie was filmed in the early 90's.  So, even back then, this place was prevalent.  Honestly, with how busy this place is, I am shocked there isn't more than 10-15K Yelp reviews.

With that being said, I went on a trip to NY a few months ago with my friends from the Bay.  I wanted to show them what was up with the food scene in NYC.  After gorging on all sorts of stuff, We managed to fit Joe's in on a Saturday night, before they closed.

This place sits in an alley, which, at first glance, it looks terrifying.  Don't worry, the locals just hang out on the street smoking weed (the young ones), and the older ones playing games and singing passing around a bottle of vodka.  With that being said, I didn't feel threatened.

While you wait (which, I would presume 90% of the time there is one), you get a raffle ticket- that is their queue system.  The place is small, so, your best bet is to hang out on the street and soak up the aromas of New Orleans-esque odors (aka sewage).  You may even catch a kitchen staff member or two just sitting outside chillin.  

They keep saying this place is cash only (they have an ATM, so do places down the street if you need one)- however, they may have upped their game.  Needless to say, the whole visit was confusing (and I was sober too), so, bring enough cash (or a loaded debit card) to be safe.  

There were 5 of us, and it looked like we shared a table.  I swear, if they could fit 8 at our table, they would.  With that being said, this place is very, intimate.  One of my buddies is even taller than me, and I was cramped- so I could only imagine how it felt for him.

I ordered the XLB via seafood and meat, along with the potstickers.  Also, had water and tea to drink (fyi, the tea seemed easier to get than the water...).  

Honestly, I wasn't too impressed with the seafood XLB, and it had an off yellow color, like bile- don't spill it on your clothes unless you want to look like a rabies bite victim.  Aside from the looks of the liquid, it just seemed underwhelming.  Mind you though, this place was bringing orders of XLBs out like Katz's slings pastrami sandwiches.  They must have a crew to just make those.

The potstickers were ok, I liked the texture, but the flavor was underwhelming as well.  Maybe that is the way it is supposed to be... But those were probably my favorite items I tried.

When we got our check, we got orange slices- the healthiest thing I ate all day.

I was glad I got to try it for the experience, I will def have to check out the one in Flushing now, but, I can't go with another group that big, I almost got stuck at the table.  Oh yea, and if you are a germophobe- steer clear of this place, just saying...",1
"My Girlfriend and I came to NYC for comic con, and as huge foodies, we had to check out Joe's Shanghai after seeing all of its amazing reviews from other Yelpers. It's located in Chinatown, and you do have to explore the area a bit to find it. Stepping into Joe's Shanghai, the interior is very simple and it does not have the greatest ambiance. The utensils also did not seem that clean, and there were some cracks and chips on my plate, but I guess if you're going here, you came for the food.  There are only round tables that seat 8 people and due to their limited space, they will put strangers next to you if your table is not filled. 

Fortunately, the servers are very efficient and super quick. We only ordered one item, which was the pork soup dumplings. They came out super hot and were a great value, you get 8 pieces for $8.00 (Cash Only). The soup dumplings tasted just like the authentic ones I had in China. The soup is very flavorful and the dumpling skin is light and delicate. 

Overall, if you're in NYC, I would recommend coming to Joe's Shanghai for some authentic Chinese cuisine that doesn't break the bank, and to experience Chinatown.",1
"I've been coming here for about 10+ years now...introduced to by friends. Best soup dumplings I have had by far...and I've searched, believe me. The mixed soup dumplings, shanghai fried rice with a side of scallion pancakes...something that will immediately put you in a delicious and comforting food coma. If you're a local, it's the perfect lunch/dinner; a bit challenging when you're coming from NJ, but parking isn't too bad considering regulations in NYC are strict. You'll always find a spot in China Town! If you go on a weeknight, especially wknd night, expect to wait an hour for a table (a table that you may or may not share with others). Lunch gets quite busy as well, but you're in the clear if you arrive before 12pm. Absolutely worth the wait, regardless.",1
"Joe introduced me to soup dumplings, and now I feel like I'm in a Chuck Norris film on a never ending quest to find soup dumplings of equal or greater quality. I must be in the middle of the movie because nothing has come close, and I'm ready to quit my job and just open my own damn dumpling restaurant.",1
"Based on recommendations from colleagues, I stopped here during my NYC trip around 3pm in the afternoon on a Friday. There were a lot of patrons dining already and we got seated right away BUT we got seated on a big round table with 3 other people already there. Apparently they share tables here to fill up all the seats. 

The server asked if we wanted soup dumplings as it takes 20 mins to cook and we answered yes. We also ordered a plate of fried rice to share. Hot tea was served. Dumplings and fried rice was absolutely delicious, I am a fan!

This place is highly popular as we stared at a wall filled with celebrities who have visited and taken photos with severs and owners. Wish we had our own table for a little privacy but we didn't stay too long as we wanted to explore Chinatown right after. Great little place and won't mind another visit when I'm back in town.",1
Best dang dumpling! I burned my mouth and would do it a thousand more times just to eat these dumplings faster.,1
"I go here every chance I get when I'm in NY! I missed xiao long bao so much from my time living in China, & this was a godsend. They only have 2 types, pork & pork w/ crab. The pork ones are definitely the better of the 2. The scallion pancakes are quite tasty & they offer free Jasmine tea when you sit down. If you're craving your soup dumplings, you can't go wrong!!",1
"their famous soup dumplings never dissapoint.  also delish are the scallion pancakes, the new year's cakes with veggies, the eggplant dish is good enough to convert non-veggie lovers and the double cooked pork (a little spicey) was an enormous hit!  i go here to celebrate chinese new year each year.  it's not much for ambiance, and there is always a wait (even if you reserve) but it's sooooo yummy!  beer only",1
"the best crab soup buns I've ever had. Trust me because I'm from Hangzhou, which is near to Shanghai. 
the skin of the buns is translucent, you can see the juice inside.
The crab soup is perfect, not too salty or fishy, just perfect.
OMG I will definitely miss it.",1
"After taking an Uber to Chinatown whilst in NYC, we stumbled upon this establishment. The people gathered outside waiting for a table, led us to believe we would not be disappointed.

We waited about 20-30 minutes on Saturday night and based on reviews on Yelp, that wasn't too bad. When you go in, expect to sit with strangers because you will. This wasn't an issue for my partner and I, we just weren't expecting it. We were immediately brought a pot of hot jasmine tea, which was much appreciated after having stood in the cold for half an hour. 

After a few minutes of drinking our tea, we noticed that many people were ordering what we thought were dumplings, but they were actually soup dumplings. Since we ordered the regular dumplings, which were very tasty, we didn't get to try the much revered soup dumplings. If you go, try those as they seem very popular.

After ordering our dumplings, we decided on crispy shredded beef and shrimp fried rice. Both were excellent, but the crispy shredded beef stood out with it's citrusy bits of orange peel throughout the dish. 

I would definitely come here again and try other things on the menu or even order some of the same things. Everything we had was exceptionally good.

On a side note, make sure you bring CASH, because they don't accept anything else and the ATM in front looks dodgy.",1
Fantastic. There is a line but the wait usually goes pretty fast. Casual and fast spot to eat! Inexpensive as well! Highly recommend.,1
"Joe's soup dumplings are by far the best thing on the menu. Although everything was good the soup dumplings are a must.
 It's a small restaurant and we were a party of two that shared a table with six other people. I didn't mind just know before you go.",1
"joe's shanghai is probably one of the better XLB places i've eaten at...although nanxiang in flushing is better (thinner dumpling skin and better flavor)...

but you cannot beat joe's for the price...my dining partner and i had one order of the pork XLB http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0CjK3esfpFcxIopebzjFxA?select=I0EnPz6hK1NoJ5rDJ8IHsQ http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=gUkqdzdD0jhqsjM-AZAWVw&select=CZXkIWuDq50BMOPlLxKtbA, one order of pork/crab XLB http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=gUkqdzdD0jhqsjM-AZAWVw&select=JRlQHMi3kfP23NSfsDhdRg, scallion pancakes, and the shanghai noodles with shrimp http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0CjK3esfpFcxIopebzjFxA?select=DnlLxSU6lisgvUGRe8wlsw...

the XLBs were very juicy, the scallion pancake was crispy with a fair amounts of scallions http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=gUkqdzdD0jhqsjM-AZAWVw&select=wj0pbsVi0x1X0hPgjcjWEQ, and the noodles were packed with shrimp...*drool*

i think i need a large bore IV started so i can get a XLB broth infusion...

NB:  make sure you go inside and grab a number and not waste any time waiting outside...",1
"The best soup dumplings ever! I always make sure to stop here when I'm in New York City because they definitely do not disappoint. So juicy and soupy and delicious, I crave them all the time. I usually find that one order of XLB per adult usually satisfies everyone, but if you want to order other things, then you can adjust that ratio.
Rice cakes, scallion pancakes and orange chicken (little cringe) are also really good here. 
At some tables, it is community seating, but in my opinion, that's how you get the authentic experience! It's also cash only!",1
best. soup. dumplings. ever. great place...will always come back.,1
"Love this place!! My brother used to live in NY and everytime he goes back to visit, this is the first place he goes! We went for the soup dumplings of course and also had the delish shanghai noodles. The family style seating isn't ideal but it's a small price to pay for the DELICIOUS AMAZING soup dumplings. I wish we had just as good dumplings in LA. Yummmm. I can't wait to go back to NY just to have more of these dumplings :)",1
If you have never tried soup dumplings - this is the place! We ordered 3 orders of pork for the 6 of us with a few other traditional dishes. Living in CT you can not find this delicacy so whenever I am in NY this place is worth the trip.,1
"Went to try what I was told was the best soup dumplings in Chinatown. The dining area was full on a summer week night, so I was hopeful about the hype. Despite the crowd, we were seated immediately at a large table that we shortly thereafter shared with another group of 5 visiting from the UK. We were quickly attended to and served our delicious fare. The soup dumplings were tasty, though it did take a bit longer to receive our order of crab stuffed dumplings than did our neighbors across the table. The supporting dishes were also quite flavorful, especially the minced bean curd and eggplant with garlic sauce. Only one star removed for being a cash only location.",1
"The crab/pork XLB (soup dumplings) from Joe's was probably my favorite thing we ate during our trip to NYC. Definitely a 5 star worthy XLB and the best I had anywhere. The XLB was so juicy and flavorful! The crab essence and flavor was prominent and the meat is tender. The skin of the soup dumplings was not particularly thin but was just right to hold up all the juice inside. Highly recommend the crab/pork XLB**

We also had the green onion pancake and a plate of seasonal veggies. The green onion pancake is different from what I am used to. The ones here are a bit thicker and super crispy. I liked their version just as much as the thin chewy one I am used to. The veggies were decent. Not super oily nor salty. Missing a bit of ""wok-hey.""

The wait wasn't too bad on a Saturday morning. We got a number and waited ~15 minutes to be seated at a shared round table with 3 other parties. I didn't mind sharing the table and liked that they worked pretty efficient to minimize the wait time.

I will definitely make sure to come to Joe's again on my next trip to NYC.",1
"We end up swinging through here every time we are back in NYC.
The dumplings and a must. Also careful technique is a must when eating these tasty but molten hot juicy liquid explosives of pork heaven.

And yeah, service is a bit ""rough around the edges"", as others may point out, and yeah, the ambiance is a bit rough as well, but you're not here for that. And plus, this is New York, this is how we do. ;)",1
"Joe's Shanghai is great! You should expect to have at least a 15 minute wait to be seated but the food comes out pretty quickly especially if you use those 15 minutes wisely and prepare your order!!!!! I unfortunately do not eat pork/sea food so my options were very limited. I want some soup dumplings but they were all made with pork! Too bad. I started with the scallion pancake which was so great!!!!!! I highly recommend them. I finished with the Kung Pao chicken which didn't have too much flavor, I probably wouldn't get it again.",1
"I've been going to Joe's for years and I cant say enough good things. The food is great and the experience even better. Every time my family or friends visit from Europe I take them here and they are super satisfied with the soup dumplings. Please, stop complaining about the service. They help as much as they can, this is a fast paced restaurant managed by very driven Chinese people and yes it is always packed but they always do their best when you ask. 

Enjoy! Eat tons, everything is good!",1
"Service: Happened to be around the area.  Called in advanced to have crab dumplings. Once I arrived food was already prepared waiting for me!!

Ambiance: Tight atmosphere. 

Food: I'm personally spectacle not knowing exactly what I am eating. However, my first but was oddly textured, but delightfully tasty! Although, it wasn't just crabs. The gelatin soup was overbearing.",1
"Do you eat pork? Do you like dumplings? Are you near Chinatown? Yes? Go to Joe's Shanghai, order some pork soup dumplings, and experience bliss. There are better places for Chinese food in NY, so just stick to the dumplings.",1
"It's small, it's busy, it's dirty, but the soup dumplings are worth it. We've been countless times and whenever someone in our group orders anything other than the XLB, they always kinda wish they just had more dumplings. Make sure to use your vinegar and chili sauce, and order a side of scallion pancakes for good measure.",1
"I heart joe's shanghai
if i said it was ""just average""- that'd be a lie
The soup dumplings are delish
it is definitely joe's best dish!

Mmm i love joe's crab and pork soup dumplings. The thought of them make me drool (gross i know, but they're soooo good! haha) i've had the Shanghai Noodles, but I wouldn't recommend the Pan Fried Noodles-- the noodles have a weird texture-- almost  like styrofoam. 

I've have the scallion pancakes-- they're pretty decent too, but it's kinda pricey for just a few slices.",1
"I stumble upon this place while I was visiting NYC. I order some food for to go, and it was some of the most amazing food that I had in NYC.",1
I've been to both locations one in China town and one in midtown. Great food here. The dim sum is really good. I recommend ordering the fried shrimp and the generals tso chicken. You won't be disappointed.,1
"You can honsetly never go wrong with Joes, but I have had better. Food is a tad bit on the oily side, but honestly still very good. Haha. If I'm in chinatown and craving soup dumplings its the only place i`ll go, however there's better soup dumplings in the other boroughs. Hate that there's a long wait at like all times !",1
"Although this place is crowded and they sit you with strangers, I definitely enjoy the xiao lung bao! Perhaps the best one I've had so far. Big and super juicy with thick soup! Just to let you know, you have to get a number if you want to be seated. Then they will call you when they are ready.

I had the xlb, pork buns, wonton soup, noodles ... basically a lot! When I came back to dallas, man, I miss this place! Can't compare at all.will be back!",1
"I don't care how busy it always is ( literally busy from opening to closing everyday!) or how you have to share tables.

The XIAO LONG BAO are bombbbbb!
my all time favourite place to eat when I visit NYC. The soup dumplings are perfectly made, and so delicious and so freaking cheap!


I always wanted to learn their secret recipe of how they can keep all that yummy soup in those thinly and perfectly made dumplings? I am obsessed with these and there is no way I can go to New York without my Joe's Shanghai!

Did I mention they are so cheap too?!!!",1
"I have been going here since I was little, and I still love it. Every time I go, I get the soup dumplings. I recommend the crab and pork soup dumplings over the pork ones. I also like the string beans and beef and broccoli. It is worth the wait!",1
"I was with a party of 12 and while the wait wasn't that long, they require your whole party to be there before they seat you, and they do count! We ordered the Pork Soup Dumplings, Double Cooked Pork, and Peking Duck. The dumplings weren't all they were hyped up to be, but still delicious and larger than expected. The Double Cooked Pork was my favorite dish. It was very spicy but still flavorful. The Peking Duck was surprisingly big! You definitely get what you pay for. Overall the experience a bit of a let down as this location is very hyped up but it was just average in my opinion.",1
"Great place for soup dumplings. Either pork or crab! The place is small, so expect to sit with other people at a table!",1
"Joe Shanghai is probably the best dumpling place I have ever been to in my life I am only 12 years old but you wouldn't believe the places I've been to. In my young life, I have been to Hong Kong and have tasted ""best"" dumplings in the world. The crab dumplings are so good. And the pork dumplings are also spectacular. And to top it off they have soup inside that is just marvelous.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is a definite must for me whenever I visit NYC. I always always always always have to eat here at least once. Why? Because it is delicious! It not only satisfies my hunger but it makes me feel all warm inside! 

At first I was a little afraid to try this place out because not everyone on yelp is accurate since everyone's taste buds are so different. Not only that but there are a few other places where it was just over hyped and it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. On top of that, when a place becomes famous, their quality slowly slides downhill. I can tell you, Joe's Shanghai is none of the above. 

Joe's Shanghai may not be where all the awesome customer service is because come on, stereotypically, Chinese places aren't known for their customer service. Joe's Shanghai, however, is definitely consistent with their quality of their famous xiao long baos or soup dumplings, as most people refer to it as. 

ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS order some xiao long bao/soup dumplings. In fact, that is the first thing they ask you when you sit down. ""You want some dumplings?"" Granted, heavy Chinese accent seeping through their English but it works. I always prefer the pork/original type but they also have a crab/pork one if I remember correctly.

NOTE. When you get these dumplings, they are steaming HOT. Do NOT be that person that puts the whole thing in their mouth the second they get it. DO NOT!! You will burn yourself so bad! Let it cool for a few and I suggest taking a small bite and drinking the soup first. There is SOUP on the inside and it will burn you if you eat it too quickly! ...Yes personal experience :( No I never put the whole thing in my mouth but the soup does burn me...

Be warned. This place is really popular so you most likely have to wait unless you're eating at odd hours like at 3-4 pm. If you go with a party, your party must be all present for them to sit you down. Also, not your typical restaurant. You don't get to have a table all to yourself most of the time -- you'll have to learn how to share. I know it's an odd concept because I don't like sharing my food, let alone my table! But no worries! It'll be fine! It's actually very similar to how they sit people overseas at a dim sum place. Plus that way, they can get people in and out faster. 

Aside from their pork dumplings, I have tried a few other dishes but they weren't as memorable. Teehee. 

Give Joe's Shanghai a try and order the dumplings. You can't go wrong.",1
"Good dim sim food

I think Shanghai you seasoned its food better and had better soup dumplings.

But hey this is solid and hits the spot if your craving soup dumps and noodz",1
"The dumplings were great - definitely lived up to the hype, although I still think the best I've ever had is on Highway 7 in Toronto, Ontario.

The noodle soup were okay. Nothing spectacular.

A bit of a line to get in, but worth the wait to check out.",1
"I absolutely love Joe's Shanghai. Their soup dumplings are amazing, I only eat the crab meat with pork one. It's always so flavorful.

"Absolutely no complaints about this place.. walked in about 7pm with a party of 5 and was seated immediately . Staff was GREAT, very attentive . Food was delicious ..all of it.! You must try these soup dumplings!",1
"Yummy soup dumplings, it's worth the wait.  The rice cakes there are also very good.",1
"5 Stars for the Soup Dumplings! 3 stars for the ambiance / service. It's crowded, you have to share tables, and the service is rushed since they are trying to move people along quickly. Great deal. Worth it. Go... right now.",1
"The food here is flavorful and comes out fast, but the service is lacking. While we were starting to get up they already seated people at our table so we trapped against the wall. We then were repeatedly bumped towards the door even though we didn't have our coats on. 

That being said, we didn't have to wait and were seated as a party of 5 at a shared table immediately at 11:30. We ordered Scallion Pancake, Pork Soup Dumplings, Crispy Shredded Beef, Eggplant, Green Beans, and Shanghai Noodles with chicken. The tea was hot and refilled quickly. The table was set with a soup spoon and small dishes of vinegar waiting for our first order of dumplings.

The beef was sweet and crispy but not chewy like other versions of this dish I've had. What I thought were shredded carrots were bitter pieces or orange peel mixed into the dish. The eggplant had a crisp, blistered skin which yielded to a squishy center but it needed flavor. It tasted solely of the oil it was fried in. Green beans were salty with firm wrinkly skins that snapped with each bite. The Shanghai noodles were almost the size of udon noodles and were very comforting and familiar in a slightly sweet brown gravy sauce.

But the star here is the XLB. The soup dumplings, when plucked from the steamer (I used my fingers since the tongs are more risky) had the perfect mouthful of soup. The broth was flavorful and the dumpling wrapper wasn't too thick. The meat inside was actual dumpling filling, not mystery meat that I've seen ooze out of other dumplings.

Cash only, but not that expensive! There's an ATM right when you walk in.",1
"Just order 8-13 or 14 on the appetizers menu.

This will give you
2 x soup dumplings (different types)
1 x scallion pancakes
1 x cold sesame noodles
1 x fried dumplings

With 3 sodas this dim sum feast for 2 will set you back only $44 dollars including tip, and trust me, it's more than enough food.

Don't expect this to be a romantic dinner though. I went with my fiance and they seated us after a 30 minute wait they seated us at a table with 9 other people. Everyone else finished before us and they started a 4 person cleaning the rest of the table furiously, so we finished our last dumpling and scrammed.

Still a GREAT experience!!

CASH ONLY!!!",1
Went to visit China Town today and this place did. it disappoint. These were truly some really tasty soup dumplings and the beef pancakes were amazing. The worker was also super nice. 10/10,1
"Sunday 9/11, party of two, we were seated immediately at 1:30 p.m.  The restaurant was packed.  

Next to us at the communal table sat two Spanish tourists and I told them, ""This place is known for their dumplings.""  I don't think they understood me but I pointed to items #1 and #2 and they nodded their head.  

At the big table of eight next to us sat eight caucasians, all eating soup dumplings.  Not something I see every day.  

As for us... we kept it simple.  

Crab & Pork Dumplings -  I ordered two trays ($6.95 each, 8 per tray) of these and couldn't finish it all.  On my first tray they even gave me an extra dumpling!  Wasted, such a shame.  At first I couldn't taste the crab, but by the time I got to my fourth dumpling, the crab taste was just bursting out before I even took a bite.  I guess my taste buds just had to get adjusted.  Nice and soupy.  

Pork Dumplings -  $4.95 for tray of 8.  Very good, but a little less flavorful than the dumpling meat that's mixed with crab.  Very reasonably priced.  

Green Onion Pancake - Six pieces, pan fried with just the right crispness.  Mind blowing... no.  Good enough to order again next time?  Definitely.  

A few things for the first timer...

With your chopsticks, pick up the dumpling by the top nub (yes, it looks what your mama nursed you with) and put it onto your plastic soup spoon.  Pick it up gently out of the tray so that you don't puncture or rip the dumpling skin.  If you lose all/any it's juice/soup, that's a fail.

The provided mixed sauce is vinegar, soy, and fresh ginger.  Put some on top of the dumpling that's now sitting in your soup spoon.  The reason you eat it out of the soup spoon is to protect when there is drippage or for when you bite too eagerly into a steaming hot dumpling.  Burn...

Don't be afraid to ask for extra ginger.  The vinegar, soy, and ginger really do bring out the flavor of the dumpling, otherwise, it's pretty plain.  Mix in some ground red pepper if you like it spicy.   

***Why do Chinese people make such a big deal about soup dumplings?***  

It's not that it's China's best food, it's because not every restaurant makes them fresh and a decent soup dumpling is hard to find.  The worst is when you go to a restaurant that has this on the menu and they steam up some grocery store frozen ones for you.",1
"Love the dumplings. ITs just so amazing how much juice it has got. price is also very reasonable. 
The only drawback is the wait time. Man I had to wait like 40mins to get in and they only take cash!!! bummer
If only everyone upgraded to 21st century by accepting digital payments,especially in NY. anyways i guess it is what it is. Will try the flushing location since I heard there is no wait and more parking space.",1
"Amidst all the recent hype about unicorn meat (http://www.thinkgeek.com/caffeine/wacky-edibles/e5a7/), I've always wondered what it would taste like had they made the real thing. 

Picture it. Crab meat soup dumplings from Joe's Shanghai. 2010. Chinese unicorn takes you on a ride - over the oriental rainbow.",1
"So good and always packed. One time they had a C rating and I ate there anyway, it's that good! Ps I didn't get sick or anything.",1
"This may seem like a hole in the wall nestled in China Town but it is THE BEST Chinese food I've ever had. The wait is worth it, the seating allows you an opportunity to meet new people (you may sit at a table with other parties), and the service is quick. I order the sesame chicken, note the broccli comes out cold, they're know for their dumplings and fyi your soda comes in a can. A note was handed out advising the china town location will be moving December 1st so next time I visit I'll be anxious to see the new location.",1
"Every look and bite of their soup dumplings make me regret every time I have ever gone to DTF. 

It's cash only, you get seated with strangers, and the service/attitude will always be at best lukewarm, but that'll be everywhere in Chinatown anywhere so get comfortable with it. Thankfully when we came by on a weekday at 2pm, the wait was minimal. We only ordered the pork & crab soup dumplings and the pork soup dumplings since that's what they are known for, and we had a lot of more eating planned for in NYC. 

These soup dumplings were BIG, about 3 times the size of normal XLBs from DTF or any other Chinese restaurants where I've had them. That got me concerned that the dumplings would be too doughy, but that wasn't the case at all! They had just the right amount of dough, with plenty of flavorful soup and fillings. Even with just 2 orders of the soup dumplings (total of 12 dumplings) got us full. Compared to what I've had from the PNW, these were definitely the best I've had and they were perfect on a cold winter day.",1
"Yes! This is the place for really tasty Shanghai dumplings! 
The dumplings are large and filled with lots of delicious juice. Definitely hand made. 
The scallion pancakes are crispy and delicious, but a tad greasy.
The restaurant was filled with Chinese people with a blend of a few tourists mixed in. 
They accept cash only, but their prices are really reasonable! 
They also add an automatic 15% service charge. 
I recommend this place heartily.",1
"So regardless of my negative reaction from Joe's Shanghai a couple years ago. I decided to take the plunge and risk the being of my digestive system. I was craving for shanghai soup dumplings. I got it for take out and it was ready to go in 15 minutes. I must say, compared to Full House, the quality was much better. I had the crab meat soup dumplings. The wrapping didn't break and it came through after my first bite. Compared with Full House, it has a different taste to it but not a bad taste. Both are good in their own ways but I think I'd prefer Joe's over anywhere else. Definitely trying their wontons next week! Stay tuned!",1
"Absolutely in love with this place. They're super busy so they're customer service is unintentionally ok and not great but it's definitely doable. Of course the soup dumplings are out of this world. This time around we got the sesame chicken as well (among other things) and it turned out to be so so good. Gosh I wish they had a place like this here in DC... Hmmm, do they?!",1
"I can see why this place is so popular. I had first tried it many years ago at their original location in Flushing. This new hub has been open for a while now and there's always a line out the door and down the block. It's popular with tourist and locals alike. I can't say it's my favorite soup dumpling spot, but it's definitely worth a stop. My friends sing praises to the orange beef fish, while I found it too sweet and not sure how I feel about it after the first try. I'll surely come back again as it's one of their faves and update my review. The ambience is relax the attention is active, so it sure is worth a stop.",1
"Felt like years since I last came here. Maybe 2 years lol. Either way it has been so long that I forgot I wasn't a fan of the crab and pork soup dumplings, note to self, stick to pork only. My mother in law has heard about this place from us for years and she tried to make her own soup dumpling but failed. She too liked pork over crab and pork. Until next time Joe!",1
"There was about 40 min wait on a Friday night, which wasn't bad given how many people were waiting outside the restaurant. Pretty crowded space and they seat smaller parties together at large circular tables. The waiter took our order first and the soup dumplings came out pretty quickly while the rest of the table stared at us out of jealousy. The size of the soup dumplings is larger than your average soup dumpling and there is plenty of soup. Compared to ding tai feng, the skin is thicker and the presentation is less delicate overall, but still delicious. My friend and his family are from Shanghai and they think that Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings are better than the ones back home, so that's saying something. Also, eight for the price of $6.25 is a steal. This location is cheaper than the midtown location which is eight for $8.25. Will definitely be coming back for more.",1
We had that dumpling soup and orange beef and hot and sour soup. All was ridiculously good!,1
"While around Chinatown I wanted to try these Pork Dumplings I have kept hearing about!! Well when walking in to get to the table it was pretty busy during lunch hour which just shows that they must be doing something right with all these hungry mouths! The service was very quick, came in ordered the dumpling right away and WOW!!! The flavor was so robust the soup was nice and hot but not mouth scorching, the table had Chili Oil to compliment the Dumplings, which was a nice touch if you are into that kind of thing! Can say I want to go back and try other dumplings and other food they have on their menu, just from seeing other plates that people had around me, I was wanting to try this and that! Thanks for you business!",1
When we arrived there was a line. The hostess gives you a number and you wait to be called. If it's super busy they will seat smaller parties with other people for communal dining like on cruise ships. We had a great family dine with us. The pork and crab soup dumplings (first timer) were so good! The whole experience was a blast.,1
"The soup dumplings alone earns this place five stars. HOW do they pack so much soup into each little dumpling? So delicious and definitely for the ""MUST"" list for the dumpling lovers. I recommend trying both the pork and crab soup dumplings. That said, the crab dumplings are SO good.

I can't wait to go back. 

I've been twice, Saturday for an early lunch and Sunday for a late dinner. Both times the restaurant was packed but the wait pretty reasonable (under 20 minutes). The service is attentive. Cash only and very economical. 

I usually don't like to give reviews for just one dish, but the soup dumplings are SO superior here I couldn't give this place any less stars!",1
"Everything we had was delicious! The soup dumplings, orange chicken (my favorite), kung pao chicken, and beef and broccoli. After finding out about this place in China Town I will make sure I come back and visit every time I'm in New York!",1
This is a cash only place which is ok with me. The food was great. The service was fast and the food was hot. The dumplings were big and delicious. The soup is enough for 2. I definitely enjoyed it.,1
"By far my favorite Chinese restaurant! I crave their soup dumplings all the time. Although they are not known for their service I think that is part of the charm of it. Big group, small group, it's always a fun time. You have to have everyone in your party there before you will get seated and it's cash only. They do include a 15% tip on the check every time. Also, the picture I attached is right when it opened. I have never seen it that empty. We always get dumplings, pan fried noodles, and scallion pancakes. The price is super reasonable as well!",1
"There is ALWAYS a line out the door.  I went on a Sunday at noon and luckily I was seated right away. 

REASONS YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS PLACE:
If you are in a rush, don't like crowded spaces or sharing tables, then you probably won't like this place.  It is a communal setting so we were seated with 2 other couples at a round table but everyone is busy slurping the soup dumplings so you prob won't notice  anyway.

The food is great (and you WILL be full) and it's so cheap for the city ($36 for 3 dishes including tip) so this balances out all the bad stuff 

The soup dumplings are made fresh and are good, but if only going for these, there are other places in Chinatown that serve pork soup dumplings.  (example: shanghai cuisine on Mott St) 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1) soup dumplings 
2) chefs special: shredded spicy beef if you like spice
3) the cabbage wonton soup if you wanna opt for a soup (+add white pepper)
4) bring cash 
5) 15% tip is included in the bill but I gave a few extra dollars",1
"Second time coming here from Philly.  Can't get anything like this back home.  Everyone comes here for the xiao long bao's, which are probably one of the best.  There are two options - crab with pork and pork.  Best to try both and you'll love the juicy buns!",1
"Reliable standby. Avoid the crowds and order for pick up (they don't deliver). Prices have risen considerably since they moved to their new location. Their soup dumplings are as good as ever, and the eggplant and pork is excellent. The Flushing location's kitchen has always been a cut above.",1
A Literal hole in the wall with the best soup dumplings I've ever had in my life. An hour wait and you have no clue why. BUT once you eat there it all makes sense. Soup dumplings are incredible and the other dishes are on point. Highly highly recommend,1
Joe's has moved to their Bowery location and this new location is anything but dirty and smelly! It looks amazing inside and there's plenty of space!,1
"I HAVE NO WORDS!

.

.

Okay, I think I've gathered myself enough. 

This place is amazing! The soup dumplings are out of this WORLD!

Both the crab/pork, and the pork options of the soup dumplings are well worth the try. But the pork ones are simply transcendent. Absolutely divine. How on earth do they pack so much flavour into them??

By recommendation of our table mates, a family of 4 seated with is, we also tried the prawns in meat sauce, and the scallion pancakes. These too, were delicious.

But those soup dumplings. C'mon.",1
"We came for the soup dumplings and were not disappointed! I didn't know what to expect and was a little worried about the wait time when I saw the large crowd waiting as you first walk in. 
They only have large round tables - seat about 10 people each - at which you are seated according to available space. We were seated immediately which was great. However, you end up staring across the table at strangers. 
The food was good - kept to the basics. I enjoyed the beef and broccoli and the pork soup dumplings. The sesame chicken was ok.",1
"Best Asian food i have ever had. Ive tried din tai fung in LA and must say that this place tastes much better! 

I had the dumpling soup and it was really good. The vinegar soy sauce just went amazing with just about everything i had.

Overall its a great spot, we love this place and will definitely come back soon!",1
"After reading the rave reviews about this place I headed there and it did not disappoint! Everything that was brought to the table was absolute perfection. The soup dumplings were probably the best I've had (now the bar is so high) and the rest of the dishes were all perfectly seasoned and so authentic. We ordered the sauteed flat noodles which were so yummy and long! We also ordered fried rice, wonton soup and Beef and green beans. Portions of noodles and rice were great to share but I wish there was more of the beef as it was amazing. There was a long line but we only waited for about 15 mins or so. This is now a place I will come back to everytime I'm in the area.",1
Good place for xiaolongbao. I feel like their xiaolongbao is bigger than others. Clean and bright environment. Good service. The food comes very fast.,1
"I have often been quoted as saying that nothing can compare to the Joe's Shanghai of my youth.  Indeed there is something awsomely authentic about the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai.  Much more expensive higher end versions have sprung up all over the country, but still cannot compare to the original.  The Young Chow fried rice, the Singapore curry mai fun, shanghai noodles, been curd szechuan, and many other dishes are special works of joy here.  When Joe's Shanghai catapulted into everyone's consciousness in the 1980's, Shanghai cuisine was certainly a novelty.  I hope Joe's Shanghai stays around for another generation.  With the coming of the New Chinatown these older establishments where you are forced to eat with strangers, and your waitors and waitresses have a real New York attitude are indeed refreshing.  It is true that you can never go back, but there are certainly legendary NYC Chinatown establishments that hopefully will go on forever!",1
The taste is much incredible. It is amazing to find this spot. The steam bun met the expectation. Be careful do not break it when you move it into your dish.,1
Came here once with my cousin and it is legitimately the best soup dumpling I've ever had. Can't wait till I'm back in New York to eat the yummy crab dumpling again!!! I recommend anyone who's in town to give it a go for sure!,1
"As soon as we seated, they immediately asked if we wanted their soup dumplings. It's like they know you came here FOR their soup dumpling and that's 100% correct (we did). 

We had the pork and it was delish- definitely will be back to try their other foods. People next to us ordered pan fried noodle and it looked good!

P.S- be careful when you eat them, they are HOT and filled with soup! I usually bit a little hole then drink the soup then eat the dumpling.",1
"This place is a little hidden gem of soup dumpling delights!  We were greeted with a very busy dining room but were able to be seated within 5-10 minutes and were immediately given a pot of light tea to start with (particularly lovely on colder days.)  We ordered two steam trays of soup dumplings that smelled so amazing my vegetarian friend even partook in the items!! Helpful hint: make sure to puncture the dumpling directly over your spoon so you don't lose any of the broth and also so the steam can escape (otherwise be prepared to scald half of your taste buds.) We also had the eggplant which were good, although I'd prefer a bit more spice to be added to the dish.  I recommend going with a group so you can sample a large portion of the menu but beware, this hole in the wall is cash only!",1
"This restaurant was highly recommended by previous visitors and we were well advised!   We went mid afternoon, which I would recommend...about 2:30 pm -4:00 pm. No wait, seated with others at a community table which made for great chit chat.  We ordered the soup dumplings, fried rice and General Tso's chicken.   Very authentic, flavors very true and worthy of the praise.  They only take cash, no credit cards, so be prepared.   Pricing is reasonable, so that makes it easy.  The service is very rote, but friendly.",1
"Came here with the fiancé and his family! The line was so long have to waited an hour for it but guess what?! All worth it! The dumplings taste so good better than other dumpling places I've gone to. Not only do the dumplings taste delicious, their soups as well.",1
"I wanted to hate this place because the wait was supposed to only be 45 minutes (lies, all lies) but it ended up being over an hour, it's cash only, tip is included and the waiters act like it is, AND they got a C health inspection grade.

BUT...the food was amazing and very reasonably priced.  The crab and pork dumplings were juicy and delicious and not fishy tasting at all.  The shanghai noodles w/ beef were also great.  Everything we ordered was either good or great.  I would go back again, but hopefully when it is less busy and cleaner.",1
"I know this place is a tourist trap, but the soup dumplings here were pretty darn good. When the dumplings came out, they look like they had been flattened since there was so much soup inside of them. Be careful, as always, when you bite into one since it literally explodes with hot soup. We ordered both the pork (original) and crab dumplings, but I must say that the pork ones were simply better than the crab ones. The crab ones tasted strangely fibrous and were not as juicy as the pork ones.

Joe's Shanghai is CASH ONLY so make sure you have enough before you decide to dine here. Since this place is a tourist trap, expect to wait in line for a bit before making it inside. Another thing to note is that there is communal seating--different parties will all be seated together at the same round table (we had three groups sharing one large table). I've experienced communal seating before, but never at a round table. Since everyone is able to see everyone else, it is a little bit of a strange experience...but most people will be so focused on eating their soup dumplings so it all turns out okay.",1
"Joe's Shanghai took my xiao long bao virginity.

I had never even heard of xiao long bao previous to attending college in New York (SoCal represent!), but one of my friends took me here since she frequents this place.

After hearing rave reviews from my friends about this mysterious dumpling, I had high expectations for trying xiao long bao.

My expectations were exceeded. The second I bit into its soft folds, my LIFE CHANGED. Seriously. It was like heaven exploding in my mouth. Coupled with the vinegar/ginger sauce, it was amazing.

So although I'm no xiao long bao connoisseur, I can definitely recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Delicious! Obviously soup dumplings, but the eggplant with pork is delicious too!  Perfect amount of food for two hungry girls.  Family style is fun too :)",1
"If you are ever wondering why the streets of Chinatown are pretty empty on a Friday night it's because everyone is HERE. 

Word on the street is that their soup dumplings are comparable to Din Tai Fung and a guy next to us even mentioned their soup dumplings were spot on to the ones he had in Shanghai! 

You walk in and this place is PACKED. I mean like the hostess is giving out tickets for parties to wait to be called on type stuff. Luckily, if you are only a party of two or an alone dumpling enthusiast  you will definitely not be waiting for long. 

My boyfriend and I stumbled into this place and got seated right away. It seemed like the host was leading us back to the kitchen but little did we know  they sit multiple parties to one big round Chinese dinner tables! While this could definitely be awkward for some people and not the best option for a first date, we ended up having a fun time with the other dumpling lovers around us. It was almost refreshing to share awkward smiles and the appreciation of good dumplings. 

On to the dumplings! So we ordered the soup and regular pan fried dumplings. The broth was one of the best I've ever had and the pan fried  ones were so crisp to a T. 

Will be back soon!",1
"Joe's Shanghai is my go-to spot to take people visiting the NYC area, and I always bring them to this location specifically.  You can't go wrong with any of the soup dumplings, but I'd also recommend the orange beef and the crispy beef. Portions are great.

If you have a smaller party, you may wind up having to sit family style with another small party, which you can either see as a bad thing or an opportunity to make friends. Warning: Joe's is CASH ONLY so keep that in mind when you're coming in.",1
"The Classic. Always delicious dumplings. Hit or miss on the soft shell crab, which was oily, gritty and had the wrong texture. Otherwise-this place is always delicious:)",1
"Went with three people and we ordered soup dumplings, beef and broccoli, scallion pancakes, sea bass, and an eggplant dish.

Garlic eggplant was delicious as was the beef and broccoli. 

Totally worth the wait!",1
"The best soup dumplings around. I would recommend Joe's to anyone visiting the area. Great atmosphere but beware, cash only!",1
"My favorite place for soup dumplings and scallion pancake in chinatown. Although it's busy most of the time and packed with tourists and people think it's hyped up, I still really like this place. You'll most likely be seated with a group of strangers unless you have a big enough group to fit one whole table. Also be on the look out for celebrity sitings. They have pictures of celebrities who have dined there on the walls. I even sat right across from jake gyllenhaal once too!",1
"Came here with friends for dinner for our NYC trip!

Thankfully, we came RIGHT before the extreme wait. They told us it would be ~20 minutes, we only waited 5 minutes! Woo hoo :)

The service was super quick, they took our order swiftly, and our food came out quick! I was impressed bc it was so DANG busy that night (the line was out the door). The restaurant was very crowded, but that's what happens there are a lot of customers.

We got the pork soup dumplings. Super. Savory. and. Delicious. The soup was extremely rich and- of course- sizzling hot! We also got other entrees/dishes which were just as good (pork+bean curd? and the pancake appetizer), but the soup dumplings are 10/10 and probably the only dish I can remember and left a mark.

I would come back here for lunch if I ever come back in the area! Definitely recommend coming here with friends/family for a nice hot meal :)",1
"incredible soup dumpz, aka my little friends, oh god woooOWOoOWOOWO

they are just so perfect, not oily, freshly made, delicate little dough pockets filled with flavorful warm broth

damnit I wish I could have a pillow made out of this I would have the sweetest little dumpling dreams ever.",1
Excellent service and the crispy beef is to die for. Just remember to bring cash as that is all they accept,1
"so i went in a group of 4 and we got seated on a huge table with a bunch of other people. i was real hesitant about this place because what if someone steals our food on the lazy susan?!!?!? i tend to hate stuff when people claim best ever like here when everyone told....BEST XIAO LONG BAO'S EVER. we got a bunch of those(my first time having them) and some curry noodles and some other non-memorable stuff.

the XLB's for sure lived up to the hype. actually they went beyond the hype if you can believe it. like avatar. but that's a different story. hahaha

i've had XLB's from various places in california like din tai fung or hole in the wall places up in san francisco, but joe's knocks them all out of the juicy sauce. get it? like knock them out of the water? but instead of water, juicy sauce??!!?!? 

wakka wakka wakka",1
"Literally came here twice during our trip to New York. Everything we ordered was soooo goooood! 
Both times we came, we ordered the pork meat soup dumplings and young chow fried rice. I can say those were our top favorite dishes. The pork meat soup dumplings are HUGE, not your typical size soup dumpling (this is a must get!!). Also, the fried rice may look bland but it's packed with flavor!

The Szechuan beef noodle soup was okay. It needed more flavor as it was a bit bland. The crispy shredded beef was good. Tasted almost like sweet and sour pork. Also, the scallion pancakes are worth trying!

The food came out pretty quick which was good for us because both times we came, we were all starving!! 

Service was decent. They were super quick at getting us whatever we needed like extra bowls, napkins, water, etc. 

Not sure if it was just a one time thing or we just missed it, but we noticed there was already a 18% or 20% service charge on our bill (the second time we came). The first time we came and paid, we didn't notice the service charge included in the bill so we might have double tipped them. So just make sure to check the bill before paying so you're not over tipping! 

FYI, they only accept cash! They have an ATM right in front of the entrance in case you don't have enough cash on hand.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is delicious perfection of soup dumplings. Why you would order anything else is beyond me. If you are looking for great non-soup dumplings, try Vanessa's or Prosperity you fools!

On to the dumplings! A steaming hot perfect crab soup dumpling will put you in heaven, especially in the winter! (though I've had Joe's in the humid heavy heat of NY in July and they were still amazing). 

Order the CRAB dumplings over the simple pork. Even if you don't love pure crab, there's something about the crab flavor that creates a rich meatiness in the dumpling broth!

NOTES: There are shared tables (yes, you may sit next to a stranger) and you WILL have to speak up if you need something (extra sauce, etc).",1
Good soup dumplings. Be prepared for long lines but worth it.,1
"Good New York Chinese. Soup dumplings are great, as is the American Chinese fare (sesame chicken). Pan fried dumplings were okay, not amazing. Service is typical. Expect a wait to be seated, but grab a drink at the park restaurant/bar next door.",1
Yummy for my tummy... soup dumplings made of... crab and pork... so good... in my tummy... scallion pancake... great as an... appetizer... my thoughts... floating about with dreams of yumminess... the crab paste peeking out... the soup bursting out of the dumpling in my mouth... me so full... me so happy... me like the joe shanghai tshirt on the wall but when I go to buy one all they have are polo shirts that would make me look like a manager at joe shanghai so i... pass... so yummy in my tummy... me like joe shanghai.,1
"Ok if you like authentic dumplings, this is the place for you.  It is a bit off the beaten path and they accept cash only, but the dumplings are worth it.  Really everything we had was fantastic.  The shrimp and beef dishes were very tasty go just before noon and beat the rush.  Note that small parties me be seated with other groups.",1
The best XLB's I've ever had in the U.S.   Much better than the overrated Din Tai Fung.  Slightly cheaper than average XLB prices.,1
"What's up with the 'C' grade?

Food was tasty and plentiful. However, the 'C' grade prevented me from fully embracing.",1
"This review is really for the XLB. No place on the west coast comes close to this. Definitely worth the wait, if there is one. After eating here, any other restaurant that serves XLB just doesn't even come close in taste, with the exception of Din Tai Fung.",1
"Get here early, and get BOTH crab and pork dumplings. They are awesome. You just have to wait for them because of the line. I also liked how the seating works, you may end up eating next to people you dont know. So the conversations over the food were interesting and fun.

Back to the dumplings. Ive never had anything like them. Bite off the top and suck out the soup, then eat it? Sounds good to me! They are so flavorful and once you add their sauce they give you, dumpling goodness!

Also the tip is included in the check. But since the meal will be around 15 bucks, i wouldnt complain.",1
"When I go to Chinatown with a group or just me and my wife this is the place we usually end up.  Excellent dumplings, scallion pancakes are also great if a little on the oily side.  Everyone always has their staple ""go to"" Chinese dish and I am willing to bet this place will not let you down.  There is usually a wait but it moves quickly as every seat in the place is used, as is the norm in most Chinese Restaurants of similar style.  So get in line sit down and meet some new people for a change!",1
"i went here because a friend told me of this place, i went in and it was kinda busy, i was sat away at a table. i was by myself so it was kind of awkward. i ordered the scallion pancake and the pork dumplings. both were really delicious. i lost my money and they were nice enough to tell me where an atm was and let me go get that money. i'd go back here.",1
Ordered the pork soup dumplings and was thoroughly satisfied!  The soup was so delicious and nothing like I've ever tasted before!  Definitely a place to try if you're craving good dumplings.,1
"Definitely the best Xai Long Bao in NYC! Easy to find, lots of seating, fasat service, and delicious food- everything I need. Note- if is cash only so come prepared or take the hit at the ATM in the front, either way it's totally worth it!",1
"Soup. INSIDE. a pork dumpling.  its so good so make sure you order more than 1 order.  the dumpling sits in the spoon, bite the tip, suck the soup, eat the dumpling.  add the sauce to taste",1
"Best soup dumplings ever. Also loved the lo mein.

There is always a line but it's definitely worth the wait! Very reasonably priced too!",1
"Only reviewing the XLB.

$6 for eight insanely delicious soup dumplings. 

By the way, people get way too crazy about analyzing every aspect of XLB, but I just sat back and enjoyed and it was awesome. Everything was balanced in my opinion, maybe a little light on actual pork meat but whatever. I loved it. 

I think they were better here than Din Tai Fung....",1
"Great soup dumplings. 
Surprising well cooked, juicy and large white meat chicken in the general tsao.",1
"Came here for lunch on a Wed. No waiting at all when we arrived a little past noon. Servers were attentive and efficient. My order:
Soup dumplings: probably one of the best I've ever had. 5+ stars
Pot stickers: nice crunch with good portion filling. 5 stars
Shanghai thick noodle: not bad but could've used a little more flavor. 4 stars
String beans: great flavor but mushy, 3.5 stars 
Crispy spring roll: it was a bit mushy. I didn't enjoy it that much. 3 stars. 
Since there isn't a half star rating, I give it 5 stars because their soup dumplings are amazing.",1
"Delicious! 

I recently traveled to Taiwan, where I fell in love with  Xiao Long Bao's at Din Tai Fung. After searching yelp for the best XLB in Manhattan, I decided on Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown. We ordered the scallion pancake and two orders of the pork XLB (it's pork buns on the menu). They were both fantastic! Personally, I prefer Korean scallion pancakes (pajeon) but these were excellent in their own way. The XLB was so good! Not quite as good as Din Tai Fung, but very delicious.",1
Chive pancakes and eggplant & pork in spicy garlic sauce to die for!!!!!,1
"We stopped by here after the Lubar Festival parade. Waited 30 minutes for a table to our selves, as they wanted to seat us at a group table. 

We weren't offered the free tea mentioned in other reviews.  We ordered both soup dumplings listed as appetizers: the pork and the pork/crab.  They were amazing and filling!  We also ordered the Shanghai noodle that a lot of others on Yelp have raved about, but we thought they were just ""good"".",1
Loved this food and experience. So NY Chinatown! Better food than in Vancouver and Singapore. They don't take reservations. You will probably sit with other customers at a large table. So fun and memorable. Go hungry! Totally reasonable prices. Yummy! Add Joe's Shanghai to your must do list of NYC!,1
BEST Soup dumplings eveeeeeeeeeeeer ! The price is pretty good too ^_^. The noodles and rest of there food that they serve are pretty decent. Well this spot is known for soup dumplings anyways. It cost about $5 for 8 soup dumplings. Def worth the money. MUST TRY IT !!! (:,1
"So the soup dumplings are amazing. I can't find another place in California that would make them at the way Joe has them.

Okay okay...Din Tai Fung...whatever. The dumplings are tiny, but they will do until my next trip to NY.

Other items to try:

Crispy Beef and Broccoli - My second favorite dish (1st are the dumplings). Just try it. Its the sauce.

Pork Shoulder - If you a lil daring and you have a few calories to spare, try it. Its great! The sauce, the meat (or whatever meat you find amongst the fat and skin) on a bed of steamed spinach is delicious.",1
As a lover of chinese food I had to stop in this place after reading all of the reviews and I was not disappointed. We ordered the Chicken lo mein and the General Tso's Chicken and loved every bit of it.,1
"i am a lover of shanghai cuisine. while i am not a huge fan of sharing a table with random strangers, i will make an exception for joe's shanghai (at least i will for the one on Pell). after having ordered the soup dumplings from the midtown location via seamlessweb on many a weeknight evening over the past several months, i finally returned to the mothership for a very tasty/oily meal with my family and roommate. after a 35 min wait, we were seated, and the feasting began. we went with an order each of the pork and crabmeat soup dumplings, and then followed up with a seafood feast consisting of scallion & ginger soft shell crabs, sauteed shrimp, eel casserole, seaweed battered oysters and chinese mushrooms w/chinese vegetable (yes, the myseterious vegetable vaguely named, chinese vegetable). every dish was wonderfully tasty and equally oily. reminded me of being in shanghai, except nyc chinatown is slightly dirtier, smellier, and in general, there are more non-chinese people in the general vicinity than shanghai.",1
"Place was PACKED at 5pm, which is always a great sign. Dumplings were outstanding, lo-mein was great ... chow-mein was not worth it and should be skipped. Go for the dumplings tho! Awesome.",1
"The only downfall of this place was the wait. Came here on a Sunday night around 915 and we were told the wait would be about 20/30 minutes but we waited about 45/50 minutes. We were put at a table with 4 strangers so it was a little uncomfortable. We ordered both pork and crab dumplings. The crab was good but I prefer pork, unfortunately all the pork ones were stuck to the lettuce beneath them and as I tried to pick them up they all ripped, each and every one. We also ordered shrimp fried rice which was delicious and the Kung pao chicken was even better and mixed together it was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Everything was good and cheap, I'll definitely be back even though I know there will be a wait.",1
"If you love soup dumplings, you won't find a better place to get them. Absolutely DELICIOUS and soup-y each and every time. My boyfriend and I always get crab/pork soup dumplings, fried rice cake, and scallion pancakes. Everything else on the menu looks appetizing as well. 

Do not come here if you're looking for an intimate setting. You will almost never get a table to yourself if you're only a party of 2/3. I can almost guarantee that you'd be placed at a table with other guests. It COULD be awkward especially if you're joining a very large party. I would also not recommend coming here for dinner time if you want to be seated quickly. You will probably wait about 30 min...but it's well worth it!",1
"This is a popular restaurant with tourists so expect long queue.

It is located close to the Canal and Bowery St intersection.

The food and service were good.",1
"oh boy oh boy oh boy i finally get to try Joe's Shanghai after being tortured by Doriee D for YEARS with her constant rambling and pictures ! 

We came here for break...brun.. yeah BRUNCH on a Wednesday morning. Our plan was to arrive right at opening right at 11am but due to some subway maintenance and leaving a little later than we had expected, we got here around 1130A instead. To my surprise and joy, it was still fairly empty. We had gotten our table for 6 in the middle of the restaurant almost instantly. 

Since I have been deprived of XLB for so long on top of being tortured year after year, i decided to YOLO (like with a lot of other things on my trip in NYC) and order 2 Pork XLB (Pork Steamed Bun) and 1 Crab with pork XLB (Crab Meat with Pork Meat Steamed Bun). Normally, 3 orders would be fairly easy for me in any other store. I had underestimated the size of these dumplings and how FATTY and RICH the soup instead the dumplings where. Oh also each order is 8 dumplings... 

For those who don't know what XLB (Xiao Long Bao) are... they are dumplings with ""soup"" inside. To go into more detail about that, they make a congealed form of soup with the cartilagenous parts of teh pig, chill it, and mix it with the seasoned meat mixture. When steamed, the gel melts creating ""soup"" within the dumpling. 

If you have NEVER had XLB, please be careful when eating it. The skin/wrap is really thin so try not to break it when picking it up. Also, the soup is EXTREMELY hot. So either nick a hole and pour it out into your spoon or just YOLO it and burn your tongue (so worth it) Lol 

Back to my underestimation of this dumpling. Size wise, they are probably 50% larger than my usual XLB i get in LA (no not Ding Tai Fung). Its a small family owned place ive been going to for like 20 years. The ""soup""... oh man ITS SO FREAKING FATTY AND RICH... after i ate 1 order, i was half way through the 2nd.. i was like oh man.. i NEED some hot tea to help this broth go down. This has NEVER happened to me. I literally had to ask the waiter for a fresh batch of hot tea. 

Unfortunately ! it being my first meal of the day ... and it being so rich and heavy... i couldn't finish all 3 orders :( i ate 21 of 24 pieces. I mean still pretty good, but one of my fail YOLO experiences ... BUT IT WAS SOO GOOD ! Wrapper was nice and thin but not over steamed and lost its ""chewy"" texture. The meat was soft and flavorful with its as mentioned many times already FATTY, HEAVY, RICH soup.. 

Oh we also ordered a Shanghai Fried Flat Noodle (tho technically ive never seen it called flat noodle... in chinese, its called Shanghai Fried THICK noodle so it confused my friend when i had suggested that to my friend. This is one of my 3 staple items i almost HAVE TO order every time i go to a shanghai place. XLB, shanghai style thick noodles, and shanghai style rice cake. Those 3 items had satisfied me for years every time i went to my fav place in LA. Their version is like most with veggies, slices of pork, and lots of noodles. Flavored well and made really well. Color is a nice deep color. So yummy! 

HIGHLY recommended place to eat and try if you are in NYC's chinatown or just NYC in general. Worth the trip. Prices are REALLY good. Normal Pork XLB was 6.25 for 8.. Crab one was 8.50 i think. REALLY good pricing in comparison to other places ive been to when even a normal XLB was in the 8s..",1
"A party of 5 visited this place on Saturday evening. The place was busy but managed to get a seat immediately. Ordered crab pork soup dumplings (super), vegetable dumplings (good), scallion pancake (not impressed), veg fried rice (good in taste but less quantity), pan fried noodles with chicken (liked it) and fish in Szechuan sauce (liked it as well). Service was quick, moderate-high priced, good experience.",1
"Food was good but I wouldn't say is worth the hype, the xiaolongbao was definitely the best thing. If you're doing weekend lunch make sure to come before noon or you'll be waiting for a while",1
"Quality: Over averaged
Taste: excellent
Price: Very cheap
Service: don't expect much.
Reservation is a must especially for dinner. I waited for almost 45 minutes. The waiting area was tiny. Only 4-5 people could stand indoor area. The rest had to wait outside and it was windy and freezing. We were arranged to sit with other people sharing the same 10-seat table.",1
"My friend decided to tour a group of us around the city and took us to Joe's Shanghai.  The boys got there first and had already started waiting.  That place is busy.  After about a 25 minute wait, we were ready to be seated.

Entering the restaurant, every table had at least one basket of Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao).  We were seated at half of a large table in the back.  The other half was occupied by a family.  This was the first time that I've had to share tables in the US.  But, if the food is good, I think it's worth it.

So, by popular demand, we ordered the dumplings.  We also ordered some green beans, kung pao chicken, and rice (you know, if we got tired of the dumplings and wanted standard Chinese American fare).  

When the dumplings came out, I was excited to show my friends how to eat them.  I used the tongs to grab the dumpling by the top and moved them to my soup spoon.  Then, I took a small bite and steam from the soup came out.  I could barely wait to devour my dumpling before I remembered--the vinegar and ginger!  Added that and began tasting.  It was the best Shanghai dumplings I've had in awhile and certainly, in the United States.

The green beans were good too--greasy, but if you're Chinese, you know that you need the grease and the hot wok to make food taste that good.  Mmmm.

Otherwise, the service was horrible.  The waiters were really rude and abrupt, throwing things at your table or walking away before really listening to what you wanted.  But, it's great food, which means they have the right to be rude. . .right?",1
"I live in the area, and pretty much on any given weekend I can see a long line just spilling out of Joe's Shanghai and onto the Chinatown streets. If you can manage, come on a weekday for lunch. You'll rarely find a line then, and even if you have to wait, it won't be long. 5-10 min tops.

Joe's Shanghai has a full menu, and you can get pretty much anything you'd expect from a restaurant serving Chinese fare. However, the star of the restaurant is the Xiao Long Bao, the soup dumpling, which appears as the first two items on the appetizers menu. Everything else is fluff (albeit, tasty fluff).

I'll usually get one or two orders of the crab soup dumplings and an order Shanghai fried rice. Shared between two people, this seems to be more than enough food, and it is plenty cheap~! 

Other than that, it's a pretty no-frills place, service is meh (but you aren't here for that, you're here for soup dumplings, remember?), and the decor is nothing special. Oh, but the walls ARE plastered with photos of celebrities that have been to the restaurant, posing with the owner. Is anyone familiar with the ancient meme, ""Prancing Cera""? Well, there's a picture of Michael Cera in there wearing the same exact outfit he had as Prancing Cera, leading me to believe that the two were taken on the same day.

Anyway, look for that picture if you're a Cera fan.",1
"This place should be 5 stars. The xiao long bao here is as good as the street vendors in shanghai. Lots of soup inside the dumpling, which is the authentic way to do it. The pork is the best but the shrimp is also ok. I've been here every time I'm in NYC, which is about 7-8 times in the past couple of years. There might be a line outside since the place is really popular. I haven't been to any of their other locations but this one is enough to satisfy my cravings. One more thing, the seating is combined tables, so you'll probably be seated with strangers unless you are in a big group of 7-8 people. Check this place out!",1
"Come here for the soupy dumplings and do not leave until you have had one full basket. Otherwise you will sorely regret not having had your fill the next day. It is that good, and certainly worth the wait. These dumplings are by far the best. Don't be hasty in biting into the dumplings, as they are really hot and, if attacked too ravenously, will spew its hot liquid soupy insides all over the unsuspected amateur. Note that you have been well warned.

Other dishes worthy of note are the stir fried rice cakes, stir fried shanghainese noodles, and kow fu (soy sauce flavored wheat gluten). The dry sauteed string beans are also tasty and well executed (not over cooked).",1
"I hate waiting for anything, I really do. But Joe's Shanghai always suckers me in. Soup dumplings are always hot/fresh and it's just so good. I've never had a problem with the staff rushing my groups out, even when it's slammed. Servers do often need some repetitive reminders that I ordered this dish, or that dish, but I've never had a problem otherwise.",1
"Soup dumplings to die for.  I remember a blur of a meal with 15+ people scarfing down food after one of those Seaport shows, but there remains searing image burned into my gustatory retina of those killer soup dumplings.  Slow-mo of (cue 70's porn music bow-chika-bow-wow): biting off the chewy dough of the top, slurping brothy goodness, spooning in dipping sauce and the revelatory goodness of that meaty center.  Swoon.",1
"BEST SOUP DUMPLINGS (Xiao Loong Bao) IN NYC!! Everything else is average. I personally love the crab meat soup dumplings more than the regular pork one. When you're here, please say hi to my mom Elaine (the cashier) :)",1
"Soup dumplings were really amazing. But pork pan fried noodles was just ok and beef with scallions was not tasty. I would come back for the dumplings and to try hot and sour soup and beef with peppers (it looked very good on the other table). 

Environment is messy, if you are just 2-4 people you will probably share table with others. 

Service was ok, very quick but waiter didn't speak English well and was pretty rude.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is all about one thing - 'Xiao Long Bao', also known as 'Soup Dumpling', and they have 1 main pork based version, and 1 crab (seafoody) version! The particular thing about this particular outlet is that its always tooooo crowded, very touristy and you have to always-always wait in the line to get in! I like the other mid-town location for my own reasons..but definitely you gotta come here!",1
"Joe's Shanghai is a good place if you want XLB, soup dumplings and other northern Chinese food. The XLB is savory and flavorful with a chewy outer layer, a lot thicker than Ding Tai Fung XLB if that's what you're used to. Shanghai fried noodles come in big portions at a decent price about $8. The drunken chicken might be a little too drunk for my taste, but the it is flavorful as well.

The service is efficient here. Servers are attentive and bring out the food in a timely manner. The only issue I have with this place is the cash only policy. It's inconvenient because the food is priced more than the normal amount of cash a person would carry. Other than that, this place is a decent Chinese food joint.",1
"Lost in New York, we yelped a possible dinner stop before going home. Stellar reviews drew us in, hunger urged us on. The pictures of all the celebrities visiting on the wall made us stay. Still out palettes can be finicky. We ordered the mu shu pork, the house special fried rice and the shrimp in lobster sauce. All were delectable. The rice - flavorful without being overpowering, the shrimp was large and tasty, and the mushu was too much for us, but we had to eat some more. Due to the confusion of our taste buds, i forgot the soup dumplings. These were exquisite. The soup was flavorful and had enough oil to make it surface while eating the meat part. Needless to say, we enjoyed our meal. Albeit it can be a little confusing to find it ( dont confuse it with joe's ginger on the same street), it is though well worth the find.

P.S.
Cash only! 2 atms available on the main st.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is wildly popular in Chinatown. It's in a great location and can commonly be found with groups of people waiting outside for their names to be called. I am a huge lover of xiao long bao, so I was looking forward to trying them out. We went in for a later lunch and were seated right away. Despite the odd time, it was still packed. 

We ordered the wonton soup and xiao long bao. Honestly, the wontons were almost as juicy as the soup dumplings, so it felt like we were eating two variations of the same dish. Both were phenomenal. The xiao long bao was flavorful, filled with a tasty broth and had great ratios of meat to soup to wrapper. They were relatively large compared to others I've had in the past, so it's amazing that they still tasted so good. 

This place deserves the praise. It has an endless menu, which I imagine has many good things from what I could tell from the two things we tried. The staff was friendly and came by a couple times to check in, but they definitely move quickly throughout the dining room. I'm very excited to go back one day to try out so more items, but xiao long baos will always be a staple in my order.",1
"Pork dumplings made the meal, I could have satisfied myself with these alone. We got here as soon as it opened at 11 to avoid the rush and not even 15 minutes later the place was packed. It is clearly one of the better restaurants in Chinatown, a great choice to experience the area.",1
"Ugh I go back on fourth on who's soup dumplings reign supreme between here and nom wah. Of late, I'm thinking Joe's might be edging ahead. 

Usually has a wait at peak times. Staff are efficient though not overly helpful or friendly. Often times you end up at a table with other people. 

The food is just wonderful though and well priced. I always get both the pork and crab/pork soup dumplings. Their Lions Head is delicious! Super soft meat balls in a delicious salty sauce with baby boc choy. Yum.  Also recommend the shanghai fried rice. 

The eggplant is delicious but would only get with a big group as the portion is huge. The string beans are tasty but very very salty. 

Overall they could come down on the salt but at the end of the day I will definitely be back (and again and again and again). Their soup dumplings are incredible. I've been to the other locations and they simply aren't as good as this one.",1
The BEST Chinese food hands down! Look no further. What more better than Chinese food in Chinatown. FYI Only cash is accepted here.,1
The General Tso Chicken is THE best. -Not exaggerating what so ever. The green beans are really good. The chicken fried rice is strong. The pork soup dumplings are really good. Always a very busy restaurant. No reservations can be made. Service is fast. CASH ONLY.,1
Crab Shiao Long Bao and Scallion/Green Onion Pancake are the way to go here.,1
"Finally stopped by this place after an event at a nearby university with some friends and had a pleasant experience. We came by around 10:20 not knowing that they close at 11:00 and the service was impeccably fast and delicious. For a party of 7 we got four orders of soup dumplings, pork fried rice, spicy noodles, and a crispy pork dish. And before we knew it we ended up clearing the table just as 11 hit. Only reason I'm giving this spot 4 stars is because the bathrooms were super nasty and kind of made me question how sanitary their kitchen was",1
"I tried many restaurants in my recent week in NYC.  This is one of three that stand out so well that I wish to write reviews (the other two are the very upscale Le Bernardin in Manhattan and then Juliana's pizza shop in Brooklyn).

This place's xiao long bao dumplings are wonderful and not something I know how to find in Indiana, where I live.  We were a party of two, showing up late on a mid-weekday.  The place had a horde of waiting customers outside even though several other restaurants on the block had open seats and no crowds.  After a 20 minute wait, we were seated at a big roundtable with two other parties.   The foods were great, the service hopping and efficient, and the experience a delight.",1
"Waiting time: 15 minutes. Not that bad.

Ordered their pork steamed bun and beef noodle. It was awesome, although we need to wait yet another 15-20 minutes. I knew it took so long due to the hectic conditions inside the restaurant. (servers were pretty much overwhelmed with orders and bills). Oh, and don't forget that Joe's Shanghai only accept CASH. Would give a 5 if they accept credits though.",1
"Love their shao Lim bao, Shangai pan fried noodles and sauteyed string bean dish.  Been a happy patron for 7 years and I keep coming back.  Check out their ginger ale film Brooklyn.  It's memorable!",1
"The best place to eat chinese food in NY, you have to try the shangai noodles. The place is really famous and we had to wait 40 min to get in for a table, but it was worth it.",1
Came here just for the soup dumplings. I'm not a soup dumpling expert but these were delicious. Make sure you know how to eat them properly before you try them!,1
Best Xiao Long Bao in New York.  I highly recommend.,1
"We were surprised to be sitting at a family style table with a rotating middle portion but I have no problem sitting with other people just be aware if you hate people or something. There was no wait for us but the place was full of people, the waiters work quickly to get you in and out. The dumplings are legit and the rest of the food is very good too. Complimentary green tea as well.",1
"During our trip to NYC, my friends and I really wanted to eat here! I'll warn you that the wait was long, the restaurant is small so there isn't a good spot to sit while you're waiting. We got seated after about 30-40 minutes, but we had to share a table with a couple, who just about finished their food and was replaced by another couple. We actually had a good conversation with this other couple who were also traveling so I guess there's a silver lining to that.

It's been a while since I've been here, but I do remember that their dumplings were good! To me, ​they're better than Din Tai Fung, but it wasn't better than the ones from Shanghai Asian Manor. We also had the Shanghai flat noodles, beef braised soup, and rice. The couple sitting with us offered some of their scallion pancakes and that was actually really delicious and crispy!

Service was good and the prices were reasonable. If I ever came to NYC again (jk I will) I would definitely come back here.",1
"Shanghai dumpling 
#9 - crab and pork
#10 - pork

The wait was at least 1 hr.  Was it worth the wait? It's definitely a place to try.  

What makes a good dumpling is the thin skin perfectly sealed to trap the soup. Joe's Shanghai dumplings contains soup, BUT the thickness of the skin overwhelmed the meat and soup inside.

I prefer small sized dumplings that has equal amounts of skin, meat, and soup. Joe's dumplings was a little too large that what you're eating is mostly skin and soup. Why not order noodle soup then??",1
"Some of the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. Worth the 40 minute wait on a Sunday night. I had been dying for decent scallion pancakes for ages, and these did not disappoint. 5 people, after tip, $82. We had sesame chicken, szechuan beef, and shrimp lo mein, along with a bunch of appys. A must try!",1
"Food was really good however service not so good at all. They also add automatic 15% tip to your bill, so to them they don't really care how your experience is. Amazing food though just maybe next time I do take our instead.",1
This place rocks.  Still the best around!  And their staff is very attentive.  Price is super affordable.,1
"Dumplings are my all time favorite food, and I consider dumplings to be their own food group. These are *some of the best xiao long baos (soup dumplings)* I've ever had. Upon planning to visit NYC, a couple friends, and friends of friends, recommended I come here. While eating, I overheard a group at another table saying they were from over seas, and they made a point to come to Joe's to get their fix. I've concluded, this place is the dumpling destination in NYC...one might even say pilgrimage. With that said, I don't think there's much to say that hasn't already been said about Joe's. An unassuming name, but wildly delicious and reasonably priced. 

TIPS
+ Order the xiao long baos (note: the soup is super rich and leans towards the fatty side). 
+ Cash only! 
+Be prepared to wait.
+ Seating is family style so you will likely be seated next to other parties.",1
"There always seems to be a line of people waiting to get in.  They'll give you a number for the wait and when you finally do get your table, you'll have to share it with complete strangers.  If you don't mind this, then the food is actually quite good.  

I recommend the sesame beef  entree and the black mushroom and bamboo shoot entree.   

Atmosphere is definitely casual.  They don't bring you glasses for the sodas.  The food was quick and the service was very good.  I would like to go back, but will do some research to determine when it's less crowded so I don't have to share a table with a family from Georgia.",1
We stopped here because of all of the great reviews and it did not disappoint. The pro dumplings were out of this world good! I would come back for those alone. We also enjoyed the general tso's chicken and they can adjust the spice to your taste which is nice. Everything was really good. The restaurant is crowded but they get you seated quickly. Only thing to note is it's cash only so bring some with you to avoid the ATM fees.,1
"Ahhh! My 100th review must go to Joe's Shanghai. Love this place always, last time I came here was pre-pandemic at the Flushing location and been meaning to come here for a while. There's usually a line, so I usually just opt for another soup dumpling place in the area, but nothing beats Joe's Shanghai. The soup dumplings are perfect, the pea shoots are delicious, the chicken is perfect, and the mapodofu was great as well! I recommend everything- you can't go wrong with their extensive menu. The inside ambience is super nice and modern inside and service is quick. My mom and I did decide to wait and I'm so glad we did!",1
"Oh the spooks of Halloween night in NYC. The crappy rainy weather as we watch goblins, clowns, and super heroes trotting along in the rainy weather. 

Great for 30minutes, but now this demon and her friend are cold and hungry. Where do we venture to before heading to the next scary Halloween event! HINT: Joe's Shanghai. 

Nothing hits the spot like puncturing a hole in the delicious dumpling and having the broth pour into your spoon as you sip the soup. Then eating the dumplings. 

Also its always entertaining to watch friends eat it for the first time and burn their mouths on the dumpling since they don't know any better and chomp on it right off the bat. 

Seating is a pain unless part of big party (so hopefully you are popular) if not enjoy sitting with strangers. 

Note: when someone doesn't tip its because the restaurant automatically adds 15% gratuity. For those who gave my friend and me the dirty look, learn to read!",1
"The Shanghai Noodle Soup was really, really good, made with a rich  soy base, thick udon noodles, greens and thin slices of pork and ginger. The soup dumplings were plump, soupy and flavorful, not at all greasy. Service was efficient and friendly at lunch time. The bathroom was acceptably clean.  Cash only. Line stretches down the block on Fri. and Sat. night.",1
Best soup dumplings period. Get ready to wait in line.,1
"I've been hearing people talk this place up for awhile now so I was glad to finally swing by!

Party of two on Saturday at 11am, no wait, they'll seat you at a large table them fill it with other patrons as they stroll in.

We ordered their crab and pork xlb and their pork xlb. Crab and pork was the better of the two, mainly cuz the meat had a nicer, juicier texture to it. 

Otherwise these are huge in size, they're overflowing your soup spoon! Tons of soup in every one too!

Make sure to bring cash as they dont take card, and make sure to come hungry.",1
"wow, their dumplings are DELICIOUS!!  A definite must if you are in the NYC Chinatown area on vaca. I've yet to find dumplings like this back home in San Jose, but i'll keep my eyes peeled.",1
"I absolutely love this place! The only reason I am giving it four stars is because their most famous dish (soup dumplings) are a little too oily and salty, in my opinion. I'm not sure if it was just the serving that I got but it the soup inside tasted too thick and oily, although it was still delicious but not amazing. I ordered their other dishes also, including their beef noodles and scallion pancakes (a must!). Their noodles are very flavorful and they put a lot of meat in the dish like they don't scam you. I suggest if you are having the soup dumplings, you can get the noodles and scallion pancake to share. 

The place is good for large parties as they have tables that can seat up to 8 people, however, the wait time during peak times can be about an hour so just keep that in mind. Smaller tables tend to clear up faster.",1
"Love Joe's Shanghai. Been to the midtown and flushing location multiple times, and this was actually my first trip to this one. 

The food is just as good as the other locations. I am always amazed at just how delicious the soup dumplings are every time I get the opportunity to eat them. While the soup dumplings are the main event, their twice cooked pork is also the best I've ever had.

One small complaint. There's always a wait at all their locations. However, what I've appreciated in the past was relatively accurate wait times. For example, when they say a half hour, the wait is somewhat close to a half hour. At this location, this is not the case. We were told 20 minutes (which seemed impossible given the crowd), and it turned out to be well over an hour. If they had told us an hour from the start, we gladly would have waited, but it was a little frustrating seeing the clock tick way past 20 minutes. 

Also we were a party of 4, and were seated at a 6 top with another party. Not a big deal, but was a little unexpected.

Overall though - this place is the real deal. You come for the food and not much else, and the food absolutely exceeds the hype. I cannot recommend Joe's enough to anyone looking for a delicious Chinese food experience.",1
"We were seated right away, but the place was packed! We enjoyed sitting with others in this atmosphere and seeing what others had ordered before us. Wound up with the soup steamed dumplings (delicious), pan fried noodles and beef (best ever), and chicken and vegetables (good, but would not order again). People sitting next to us we're raving about the crispy shredded beef. Go and enjoy!!",1
"Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The menu was extensive and I'm sure there is a dish for everyone! Located in the heart of Chinatown, you don't want to miss this stop. Do note that this place is CASH ONLY before going:)

 Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings ($9.95) // Succulent, juicy, and full of crab flavor! Loved these and they were the best soup dumplings I've ever had. 
 Pork Meat Soup Dumplings ($7.95) // Loved these as well! A classic done perfectly. 
 Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (w Pork) (12.95) // Phenomenal. The eggplant was soft and coated in the sticky garlic sauce. Loved the flavors and textures of this dish. 
 Sautéed String Bean (w Minced Pork) ($12.95) // Have to get your veggies in!! Light and crunchy dish to balance the rest of the meal out.",1
amazing!! their soup dumplings are amazing. we came here for brunch and absolutely loved it.,1
"Soup dumplings, cold noodles sesame paste. Got here right at opening 11- already hopping. Don't think you can go wrong with anything on menu.",1
"The BEST SOUP DUMPLINGS in New York is at Joe's Shanghai. 

We had to wait about 40 minutes but it was well worth the wait! 

They really don't waste any table space, let me tell you that! Be ready to share your round table with strangers! But luckily the strangers we sat next to were so nice! My boyfriend was HANGRY and starving and this lovely lady next to him could totally TELL... LOL and so she even offered her dumplings to my boyfriend to curb his appetite before we got our food, and in turn we offered her some of our food when it came out as well. 

I had two of the cute personal sakes. It's lid is actually the shot glass! How convenient is that!

We had like 3 orders of the XLB or Xiao Long Bao (SO GOOD, SO STEAMY, SO JUICY) 

I really do miss them already and can't wait to come back here on my next New York Trip!",1
"Jackpot! Finally... A hyped up place that did not disappoint. Had 6:00 reservations with a dozen of my coworkers. We were seated immediately, with only half of us there, no questioned asked, no pressure or rush to get orders in while everyone else arrived. 

We ordered a ton of food. Really, it might have been an actual metric ton. 

Pork soup dumplings (5 orders) - I won't say they were the best soup dumplings I've ever had, but they sure were tasty. Nothing bad to say. 

Shrimp and meat dumplings (10 orders) - not overly fishy at all, nice and tasty. Fan of these too. 

Squid with veggies and jalapeños (2 orders) - really nice dish. Pleasant spice with big chunks of squid. 

Kung pao chicken - some of the best Kung pao I've had anywhere. Juicy and spicy and a little crispy. 

Minced sautéed squid and pork with jalapeño (2 orders) - love this. Mixed and chopped bits of deliciousness with some spice. 

Crispy pork chop wit salt and pepper (2 orders) - not really Szechuan, but not to say it wasn't really good. It's a fried pork chop, so be wary of the bones. 

String beans with Szechuan sauce - nice spicy and tasty string beans. If you really feel like you need something green, this is the way to go. 

Shanghai fried flat noodle (2 orders) - great noodle dish. Think of giant Lo mien noodles made of spongey pasta. 

Probably 50 Tsing Tao's. 

I can honestly say there was not a single dish I wouldn't recommend; everything was fantastic. Service was attentive and I never felt rushed to order or to leave. 

Best part... Total after tax and tip came to under $40 per person. Really just  a great experience over all, and I will be back!",1
"BOMB. Like... the best asian food I have ever had.  Soul dumplings, scallion pancakes, shanghai noodles and some beef dish - all insane. Everything they brought out looked amazing too, the fried chicken, all the typical chinese dishes (sesame chicken, chilli chicken, etc) and this full fish dish that looked and smelled incredible. Quickly turned into one of our favorite spots in the city!",1
"Love their XLB. I am a very picky XLB eater. After coming back from Shanghai, my XLB standards have rly rocketed. But I am a fan of Joe's. Both the pork and crab ones are good. Don't bother with the other dishes. We tried their double cooked pork. Disaster. XLB only here. New location is very nice. No longer the ratchet Chinese restaurant where you need to share tables with strangers.",1
"[Joe's Shanghai] Chinese restaurant known famously for their Xiao Long Bao. They used to have multiple locations however after COVID I think they only have one location

There is quite literally nothing better than this restaurant. I could live off this for the rest of my life. I have been to this restaurant over 20+ times now. Every time I'm in NY I have to make a stop. 

Always go for their XLB. They have 2 kinds: pork or pork & crab meat. Personally, I like the pork alone. I usually don't order off the rest of the menu however this one time I did. 

Steamed chicken w Scallions and ginger sauce 
Clams in black bean sauce 
Chinese spinach 

I know some individuals are going to comment about rude service but they have to understand that it's an authentic Chinese restaurant. They're not there to be nice, they're there to make sure you get your food and everyone is fed in and out the door. Also, rudeness is sometime a good indicator if you know a Chinese restaurant is good . Ambiance is super busy. Everytime I have been. 

Overall, 10/10. You can not go wrong with the soup dumplings. Could care less about the rest of the menu.

"We came here specifically for the soup dumplings and hands down, probably one of the best I've had yet. Thankfully, we came right before the rush so there was no wait. Be sure to come right before 12, because after that, It gets pretty packed. The only weird thing was we were seated at a circular table with a couple already there, so it was a little awkward staring across from us. 

The first thing the server asked was ""would you like to order soup dumplings first?"" So it was obvious that this was their specialty! We wanted a light brunch so we ordered two orders of Xiao long bao, one pork and another crab, as well as scallion pancakes. 

I personally enjoyed the crab more, but both with very good. Steamed on a bed of cabbage, which played as a nice accent and addition to the meal. The soup within the dumplings were plentiful, filled my whole spoon. It was rich and savory, perfect on a cold day, and the meat was well seasoned. The scallion pancakes were nice and crisp but were a bit on the oily side. 

I'm definitely going to come back for these soup dumplings next time I'm in NY!",1
"My friends and I got here on a weekday and the place was pretty empty. Somehow, the guy was still angry at us for not knowing what we wanted the moment we sat down. Ehh... that didn't bother me too much, but just warning some people who are extremely sensitive to waiters who like to rush patrons. (I find it to be a sign of authenticity for Asian food.)

Now to the food!
- Soup dumplings: This is my first time trying soup dumplings so I honestly have NO frame of reference for these delicious bombs of boiling fire. However, they were amazing. Gotta love the simplicity of soup broth inside a thin, delicate dumpling wrapper. It's like a reverse noodle soup. YUM.

Seriously, that's all we ordered and were happy. Be careful when eating these things because they will seriously burn your tongue, lips, throat, etc. if you aren't careful. Then you would be too numb to enjoy it! Bite into the side to let some steam out, then sip it slowly, then eat it once you feel ready.

This is a dumpling of patience, and you shall be rewarded greatly.",1
Best soup dumplings in all NYC. Can't rate the rest of their food because that's all we have when we go,1
"Delicious soupy buns....i only come for the soupy dumpling...i literally sit down and order 2 orders of the crab kind, slurp it up and leave.  The rest of the menu is just okay...really nothing to sing about.  there are so many shanghai places in c-town that I only like one thing from each.  this place has the best soupy dumplings.  
don't go to the one uptown...they use the frozen dumplings there..not worth the price or convenience.  
Cons:  no credit cards, hoevering waiters...weird.",1
"Soup dumplings soup dumplings soup dumplings. Everything else (except the brusque service) is really good, but...soup dumplings soup dumplings soup dumplings.",1
"Love it!!! Dumplings are awesome!!
Shredded beef was great, spring rolls great.. shrimp fried rice great!",1
"4.5 stars!

So this place was extremely hyped up by all the west coasters I know so I wanted to know how legit this place actually is...

After having some good Shanghai dumplings in Japan (close to Shanghai, but not close enough), the crab and pork ones remain to be AMAZING! The crab and pork ones are SO much better than the regular pork ones (FACT). The crab really makes it! I honestly went at some weird time so I didn't wait long at all!",1
"I heard a lot about this place and when my husband and I visited NY, I told him we HAD to come here. We were here back around Halloween (I know it's a late review) and were seated rather quickly. We did show our vaccination cards because it was required, I'm not sure about now. I ordered the pork soup dumplings and crab meat dumplings. My husband ordered Kung pao chicken or something like that since he's not a fan of authentic Chinese dining, which sucks for him because he's missing out. Anyway the food was SO good, even the kung pao chicken. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Customer service was 10/10, food was 10/10. I HIGHLY recommend this place!",1
"Best dumplings, beer and customer service sucks though.  This rating is for the Chinatown location.",1
The soup dumplings are the bomb! Went a second time and got the beef and broccoli. Very fresh and the service is good.,1
"Excellent food, worth the wait. Clearly, among the best Chinese food in the city.
I highly advise getting the soup dumplings. Don't order to much because it's easy to be enticed by all the amazing dishes",1
"THE BEST PORK DUMPLINGS IN THE WORLD!! Steamy and soupy when you bite into it, so you must eat it with a soup spoon! That's all you have to order there. That's all I remember eating there even though I'm sure we ordered a lot of other things. It's always packed and you have to share a table unless your group is perfectly a party of 10. This place is on the map for a reason! We still dream about it!!",1
"Best (or at least second best) xiaolongbao in all of NYC!

Terrific scallion pancakes, as well --- just PERFECT.

#topratecustomerserviceaswell",1
"We came specially for the crabmeat soup dumplings. They were delicious. Sharing the round table with someone else is a bit different for us but maybe this is norm here since the restaurant is small.

Warning, cash only.",1
"I absolutely love Joe's. It is on the expensive side for Chinese food, but the quality is fantastic and the portions are large. 

I highly recommend their pork dumplings and if you're a fried rice person you can easily turn an order into 4-6 servings. 

Most entrees I have had are the standard style of Chinese food you see in the US, just a better tasting, higher-quality, version. 

It's also worth mentioning that I've never had a bad delivery experience from here.",1
The soup dumplings are simply the best! They are so delicious and authentic. I crave them on a weekly basis. The service is also spectacular. Servers are kind and accommodating.,1
"Best scallion pancake I've ever had was from here. I find myself always coming back for that reason! Of course the soup dumplings are great and well as the beef noodle soup. The prices are great as this is cash only. I think the one on upper east side prices are more expensive. This is the original location and you can definitely feel the authenticity. One thing I will say is that the service is okay, they don't really give you water unless you ask which isn't a huge deal for me but sometimes they forget even if you ask! Lol. The restaurant is a shared table restaurant which means most of the time you'll have to sit at a table with other people, so if you're not into that sort of thing just be mindful when you come here. They do have two people tables but only about 4 of them. Taking off a star for not offering srirachua sauce though",1
"Yum yum yum!  These are by far the BEST soup dumplings I ever had.  Big, plump, flavorful, and most of all juicy!  So juicy that you have to be careful when you first bite into it.  I accidentally bit into mine the wrong way and the soup squirted into my hair (i have long hair).   I suspect that a lot of grease must be inside the dumplings though because when the liquid that got into my hair dried up, my hair became stiff as a board. But, don't worry, the dumplings don't taste greasy or anything. 
I ordered a shrimp dish (i forget which one) but even that was so good!
I had to wait in a line that went out the door, but it was worth it.",1
Definitely the best soup dumplings that I've had in the city. The atmosphere is definitely casual and friendly - you'll definitely be seated with another party. I recommend the pork and crab soup dumplings. They were so soupy and so flavorful. Also had the best scallion pancakes I've ever had A perfectly crispy. Will definitely be back.,1
"visited nyc last weekend and came here for the famous soup dumplings...and man were they yummy! i ordered the pork dumplings, the carb and pork dumplings, and the scallion pancake (super yummy too!). that filled me up so i couldn't try any of their regular menu items..hence only 4 stars. also, the service could have been better (after asking the waiter 3 times for a straw i had the bf just get up and get one for me). we came here on a monday morning and it wasn't packed at all. now im back in SD and craving those dumplings!!",1
Best dumplings around! And all the dishes were excellent too. Somewhat of a wait but definitely worth it!!,1
"Juicy pork buns are one of my favorite dishes and Joe's is the perfect place to get them! The buns are consistently made with a thin skin and filled with oily delicious juice. You must have them if you stop by here. I've tried other dishes here, and they're pretty standard. I'd recommend stopping by here for a snack, and then heading elsewhere for a real meal. Come early or late because the restaurant gets crowded around lunch hour! Cash only!",1
"I think this place is great for XLB (soup dumplings).  It's not a hype.  In fact, I think this is better than the Famous Taiwanese Branch Ding Tai Fung known for the XLB (Soup dumplings) .  

I don't think every dish at this place is a sensation, so you do have to know what to get here.   XLB (soup dumplings) sure can't go wrong here.   The scallion pancakes are not bad, because they almost fried the outside of it.   Normally scallion pancakes are a lot drier than what they make here.  How can it go wrong if you fry it?     Got the shrimp noodle dish and I think that is a waste of money.  If the one noodle soup based dish isn't good, I am sure the rest of them won't be good here either.  The soup base lacked flavor and bland; not a good choice for this place.   

Didn't get to try their pan fried dumplings because the dish never came and they charged us.   When I told them we never got that dish, they were nice enough to take it off the bill.  Seriously... where did the pan fried dumplings go?     Unfortunately, I never got the try it.   I hope it tasted bad, otherwise I missed out on awesome dumplings.  boo!

So they charged us 15% service fee and is included on the bill.  I don't actually like it when people do that, because I think its rude to ask for specific tip.  A tip is a tip, and it shouldn't be set for you how much you should tip.   

When it gets busy, you have to share a table like it is in HK.",1
"Such a long wait, not sure if its worth because I was afraid it was overrated. I got the pork soup dumplings which was much better than I expected. The dumpling skin was dying and didn't break that easily. My main dish (shanghai noodle soup) was not so good because it was very oily, I know I won't be getting fat noodle soup anymore. Maybe the dry dish would have been better and if I had someone to share it with.

The scallion pancakes were also pretty good.",1
"when i first moved here 5 years ago, i came here on a rainy sunday afternoon and thought the soup dumplings were the best thing i'd ever tasted. i also have an admittedly weird love/hate relationship with burning my tongue (no joke), so i loved the boiling hot soup inside.

however, on subsequent visits i felt like while the price kept rising, the food quality kept diminishing. when tina c. wanted  to come here again i inwardly groaned, but decided i'd give it another shot. aaaand...

this place got better! the soup dumplings were just as good as the first time i had them, and the other dishes we had were all great! it's still unheard of to spend $15 per person on a family style meal in chinatown that doesn't contain seafood, but i was happy overall. in addition to 3 orders of soup dumplings we had the braised pork shoulder (VERY fatty),  orange beef, spinach, and a noodle dish that i really need to get the name of because it was EXCELLENT (my friends did the ordering). 

it's so nice when places exceed your expectations :)",1
"I went for the first time maybe 4 years and I remember that they were the best soup dumplings ever. I finally went back to revisit and I think it's a newly renovated location. The indoor seating looks more modern and nicely decorated. 

The soup dumplings are huge and extremely filling! Double the size of din tai fung. they are the best when consumed while hot. I really enjoyed the pork dumplings but I wasn't a big fan of their crab and pork dumplings. I wish I got to try more of their food but i was already too full from the dumplings. Definitely a must visit if you're looking for a good soup dumpling place .",1
"Dare I say I liked the XLBs here better than Din Tai Fung's?? (please don't shoot me... and I mean only the DTF in Cali). They are bigger than your average soup dumplings at Joe's, but that's not why I liked them. The quality of the meat, soup and skin was noticeable. And their scallion pancake is a must order! I didn't try anything else here, but there really is no need... those two things are where it's at. The only reason why I docked a star is because I hate the whole communal seating idea. It is really awkward to be sitting at a table with a bunch of people you don't know. Luckily the people at our table when we went were cool, but I can imagine if you come here often you'll find yourself stuck in an awkward situation at some point, especially if you come solo!",1
"The soul dumplings here are delicious!! Best I have ever had in my life. The scallion pancakes are great as well. It is a popular restaurant, so do not come Friday night expecting to get a table right away.",1
"Everything about this place makes me not want to come back. It's a tourist trap. On weekends, it's impossible to get a seat and the line is out the door, usually as a cluster.  During the weekdays, even during off hours like 3PM, there's still a line. And you can't ever sit at your own table, it's always shared with strangers.  

OTHER than that, I guess the Xiao Long Baos are decent. They are large and fat, and always look deflated.  Don't use the tongs please, unless you plan on losing all the soup (actually more like pork fat and residual protein) in the steamer rack.

Cash only. And good luck getting in.",1
"Despite the downsides (shared tables, chinatown type service, being a little touristy), I still give this place 5 stars for the food which happens to be AWESOME.  loved the crab dumplings, which i expected to love.  also loved the pan-fried noodles, which I only expected to like.",1
best chinese food in the whole usa !!! the pork soup dumplings are a must and are better than any other place i've had. and i've had a LOT of chinese food and dumplings in my life. i will always return to joes whenever i go to NYC. the place is always busy but the move pretty fast so the wait isn't super long,1
"This is the third stop of our food tour as I have heard so much about this place from my east coast peeps. 

My main purpose is to try their XLB. So, we ordered the crab XLB and standard pork XLB for the four of us. Hubby wants to try their smoked fish, but they said they ran out. So, he ordered the salted duck.  I think it's way too salty. But my hubby likes it. 

Onto to the XLB. The skin is much thicker than I thought. However, it is a very juicy XLB.  I am the only one who likes the crab one. Rest of the table prefer the standard pork one. Kiddos think the crab one tasted funky - whatever that means. 

Servers are ok.  I wouldn't say they are friendly. They are more indifference.  Overall, I would say it's 3.5 stars.  I have rounded it up to 4 stars as it's pricing is ok.  Remember it's cash only!!",1
"Yummy Xiao Long Bao, but other menu items were just mediocre. I know there's a lot of hype around this place, even at 10pm when the place closes at 11pm. The 3 of us ordered 2 orders of XLB, one original and one with crab, an order of fried rice, and string beans. I preferred the regular pork XLB's because there was too much going on in the crab ones, but both were tasty and extremely juicy. They are the most soupy XLB's I've ever had and the thickness of the exterior was pretty good. The only problem with that is it makes the XLB's really hot so be careful!

These XLB's do not even come close to comparing to Din Tai Fung, though they're pretty good.",1
"One of my favorite soup dumplings I've ever had. A bit touristy and crowded, but it's so yum and even the kiddos like it.",1
"Absolutely delicious. Got the soup dumplings with crab meat- holy moly, bursts of magical goodness into your mouth & the pork fried rice- good but not as fantastic as the soup dumplings. Was busy, waited about 10 minutes or so, not bad. Cash only. Service was decent. Did feel slightly rushed, but I guess that's what happens when people are waiting.",1
"One of the best soup dumplings you will eat on the east coast!!! It's always a fun and delicious experience when you come to joe's. First, you have to go inside and tell the person with the clipboard how many people are in your party, and grab a ticket that has your number on it. Then you wait outside for your number to be called. Be aware that waits can be extremely long especially for a big party at peak time! Then you go inside, and if you have a small group, you will most likely sit with random people, which makes things fun and interesting! I always order the scallion pancakes and pork soup dumplings. They are legit so amazing, I don't even bother to get anything else on the menu.",1
"Yum yum yum. Delicious XLBs to satisfy on a rainy night.

The crab and pork XLB were soft and tender, and the soup was perfect. They came out steaming hot, and were a perfect pairing with the dry fried green beans we had. We also had the green onion pancake which was plentiful and devoured quickly.

The wait wasn't too bad, we put our names down and went across the street to get foot massages (at Foot Heaven!). By the time we were done and relaxed, it was time for us to be seated.

The restaurant is cramped, but you don't mind when you're stuffing your face full of tender soup dumplings.",1
"You have to try it at least once. Think what you want about the food after you have tried it, but don't base your decision on coming here off of the ratings. That's my gift of advice to anyone reading these reviews who has not been here yet contemplating if they should go.  Some say it's the best food ever and others think it's overrated so really you can't put a stamp on it. Also, bring cash whenever you do decide to come here. No credit cards!

BUT, I will walk you through the experience. 

First off, everyone always says you can tell how authentic a place is by its customers. Well, the crowd here is always extremely diverse. Not only do I always see a family from an asian country, but there are people who have traveled from all over the world as well. There was a man that I met there once who lives in California (grew up in NY) and he told me that every time he comes to visit he makes sure to stop at Joe's before he goes back to Cali. So, that should tell you something right there.... 

In regards to the wait it really just depends on the time of day you are going. If you show up at 7PM or later you are definitely going to be waiting on a long line. I was actually in the area last night around 10PM and saw my precious Joe's Shanghai with a longggggg line! It's actually a really nice thing to see. It'll be a sad day when I don't see a line there -- the apocalypse will be coming for sure. 

If you're not in a large party you will mostly likely be seated with other people. The place is cramped with large round tables, and some small on the side. So get ready to meet some new people! 

There is a crazy amount of service staff everywhere. You can't really tell the difference between waiters and hostesses. You'll also probably be serviced by multiple people for multiple things so if you need anything don't wait for the person you think is ""your waiter"" because you kind of don't have one. 

You will feel rushed when ordering. They will automatically assume you want the soup dumplings as well. Seriously, that's the first thing you will be asked ""pork or crab?"" CAREFUL CAREFUL CAREFUL when you eat them because they are delicate here, but the skin is thicker than other places :). They also stick to the cabbage for some reason? I've only recently encountered this problem with them here, but I still enjoy the soup dumplings regardless. Oh, and the amount of soup in these dumplings is just amazing! It exceeds the amount of space you have in your spoon! This is where I learned how to eat them so Joe's holds a special soft spot in my tummy. So sentimental! 

You'll be brought tea. Not ice water. So if you want it you'll have to ask for it.... And ask for it as soon as your waiter asks you about those soup dumpling orders ;). 

The food portions are HUGE. I mean... HUGEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! Don't even think about eating a dish by yourself you're going to share and you will be full off of the second plate even if you are sharing with other people. 

Seriously, the pace of the restaurant is so fast but don't let the staff make you feel rushed to eat. Eat at YOUR pace and enjoy it. You waited, and everyone else has to wait too! 

They add tip to the bill so DON'T TIP! I doubt they changed it. 

TL;DR
You have to do it at least once, probably will experience a long wait and be seated with people you don't know, portions are huge, service is speedy, don't add tip, MOST WILL AGREE THE FOOD IS AMAZING INCLUDING ME but you need to use your judgement on that one.  

ENJOY :D!!",1
"I really think the dumplings are just ok.  Not as great as other people make it seem.  I went again hoping I'll taste a difference!

But this time I ordered other items.  And true story, the scallion pancakes are the best I had too.  I thought they were better than the dumplings, but my friends disagreed, thus the four stars!

The eggplants are really good but really greasy.  
their other food is pretty good! I don't know why people don't write about them!

cash only, wait is going to be for awhile and you'll end up sitting with strangers.  oh yeah don't even THINK of receiving good customer service.",1
"GET THE PORK SHOULDER. you have to. I get it every time and everyone always looks at it and starts drooling. If I am feeling nice, i will offer to those drooling bystanders. It's a big shoulder (bone in) with a thick brown sauce on a bed of spinach for those that want some green stuff.

Braised tofu is good too.. kind of like a todo version of the pork shoulder.

authentic? i don't know but it's real good!",1
"BEST ""fresh & salted pork with bamboo shoot soup"" in NYC or probably in East coast! They take time/ 40 min  to prep/ cook this soup, compared to other places' almost instant- ready versions, even look at the color of soup, you will know the difference!",1
"I was wandering around the area and I stumbled across Joe's. Looked up the yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. Service was prompt and friendly. Restaurant appeared clean, table setup was nice and ambience was what you'd expect. It was just myself so I stuck with one appetizer. The waitstaff recommended the soup dumplings. They were delicious!! Go and check this place out. 
Tip is already added to your check when they bring you the bill.

Overall, prompt service, clean restaurant, good atmosphere and great food!",1
"I want to cry when I think of this place. All I can say is GO THERE. 

The pork soup dumplings make my groins ache for New York City. I. NEED. THIS PLACE. Thank god for Chinatown. 

The green beans are flash-cooked in super-hot oil, making them wrinkly, weird-looking, and over-the-top tasty.

GO. THERE. NOW.",1
"Whenever I pass by here, there's always a long line. Decided to just take it to go to see what the hypes about. 
I ordered the pork meat soup dumplings and I was impressed. The skin was slightly chewy and thin.  The meat was tender and packed with soup. Simply delicious.",1
"this is one of my favorite restaurants in new york. 

i love it because they serve great pork and crab soup dumplings along with regular food (not dim sum like ding tai fung in LA). although i think ding tai fung has better soup dumplings... this place is great because of the variety and everything for the most part is really good. be sure to get the scallion pancakes... it's probably the best i've had. 

if you want to avoid waiting... there's a location in flushing which is much bigger.",1
"Some of the best Chinese food I've had in NYC.  My favorite thing from here would be the shanghai soup dumplings.  It's impossible to not want to order tray after tray of the scrumptious, mouth-watering dumplings.  Whether you order the pork or the crabmeat (get this one) dumplings, they are both awesome and guaranteed to satiate your taste-buds... as long as you're a carnivore.  Their noodle dishes are also pretty awesome, but when I think of Joe's Shanghai, all I want are their soup dumplings.

The wait can be a bit of a nightmare and because they are always so busy, service can be a bit slow or rushed- but for the food, totally worth it.

I need to go back to nyc.. yum.",1
I had a great experience here.  Found them on yelp and just so happened to be really popular.  Always expect a wait but it is so much worth it and if you have a small party you will be sharing a table with another small party.  A little awkward but it's all part of the experience.  My favorite of the two soup dumpling was the crab.  We will definitely be coming back again.  Let's see how this one compares to San Francisco dumplings.,1
"Love the soup dumplings. Not used to sharing a table with strangers but it makes the experience even better as you can share more! The service was quick.
The bathroom was gross!",1
"Best soup dumplings I have ever has in the city!!! We two ordered some sesame noodle, 2 box of soup dumplings, and we were so full that couldn't finish them all. Eventually it only cost us like less than 30 bucks! The cheapest(but super yummy) restaurant experience I have ever had in the city! 
Def will come back.",1
The best crab soup dumplings I've had including in Hong Kong   Great scallion pancakes too,1
"Joe's Shanghai has long had a place in my heart, ever since I was first brought here with my Chinese class. It's place was solidified when I recently had my birthday dinner there. We started as a party of 8 and soon grew to 16. The staff just kept adding chairs and bringing more cold beers. Our waiter kept pace with our growing party and appetites. The food was delicious, plentiful and cooked to perfection. We ate until we couldn't eat any more. And then we ate some more. The total bill was very reasonable, around $20 each.

The best part came at the end of the meal. The entire waitstaff brought out a plate of cupcakes (that my friends brought) ablaze with candles and sang out Happy Birthday. And when I say sang, I really mean more like screamed, at top volume. With the entire restaurant chiming in. It couldn't have been a more perfect ending to the meal.

They only lose one star because it is a hectic place, and you do sometimes have to wait.",1
"My friend took me here for my birthday because 

1) she claimed they had the best soup dumplings in the city
and 
2) i had to have noodles, it was my birthday after all.

To say this place was tiny, is an understatement.  But it's NY!! what do you expect.  We were seated at a larger table with two other parties. (so that was a first for me) I laughed a bit because I started to think ""damn, they really know how to utilize space!""  
We ordered 2 orders of the dumplings, 1 pork and 1 crab, and a house chow mein.  Both were delicious and in the end the bill was only $22 for the two of us!!! 
There was another thing I was confused on, and maybe someone out there in Yelp land can help me...... why do they pour tea on the table before they clean it?!?!",1
"If you're looking for a relaxing, quiet meal, this is not the place to go. Chinese restaurants are not known for their service (which can be off putting for people who don't understand that); rather, Chinese restaurants they are known for delivering quick and efficient service. Joe's Shanghai is no exception to this rule. Guests sit at communal tables with other parties, which I personally don't mind. It's interesting to interact with all the tourists who are confused at what they're supposed to order and  how they're supposed to eat what they've ordered. 

Joe's Shanghai delivers quality food. The xiao long bao soup dumplings do not disappoint. I would definitely pick the pork ones over the crab ones, not just because the pork ones are cheaper, but because the the pork ones taste better. We also got green beans which were cooked to just the right crunchiness.
 
I love this place, but allot time in your schedule to wait for a seat! It is crowded most of the time with waits of at least 20 minutes.",1
"you cannot ever go wrong with these dumplings. Grade A delicious. My only thing about this place is the food is not always consistent, however it is still good.",1
Love this place.. soup dumplings are only the start.. crispy shredded beef i think are even better than the soup dumplings.. cash only and usually has a line.. also table sharing is common..,1
"Always plenty of people but it is worth it. The dumplings are very good and they serve generous portions.

But you have to sit with other random people, which can be fun.",1
"The service is fast although often grouchy. The restaurant is bright and clean. While it is out of the way, it is a tradition to visit for the superb fried rice!",1
"This place is still the best there is in Chinatown for good old soupy dumplings. There will be a wait, it will look like utter chaos outside. You will get elbowed by a little chinese old lady. But it is all worth it to have those delicious steamed treats.  I always get a vegetable side to make myself feel better for the gluttony - it never disappoints either. Have not tried much else on the menu.",1
So this was one of two best Dumpling spots I been. Please try the soup dumplings wow the broth is amazing. The noodle are pulled and cut just the way you like them. The beef pancake crispy and savory.,1
"Love the Xaio Long Bao here. The wrapper is incredibly thin (as it sound be), so be careful when picking up the dumpling en route to your mouth, hehe. The pork meatball inside is well seasoned and the broth is delicious! Between the 3 of us, we ordered 2 trays and devoured them all (and you bet we were taking count of how many each person ate because no one wanted to loose out, haha)! We also had the Kung Pao Chicken which was tasty. The scallion fried rice, however, was a little salty and I probably wouldn't order it again. All in all, Joe's Shanghai is a great little gem in Chinatown! PS: during peak hours, you'll likely sit at a community table (which is a lot of fun)!",1
"I've been wanting to try this place so I had very high expectations. We arrived there around noon and the place was packed. There was a wait but they got us in pretty quickly. The place is very traditional Chinese, in that they put you in a table with strangers so they can get as many people in and out as quickly as possible. 

We ordered a few items to try. We started with the Pork Fried Potstickers which were excellent. We also ordered the Crab Meat with Pork Meat Xiao Long Bao and the Chicken Pan Fried Noodles. The Pan Fried Noodles was delicious. Loved the flavor of the chicken and vegetables. My only complaint is the noodles were too thick and it was overcooked. But it helped to have the extra sauce to coat the noodles to soften it. The Crab Meat and Pork Meat Xiao Long Bao was a bit of a disappointment. I think I would have preferred the plain Pork Meat Xiao Long Bao. I thought the crab meat overpowered all the other flavors. Overall, I would recommend this place. Great food and low prices.",1
"Maybe it's something about that former location or whatnot but the softness and delicate nature of the bao's skin did not do it justice. Still juicy inside sure, but not complete. So for $15.00 and plus cash only, there are other competitive xiao long baos in the city!",1
"It's funny. I sat down and the waiter flips to the page with the dumplings and asks how many? 
I was about to ask ""How did you know?"" 
Did he have telepathic powers? Is he a mutant? Is this Asian guy Cyclops and Jean Grey's son, Nathan? 

But, I was starving, I didn't bother to ask. I just said ALL THE DUMPLINGS!!!!

But, really I ordered 8 crab and 8 pork = 16 dumplings. All the soupy goodness made me really full. I was actually afraid I was going to hurl in the restaurant. Lucky for everyone, I did...
Just kidding! 

I was fine in a few minutes. Loosened my belt in the restaurant. Rubbed my temporary buddha belly. Ah... and I had this sh!t eating grin on my face. Life is good. 

Verdict: Dumplings good. And cheap. $5 for pork and $7 for crab. And, so filling. 

I would come here again. 


Please don't steal this review, Nerdalicious. I spent 3 minutes on it.",1
"The soup dumplings here are phenomenal, and you are wasting your time and money if you go elsewhere and eat soup dumplings.
Really nothing else to say other then that the soup dumplings here are amazing.
They only take cash which is an inconvenience I'd be willing to go through to come eat their soup dumplings.",1
"Great spot downtown, my friend brought me here for their dimsum soup dumplings, first time trying them, loved!! Very nice environment, staff could be a bit more friendly-er, all in all we loved the food. I'd bring my family here next time if they crave Chinese food.",1
"You can't go wrong the with pork dumplings...or any of the dumplings. The service was amazing, we went in the middle of the afternoon to avoid the wait, it was what everyone had said it would be and if I lived in NY I would be a regular. If there's a wait it's worth it.",1
"First things first: This establishment is CASH ONLY so make your way to the ATM before arriving.
 
People have been raving about Joe's Shanghai so  made me way too Chinatown to try out their soup dumplings. This is a pretty popular place but luckily when I came in a weekday afternoon we were seated promptly. 

We order fried potstickers, crab soup dumplings and beef soup dumplings. Their potions are huge so we definitely had to take a box to go.

The soup dumplings were good and I appreciated their large side but I actually enjoyed their fried potstickers more. Since it received a lot of hype from people I had higher expectations but it was still decent. I would definitely come back for potstickers and to try other dishes.",1
"Holy cow dumplings! I don't know how I've lived in NYC this long and never been to this place. I suggest the crab dumplings and the carp belly. 
This place is excellent.",1
"This place is pretty good. 
The line moves fast. 
Soup dumplings was top notch
I would go back",1
"I can never get enough. 

Their new location has so much more space but the food quality has remained the same. 

This trip, we ended up with pork XLB, scallion pancake, salt and pepper pork chops and Shanghai noodles - all top notch.",1
The dumpings were great here but customer service not so much. If they sit you at a big table then you'll have to share the table with other people which i thought was a little odd but I'm from the south so maybe it's just me.,1
"Loved it! 

The juicy pork dumplings were one of the best I've had. There were plenty of soup inside each dumpling. I enjoyed it so much I came back before heading back to LA!  The crab & pork were good too but I would just stick to the pork ones.  Get the pea sprouts with garlic. It's delicious! All tables are communal. You will be seated with strangers! And it's crowded. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a big group unless you have an hour to wait around. 

CASH ONLY",1
"When I walked in, I saw a lot of old photos of popular Asian artists who've eaten at this place. I guess this serves as good advertisement for them.

Since everyone raves about their XLBs, we had to order that. Their dumplings were large, and I couldn't believe the amount of juice/soup that was contained in every dumpling. I'd never seen that much soup through the XLB skin before.  The skin was relatively thin and there was sufficient meat inside each dumpling. We'd ordered both the crab version and the original pork version.

However, taste wise, it was good but I wouldn't wait in line to eat here.  I enjoyed the XLBs from Koi Palace in Daly City, CA more. Btw, we were lucky that we didn't have to wait for a table, since we arrived during odd hours (3-4 pm). Never the less the restaurant was still 60-70% full at the time.


Anyways,",1
"Took some friends visiting out of states to Joes for some soup dumpling and Peking duck and it didn't disappoint. 
Services were good and friends loved the food. Win win. 
Jelly fish: 10/10
Spicy szechuan beef: 10/10 
Soup dumplings: 10/10, def order the ones with the crab meat, less dry and more soupy, texture is also better 
Scallion pancakes: 3/10, dry and no scallion flavor. A little disappointed at this. 
Sautéed snow pea leaves: 10/10 
Peking duck: 10/10, the skin is crispy
Overall, glad Joe's lives up to their standards and my friends were satisfied.",1
"This was our first stop on our first day in New York City this trip. My wife found this place on yelp and we decided to take an Uber there. We walked in this place and it was a full house. The soup dumplings are a must! Our meal consist of soup dumplings, two spring rolls, Beef fried rice, beer and sake! My wife also ordered some kind of soup noodle dish but I don't know what the name of it is. Overall the experience was good our service was great and the food was excellent.",1
"+93982093840810928019823081092 stars. 

JOE'S SHANGHAI is a MUST TRY when visiting chinatown. 
The SOUP DUMPLINGS are to DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE for. OGOMGOMGOMGOMOGMOMGOMGMGOMGOMOMGOMG.
Fried pancakes or whatever you call it is DELICIOUS too. 
& the give you complimentary oranges at the end. 

ajsdf;lajsd;fja;ls going back before I leave back to California.

P.S. THE WAIT IS TOTTALLLLLYYY worth it.  TRUST ME!!!!",1
"Ok, totally worth the hype. Their pork soup dumplings are the best ones I've had in the city. They are so good you don't even need the accompanying sauce. The soup is very rich, smooth, and satisfying. Crab dumplings... Meh... Stick to the pork ones, or try just to try them. 

It's communal seating but honestly who really cares. These places are always loud and crowded anyways. Came here at 5:30pm on a Friday and didn't wait long at all. They have lazy Susan's at the large round tables, but seems like they don't rely use them, not even to put the dumplings on the table. Oh well. 

We also got the crispy shredded beef. It was awesome. Crispy and sweet just how I love this dish. Dumplings here are where it's at. Just plan ahead and come early to avoid the crazy wait.",1
Don't expect good service but the food is unbelievable. Order the soup dumplings...don't hesitate.,1
"I've been dying to visit Joe's house to try some of his xiao long bao for the longest time now! It's been bookmarked on my Yelp for days, and now that my friend hustles around NYU, she finally took me and damn... Joe delivered the hot, steamy goods... woof.

It turns me on just thinking about how good the xiao long bao is here! I've seen my friends go up and down on their reviews, and perhaps it's a combination of the chef cooking that day, or how long it's been since I've had these little dragon dumplings, or maybe the fact that I think Din Tai Fung is hella overrated and needs to step down.

Yep, prob the later.

But you must try the food here. The hour long wait? Sure, but just grab some ice cream or boba before hand and you're settled. When you are seated, whether you are sharing a table or not, know what you want beforehand. The servers are busy but they try to help as much as they can considering the mob rush during the evening hours.

When you order the xiao long bao (pork or crab, either were great!), make sure you know how to eat it! Take a small bite on its side, suck it (the soup yo), and then swallow... or chew on the meat a little bit so that you don't burn your throat. Please dip it into the vinegar and ginger for an extra punch. The xiao long bao here are larger, have thicker skin, and are overall tastier.

You're still reading my review? You either have a really dirty mind, or are just hungry. I choose both.

Anyway, tag on a scallion pancake, some Shanghai Fried Noodles (which are not referred to as lo mein here), and you're all set! They even throw in some orange slices in true Chinese restaurant fashion when you end your meal.

Thanks Joe. You gave me a fab ride for my mouth... and you weren't that expensive either! Keep it up and I'll be coming back soon for round two, hun.",1
"Came here strictly for the Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao). It was absolutely the most delicious dumpling I ever dad. The wrapping hold so much soup and the filling was absolutely amazing. I had one of each of the pork and the crab filling. Price was very reasonable, 8 dumplings for $6-$8. We also ordered an onion pancake but that's pretty much it. I would give this place 5 stars for the dumpling itself, but the service here is not very good. We had to share tables with strangers and before we even sat down the waiters asked us what we want and I was like we didn't look at menu yet and he just rolled his eyes. When we got the check to pay and signed the credit card receipt, we pour some tea to drink and the waiter literally reached between our hands to grab the receipt. He couldn't wait 3 sec for us to put the tea pot down. If it wasn't for the super delicious dumplings, I will never come back.",1
"My go-to place for soup dumplings! Always crowded but worth to be in line.
recently found out that their chicken / peanut dishes are amazing, too.

Although they are cash only, prices are good!
This is a must-try place if you are in China town area.",1
"Joe's Shanghai reminds me of my dining experience in Shanghai.  I was seated in a round table with total strangers while enjoying their world famous Soup Dumplings stuffed with crab and pork meat.  Really enjoyed their super hot sweet and sour soup.

5*****S all around for the entire experience from food to service.  Can't wait to come back",1
"LOVE IT!  fantastic selection of dim sum and usual Chinese fare all authentic and delicious! this classic NYC SPOT adds to it's atmosphere with communal table seating where you can share NYC stories (or not) with neighbors and/or tourists alike. FUN FOOD! Often crowded, if going for Sunday dim sum, get there early for a good table!",1
If you Come here make sure you come with an empty stomach because while I was here I ended up ordering a second order of dumplings just because there is nothing in the DC area that can compare to it. Man I really want soup dumplings again!,1
"Yes this place is very touristy and yes the lines can be long on the weekends but they do very well on what most ppl go there for: the xiao long bao or the soupy dumplings. 

Now I can't say they are the best bc I've heard some other places in chinatown and queen's chinatown that rival these, but compared to the westcoast's reigning champ Din Tai Fung, I have to say they do edge them out slightly, mainly because of the amt of juice in Joe's dumplings and obviously the cost. 

As soon as you are seated the first thing they ask is if you want the dumplings. You have the choice of crab or pork. My fav is prolly the pork but the crab is good too but the broth can be really rich and after a few of them im kinda over it. If your with a group I rec getting an order of both (comes in 8 each). With the dumplings they are also known for their scallion pancake which isn't thing fancy but a fried asian pancake with scallions but its pretty good to snack on while you're waiting. 

I probably don't rec ordering other stuff on the menu unless you are having an all out dinner here since most dishes are family style and come in large portions. 


TIP: It's cash only and 15% tip is already added to the bill. Don't forget to immediately add ur name to the waiting list when u get there esp if you have a big group.",1
"Now living in Miami, I have dreams about these dumplings, literally. I woke up one night from a lovely dream I was sitting in Joe's with my favorite pork dumplings in front of me. I woke up salivating thinking of those lovely morsels. Yes, they are THAT good. The soup is actually inside the dumpling with the meat. It is hard to express the love that are these dumplings. I have been here so many times and I actually have had the other food. The other food is excellent but I always pass because I want to gorge myself with dumplings. You often will see celebrities rubbing elbows with common folk. Get to know your neighbors because you eat at the same table with other diners. By far one of the best eateries in NYC. Joe's Shanghai, I miss you dearly.",1
"This is my go to spot for soup dumplings. They have two varieties, crabmeat with pork or just pork.  Honestly, I don't see much difference in the crabmeat version, so why pay more?  I just stick with the pork dumplings.  If I'm hungry or with big group of friends, I'd go for the shanghai noodles as well, but often that's greasy, but tasty.  Aside from the dumplings, I'm not too impressed with their other food items.",1
"This was part of our food tour in NYC and we were already pretty full by the time we arrived. We ordered the crab dumplings, pork dumplings, scallion pancakes and chicken lo me in. The clm was ok but the dumplings and scallion pancakes were delicious. Next time we'll be back with empty stomachs.",1
"Joe's pork soup dumplings never fail to please, always friendly staff and excellent food 

They will tend to rush you and the line is ping but food is good (love the Peking duck)",1
"Delicious Shanghai Dumplings!! aka Xiao Long Bao. In fact, it's my favorite! It's a MUST-STOP for me on every NYC city. 

People ask me all the time, how does it compare to Din Tai Fung?? In my opinion, Din Tai Fung is overrated and is just ""OK"". Joe's Shanghai dumplings are waaay better! They are bigger, plumper, juicier, and tastier. What more can you ask for? 

They are steamed over lettuce, so they stay moist. The broth inside is soo juicy and flavorful! DTF barely has any juice inside. Also, here, they come in pork dumplings or pork & crab dumplings. I like both, so I always order a tray of each. The price is affordable like $10-12/each tray of 8 dumplings. (Can't remember exact price, sorry). 

My only complaint is the service. (-1 star) The Chinese waiters are not that friendly or nice, but I guess that's expected of a typical Chinese restaurant! This is your typical small Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Nothing pretty or fancy. But, the dumplings are so good that it keeps me coming back!",1
"Joe's Shanghai is like any other stereotypical Chinese restaurant.  It's staffed by no nonsense Chinese who may be a little blunt and ready to rush you out of there.  It's loud and crowded, but hey, you're not there for the atmosphere.  You're there for the xiao long bao!  We had a long layover in NYC, and decided this place was a must.  We ordered one pork and one pork and crab.  I preferred the pork and crab.  The pork was a little dry.  The pork and crab xiao long bao had the perfect amount of soup in it, the wrapper was just the right amount of thickness, and it was succulent.  Of course, I forgot that I recently had an allergic reaction to crab, and this set off another reaction, but it was totally worth it!  We also had two bowls of noodle soup, and they were delicious! Broth was flavorful, and it really hit the spot.",1
"Incredible Chinese food, fast service, everything is good!! Expect long waits on the weekends",1
"Soup dumplings! Best i ever had. Get them, other food on the menu comes in large portions enough for 2 maybe 3 to share i sometimes have to ask for extra white rice ( the white rice serving is small) communal seating, they will show you how to eat the dumplings. I really enjoy coming here very crowded on the weekend, during the week is best",1
"Joe's Shanghai is the spot you bring your friends who are visiting NYC -- total tourist spot. That being said, the quality of the food does not disappoint and it's overall a stellar experience.

The location has moved from Pell St. to Bowery so trade the older, kinda funny (XLB + vinegar) smelling space for a new modern, clean look. It's in prime location and during rush hours it'll most definitely attract an impressive crowd.

Must orders:

- Scallion pancake
- Shanghai fried flat noodles
- XLBs! pork... try the crab too!

You can get most of the standard banquet-style Chinese foods here... it's all solid. Don't forget to add an overpriced veggie -- gotta get that fiber!",1
"Our go to place when in Chinatown.  The soup dumplings are quite delicious and filling and the scallion pancakes are quite possibly the best I've ever had.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of communal sitting, the food and the prices are what always have me coming back!",1
"Warm, flavorful soup dumplings perfect for a cold day. One of the most popular soup dumpling places in the city. Expect a 30 or so minute wait outside the restaurant. It's always packed so expect to sit at a table with other parties. 

A no-frills place that focuses on the food. The waiters come over and ask you for your soup dumpling order just as you sit down and those take longer to make than other dishes. 

I come here for their crab dumplings. Delicious and a wonderful flavor! Their pork dumplings are great as well. Lots of broth and meat and the dumpling skin isn't too thick. Thin skin which still holds in all the broth! 

Great casual, cheap, delicious meal.",1
"Absolute 5 stars! 

This review is just for the dumplings and the service. They are known for their dumplings, so why would you order anything else! The dumplings are seriously some of the best I have ever had. Have you guys heard of din Tai Fung, very known for their dumplings. Well....I loved it here more than din Tai Fung!!! I can't believe I am saying that. I wasn't hungry when I came, so I think it tells a lot how good they were. The soup inside the dumpling was so flavorful, unlike I have ever had. 

Now, we all expect bad service at a Chinese restaurant, but the employees here are on top of it! Given the volume of ppl they get, they stay pleasant and very approachable. It was soooo busy when we came, but since there were only two of us, they seated us right away at a table with other ppl. Yes! That's a thing here. They seat you at tables with other parties. 

Oh, another thing would be the price!!!! I think it was like $7 for 8 dumplings. That is not expensive at all! Especially for that kind of quality and deliciousness! I would pay more than $7 any day! 

The bad thing about discovering these yummmmmmmy dumplings would be craving them and no way of getting my fix. ):",1
My goodness. I only had the chicken fried rice but it was simply amazing. I will be remembering this place for when I am in the area again.,1
"This place is NOT a tourist trap.  Yes, the service is a bit rough around the edges, but the food, and the soup dumplings in particular are excellent.  The dumplings are quite simply one of the best things I've ever had.  They are rich and delicate at the same time, they are soft and softer, which leads me desiring something crunchy.  Despite the textural neutrality, these are just amazing little dumplings.  Not sure if I prefer the pork or the crab versions, they are both excellent .  

One piece of advice, do not order 2 orders at once, because they will stack the steamed containers on top of each other, and by the time you are finished with the top order, the bottom layer have had time to cool a bit and perhaps deflate.  Order one at a time.  Occasionally they will put a few too close together, so when you grab one, it rips and looses its wonderful broth.  Its a real bummer, you can watch the disappointment around the table when it happens.  Eating them is a bit complicated, but after a few orders I think i have it down, and it adds a bit of fun to the meal.  Take a small bite, then a small sip, but leave enough broth for the big bite with the filling, perhaps add some of the pungent black vinegar/soy/ginger mixture on the table that I happen to think is fantastic, or the red peppers in oil which is great but not hot enough.  

After that soft hot course perhaps follow up with the scallion pancakes for that needed crunch.  Also very good, hot and crunchy but not too oily.  Or change it up with a cold course.  We had the Fried tofo, which was surprisingly spongy, although packed, or should i say soaked with flavor so I enjoyed it.  The Singapore noodles were the best dish aside from the dumplings, they rival Udon for the thickest noodles I've ever had and i think they win.  Great chewy noodles with a few nice greens, another fulling and tasty dish, although as expected a bit oily.   

I can't give this place 5 stars, because every time I go, there seems to be some issue at the circular communal tables with strangers talking too loud about either their sex life or their inability to pay the bill not realizing Joe's Shanghai only accepts cash, welcome to chinatown.   I understand that sitting at these tables is the price we pay for such amazing food and its just part of the experience, unless you are the lucky enough couple to get the table for 2 by the door (you are MINE next time!), so I wont dock them too many stars for that, but it does dampen the dining experience a bit.  If you have 7 people and can get an entire table by yourself, I suggest ordering a bunch of dishes, most importantly the soup dumplings and share it all.  Very highly recommended, if you can stand the awkwardness of the communal table and the mediocre and sometimes rushed service.  I look forward to returning to try the Razor Clams.",1
First time visiting Joe's Shanghai.  Their crab and pork soup dumpling was pretty big compared to other places.  You can definitely taste the crab.,1
"Do you like wonton packets of heaven?""

These soup dumpling blings that everyone is talking about are actually really good.  I bring all my ""out of towner"" friends to this place, and it always is a hit.  I wouldn't make a habit of eating these luscious things that ooze possible lard-like substance that promotes post orgasmic spasms.  And yes, everyone has their techniques which is always fun to watch and marvel.  But ask the busy wait staff, what is the freshest vegetable that is in season or fish as well.  Sometimes it pays off to order off the menu.  But I am a big fan of the chicken rice cake thing.  It reminds me of thinly sliced Japanese mochi noodles - and always filling.  And my friends always seem to want to get the Singapore Curry mei fun - I have a weakness for it as well.  But if you just stick to 2 stacks of steamed soup dumplings, you won't go away unhappy.  Mange, Mange!",1
"Must go for the soup dumplings!!!

We also got the eggplant and pork and it was amazing. Service was fast.  Don't miss this spot!",1
"Best soup dumplings I've had in America! 

I lived in Shanghai for a year so I've definitely gotten a taste of the best from the original creators. 

The skin of the soup dumping was just the perfect thickness, not too thin as to where all the soup would leak out, but not too thick as it would be tough to chew either. It was a good balance. The best skins do the job of holding the soup and meat together, adding a slight chew, but not changing the nature of the dumpling and making it taste too starchy. 

The pork and soup was simple, but absolutely delightful. The best is that after the savory tastes passed, the soup brought a slightly sweet after taste, making you crave more.

Seriously, don't come and not order the soup dumplings. It's a must!",1
"My favorite place for pork soup dumplings!! Fair warning - it breaks easy.. so have your soup spoon ready!!! Thank goodness there's ALOT of juice in it!!! We also ordered the egg plant dish, sesame chicken, and Sichuan beef which were all good. Will definitely come back.",1
"The soup dumplings are a must have. They are very hot (like they should be) so be careful when you first eat them. Another thing I would recommend are the scallion pancakes. It's very basic, but you can never go wrong with them. Joe's is generally very busy so depending on how many you're with, your seating might feel a little bit cramped.",1
Soup dumpling heaven! Enough said. #1 in NYC,1
"Have you met my friend Cathy H? She wrote a really great review of Joe's Shanghai where she offers step-by-step directions on how to eat Xiao Long Boa(see here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2#hrid:TeX-A9rZ5es92mHEJv8xOQ). 

First let me say, you MUST eat at Joe's Shanghai, when in NYC Chinatown, and like other yelpers have said the one thing you absolutely must get are these dumplings. They are a rarity on most menus (at least in DC) and the ones they make here are superb.

I took Cathy's list of directions as a table side reference on my last visit to Joe's Shanghai, because every time I have eaten here I managed to make a big sloppy mess of myself. If you're shy about how to tackle eating a delicate soup filled dumplings, I recommend printing her review out and bringing it with you.

Be aware that Joe's Shanghai seats people family style, so if you come in as a pair you will most likely be seated at a big table with others. Normally, this is not a problem, but you have XLB dysfunction like I do, you'll get performance anxiety at the thought of eating this delicious yet technically complicated dumpling in front of other people, particularly if you're non-Asian. This might be a result of my many years under the watchful eye of my former Asian Mother in Law or the fact that I am not familiar with foods that gush. 

Every single other person in this restaurant, manages to eat their XLB with such grace, gently lifting it with tongs, biting small holes and sucking out that delicious broth like a freaking dumpling vampires. They finish their entire basket of dumplings with a clean white plate and table cloth under them. I complete a bowl of dumplings with pants and shirt covered in broth, my plate overflowing in broth, and with a table cloth with soup slaughter stains all over it.

So if you're not as skilled as 99% of this restaurant is with eating XLB, I now present my own instructions for eating XLB:

Step One: Wear a dark shirt and pants
Step Two: Walk in and be seated with other patrons.
Step Three: Order either pork and/or pork with crab XLB, request 2 additional cloth napkins.
Step Four: Make sure other dining patrons are not watching and judging you.
Step Five: Grab XLB from basket with tongs, accidentally puncture the top, place on spoon 
Step Six: Act like you know what you are doing and puncture a small hole with your mouth, try to suck out broth (which is thick and oily, and flavorful).
Step Seven: Scream cause it's hot.
Step Eight: drop dumpling on plate, watch broth ooze from all the dumpling puncture wounds
Step Nine: Make sure other dining patrons are not watching and judging you.
Step Ten: Grab injured XLB, spoon sauce on it and shove in your mouth
Step Eleven:  Scream cause it's hot.
Step Twelve: Repeat steps 4-11 for the rest of the remaining 7 dumplings.

Despite the mess and extra laundry to do, these dumplings are amazing, and worth it. I can't wait for my next trip!",1
Pork soup dumplings were good but quite big and slightly difficult to eat. Pork friend rice was dry and did not have much flavor.  The crispy beef was well balanced flavor wise.  Crisp pork chop was great !   General Tso's was just okay.  Service was attentive.  Tight quarters with seating. They definitely pack people in there .,1
"It was a casual Sunday night and while things in Chinatown seemed to be slowing down just a tad, you would have thought the line outside Joe's Shanghai was for the launching of the iPad 6.0. Their waiting system is actually pretty efficient, as they give you a ticketed number, you put your name down and (hungrily) wait it out until your number is called.  For as many people as there were crowded outside, the wait was only about 30 minutes--they seriously get you in and out and on with your night without making you feel rushed. Even if you do want to stay there all night to eat up all the soup dumplings they've got in the back. 

I honestly think that if you only ordered the soup dumplings you would be thoroughly satisfied.  This is not to spurn the rest of their menu (because everything was extremely satisfying) but it is to say that if you only have a limited amount of time in New York like myself then you want to over-compensate for the fact that you may never encounter dumpling like this again, hence the necessity for five orders of the mixed (pork and crab) dumplings.  You want to slurp and savor those joyful delights of packaged wonder and then do it ten times again. If you don't care about having lots of variety at your meal then yes, order only the soup dumplings and be shameless about it.  We also ordered the baby bok choy and mu shu pork that you fold into the pancakes. Again, all Chinese dishes to die for.  

It's communal seating so don't be prissy and shy about eating amongst strangers. If anything, it makes your meal that much more enticing because you notice that old school families know exactly what to order and oh look! They also ordered three rounds of soup dumplings. They totally know what's up.  The service is very fast and runs with the efficiency of a well-oiled machine. Reasonable prices make this one of the best meals I've had in New York.",1
"Believe the hype!   I'm not sure why fellow yelpers aren't giving this place high ratings.  The food is so good!!   I like seasoning and spice and despise bland food.  If you want watered down food, go elsewhere.  But if you want good Chinese food, huge portions, good prices and amazing soup dumplings, go to Joe's Shanghai.  We went on a Friday night and we had to wait about thirty minutes to be seated.  It was packed inside and out.  There were 4 of us, 2 of whom were Chinese, and we sat at a table by ourselves.   Yes, the place is cramped and it definitely is not the most lavish place, but the food is excellent! Our hostess was nice and the servers were attentive.  

We had 2 orders of Xiao Long Bao(and we ate all of them, 4/person, lol), pork and crab & pork, I preferred the plain pork, but the crab & pork dumpling was fine too.  We also ordered a ton of food, all of which was delicious: I highly recommend the Orange Beef, the  Shanghai Fried Flat Noodles and the Mu Shu Pork.  A couple of things to note: almost as soon as you sit down, a server will ask you if you want soup dumplings, just know before going there whether or not you want them--they take time to prepare as they are handmade.  Also, this is not a place for lingering, when you are done eating, the servers will want you to pay, so other people can sit down, so just keep that in mind.  I will definitely go back to this place very often and it's not even remotely close to my apt.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is by far my favorite ""Real"" Chinese food Restaurant in (China Town) NYC. The Place is a little ""Overrated"" but definitely the best Chinese Food your money can buy. The Place is always packed, there is always a wait of 20-30 minutes, and always a line of people that spills out the door into the Street. Your Patience will be rewarded. Once your number is called, you are entering a Frenzy, the Restaurant is always super packed, you are guaranteed to sit in a table with complete strangers, Its cool I've never had a problem with it, just a bit awkward lol. There ""Soup Dumplings"" is a must, its the first thing the waiter asks you when you are seated, ""what kind of dumpling"""" Ordering these dumplings is a must. We always order the pork & crab dumplings, they come out hot and Steamy served on a steam tray, the dumplings are full of Flavor Liquid and just pop in your mouth with flavor, they are literally full of soup and are to die for, but careful because they are so hot that i always burn my mouth lol. They have an extensive menu, everything I've tried so far is pretty good, Beef with Scallions, Shrimp Fried Rice, Pan-Fried Flat Noodles and Seafood, Salt & Pepper Pork chop etc. The Staff is very attentive and service is pretty quick. This is not the Typical place where you sit for hours and spend time conversing and sipping your wine or eating desert, You almost feel the common courtesy to eat rather quickly to give courtesy to the 100 people waiting in line outside for their turn to enter and take your place next lol. That overall decor of the restaurant is not fancy, the Atmosphere is Lively, (Very Busy). I recommend this place to anyone who is interested in eating ""Real"" NYC Chinese food in China Town.",1
"My friends and I went here for our friends giving last year and my I can't wait to go back this year.

So this place is in the back streets of Chinatown which kinda made it hard for my friends and I to find, but we were very glad we did. The wait was about 20 minutes which wouldn't have been bad if it wasn't pouring outside and the only place to stand and wait was outside the restaurant not ok when your umbrella is flying away and you weren't weather prepared.

Anyhow we weren't able to be seated until all of our guests were present which made the wait a little longer, which was our friends fault. When we were seated we were immediately greeted by a waiter and he took our drink orders. The only problem was that we could barely understand him and vice versa ( good thing our friend spoke Chinese because One of my friends was allergic to peanuts and the waiter couldn't understand that in english.)

The food was amazing we literally ordered 2 orders of Pork, Chicken and Beef dumplings, 2 orders of rice (fried rice, and chicken fried rice) The shredded pork soup was phenomenal! For approximately 8 of us the food portions were average and it did leave me personally full.

The drink variety is slim but the food variety is amazing. We're having our annual Friendsgiving there again this year and I can't wait to try the duck this time!",1
"We ordered:
+ Bok Choy: I needed some greens during my trip. It's not on the menu but they offer it.
+ Scallion Pancake: we could have done without this but it was so crispy and good. Since it was fried, this pancake filled me up in the beginning.
+ Pork Dumplings (XLB): These were the first XLBs I have enjoyed other than my favorite (Din Tai Fung). They are massive and hard to ""plop"" in your mouth. I made a mess several times; trying to open the dumpling, pour the soup in my spoon, or even just placing the whole thing in my mouth. It was a quite an embarrassing moment... but I looked at others and they too were also struggling.
+ Crispy Shredded Beef: hands down a favorite dish of the night. It came with a small side of broccoli which was nice for an added green vegetable. 
+ Fried Noodles: This ""chow mein"" like dish was delicious. Super oily but filled with cabbage and chicken which was delicious.

Hubs and I clearly ordered more food than we could eat on our last night in New York. I wasn't really watching the food come out and assumed the plates were fairly small (comparing it to DTF). Yeah, no. These are fairly large family styled plates. I highly recommend to not order the amount we did unless you want leftovers. They packed our food really well and we were able to take it back home with us without any spills or even a smell. It warmed up well and tasted just as delicious.

I recommend checking out Joe's Shanghai if you have the time. And by time, I mean roughly 30+ minutes to stand outside until they call you inside to wait some more until your table is ready. Cheers!",1
"On a rainy night in the city, this was definitely a great stop. There was a short wait, and you may have to share your table with strangers, but sucking the broth from those pork dumplings was awesome. Is this place better than Din Tai Fung in Cali...not quite, but close. Their dumpling were a bit too thick skinned for me, yet they are larger in size. Also, the meat mixture in Din Tai Fung's is better, and at Joe's, they don't have the red vinegar with ginger.",1
"not too good of service because it was so busy but the food was AMAZING!!!! I am soooo addicted to it! I want it again! and again- This is a great place to people watch as well 

xoxo Jenna",1
"We went back here again after going to Top of the Rocks. we went here at 10pm (they close at 11pm) and it was still packed! thankfully we didn't have to really wait.. AND we got our own table this time (last time we had to share a table with a group of people). 

We originally were gnna try the other Joe's Shanghai that wasnt in Chinatown.. but we noticed that they give you fewer number of dumplings and charge you more. Instead we went to Joe's in Chinatown.. and it was well worth it again! Definitely one of my favorite spots. Tastes great on a cold night!",1
"I am so glad I came to Joe's Shanghai! I had seen several recommendations on both yelp and YouTube. The food did not disappoint! It was very busy when I went alone at about 2:30 but I was seated immediately at a community table. There were several couples at the table and I had a great conversation with a man traveling from Germany. 

I read a recommendation for the pork meat soup dumplings so that is what I ordered. They were FANTASTIC! 

I was wishing I wasn't alone so I could share multiple dishes.  Several of the other couples at my table ordered noodles which looked and smelled amazing! I am definitely going to bring my husband back here for dinner to try the lo mein and sesame chicken!",1
"Dope as fuck, get racks on racks on racks of soup dumplings and then leave. Theres no need for an entree. The crab one sometimes tastes kind of fishy, so get the normal one to be safe.",1
"Soup dumplings were great (definitely better than average) but the fried rice and house chicken (basically sweet and sour chicken) were both super average.

Cash only!!!",1
"YUM this place is so goooood. I only recently discovered Joe's Shanghai after four years of living in the city and it could be my biggest regret yet. Their xiao long bao are the best I've had in the city. I definitely prefer the pork over the crab, although for some reason everyone I know feels the other way. And yes I HAVE tried other things on the menu, although I admit its reallyyy hard to get past those dumplings. The Yang Chow fried rice is tasty and not too oily. The Shanghai Fried Noodles are tasty too, but I wish they'd have a little more veggies to balance out all the dark sauce. The scallion pancakes were meh, but that's how I feel about almost all scallion pancakes.

Random non-food related tips: Cash only. 15% tip is added but they make that pretty clear on the bill. Communal seating, dont be scared. And the waiters are actually really nice once you get over the fact that they're rushing you (seriously, their turnover rate is unbelievable)",1
"Best soup dumpling place in china town for sure. the place is always crowded. i went there last sunday, the wait was like almost an hour but it was definitely worth. going back again!",1
"I have been wanting to try Joe's Shanghai for years now. Finally, I was able to make it down to Chinatown to try the soup dumplings.

We got to the restaurant and the people at the ""front"" asked us if we wanted to wait (about 20 minutes) or sit at a shared table. We didn't want to wait so we sat at a 6 person table and ordered quickly.  I do have to say that it was a bit awkward at first but we got talking with our neighbors.

We got the scallion pancake as an appetizer and the pork only dumpling and the pork and shrimp dumpling. The scallion pancake was crispy and well cooked bit I just wished it was a bit warmer.
Both dumpling orders (most of the dumplings with the exception of a few that were punctured) were filled with delicious broth. The dumplings itself are larger than the kind I have had at Din Tai Fung and definitely more soup (in those that were intact). The soup was fattier also. 

I was disappointed that some dumplings were broken and the soup had leaked out.  

Definitely worth making your way down to Chinatown to try the soup dumplings!",1
"I still dream about these dumplings!! I want to go backkkk! I've tried soup dumplings in so-cal and Joe's Shanghai totally wins in flavor and taste!! We tried both the pork and crab soup dumplings....i personally liked the crab ones better because they were more flavorful to me, but my friends really liked the pork ones. The dumplings are very large with a lot of soup filled inside and only $5 for each batch.",1
"This was definitely an experience for the books. I truly had no idea what I was getting into when I brought my girlfriend and family here based on the yelp reviews. 

We followed our yelp map deep into Chinatown, where the streets smell of fish and garbage and you stick out like a sore thumb if you're not Asian. When we were in sight of the restaurant, I knew that we had to be in the right place because there was a crowd of people waiting outside to get in. 

There was a 'Hunger Games' sort of vibe in the air as the hostess walked out with her list every 10 minutes or so and everyone in our group prayed that she would shout out our number so that we could come inside, away from the garbage and fish. I thought that I heard her call out our number and I shouted, ""I'm here! Number two!""  And I ran to the door. She didn't even look and said, ""wrong number, we number three."" I turned around and walked back to my spot in shame with my head hung low.

After 30 minutes of waiting in the alley we were finally called. Honestly, it was pretty weird inside. They had us sitting at a communal table, which I had heard about, but somehow figured that it could not possibly happen to us. Yup, there we were, with two Asian families that seemed to know the drill here. The waiter came up and asked not, ""Do you know what you will be having tonight?"" But, ""Which dumplings do you want, #9, or #10?"" My father was dumbfounded, and had a ""what the heck are you talking about,"" look on his face. We ended up settling on the #9. (They are famous for their dumplings, and we did know this before we entered.) The waiters were very weird... to say the least. One of them kept leaning on my dad's shoulder while her surveyed the room. It was so bizarre that it was actually very funny.

Let me just say that these were the best dumplings I've ever had. They were served in these wooden circular dishes that they were likely cooked in as well. The broth inside of the dumplings was unreal. Seriously, amazing!

My parents had the fried rice and pork shoulder. I did try both. The pork shoulder was very tender and had some great flavor. The fried rice was too greasy, I didn't like it. Sadly, the experience left Elizabeth (my girlfriend) without an appetite, so she didn't eat.

As we were finishing, the waiters began hustling us to get out. They must have asked if we were done three times before we were even done eating.

To be honest, the dumplings really saved the day here. They were so amazing that they really overshadowed the rest of the experience's flaws. For the record, everyone else hated this meal... I thought it was incredibly entertaining and funny.",1
"Oh how I miss you, soup dumplings!",1
The food was good and the wait is long but it goes by fast. The service was good and the food came out pretty fast. I recommend it.,1
Very busy but not a long wait. Family style seating if your a couple of two. Dumplings and stuff ordered by a friend. I will report soon. Some kind of pancake.. lol it's GOOD.  Dumblings are very hot( temperature) but GOOD!  Walk over or Uber. Definitely a stop if you are in NYC.,1
"Came here on 3/3/16 and thank goodness my coworker dragged us here.  We walked! Walked a good 5 miles to get to this place thinking it was closer.  This restaurant is located in an alley of China Town.  Cobble stone streets that gave it an old world feel, pretty cool! We didn't wait too long to be seated.  Our table was a communal table, meaning we shared the round table with 2-other couples.  Which can be awkward.  We ordered two different dumplings.. and they were juicy, hot awesomness.  Loved them!! we also ordered a few other items but they were did not impress me as much as the dumplings!

The place is small, and cash only!  Take a look at the photos on the wall, many celebs have dined there!  Would come here again when in town.",1
"*** 4.5 stars ***

After complaining about how there's no good Chinese food in NYC (at least in the borough of Manhattan) I stand corrected. We ordered Joe's on Christmas Day and everything we had was excellent. I ordered online and made a mistake (accidentally ordering two eggplants) and wanted Moo Shu Chicken but the platform only offered pork, so I called them after placing my order and they were able to switch out the extra eggplant for green beans and switch the meat on the Moo Shu. The gentleman on the phone was very patient and helpful due to it being probably their busiest day of the year. He said that it would take a while due to how busy they were, but it was only about 35 minutes before our take out order was ready to pick up (even though the duck alone was supposed to take 40). We arrived to a huge crowd waiting outside for a table - great sign.

For 3 of us (and leftovers for many meals - they gave us serving ware for 10...):

Peking Duck Half 30
Snow Pea Leave 20
Moo Shu Pork (Chicken) 19
Shrimp Pan Fried Noodle 20
Pork Dumpling (8) 12
Eggplant with Garlic Sauce 17 
Sauteed String Beans 17
House Special Glazed Crispy Chicken 23

The duck was a great price and my only complaint is that the skin was a bit fattier than I would have liked. Definitely on the pricey side at ~$20 per dish including veggies, but this is NYC after all. Our favorite dish was probably the House Special Glazed Crispy Chicken - it had an orange chicken/ general gau's like sauce but was larger pieces of quality chicken meat than either of those dishes generally is.

A definite NYC favorite!",1
I came where because of what I heard from others and the plentiful Zugat awards the restaurant has received. My family and I ordered 2 different types of soup dumplings - the pork dumpling and the crab dumping. The dumplings were delicious and so was the soup inside. One thing I recommend is not to order to much. We ordered about 6 trays for 8 people and that was way too much. I believe most people can eat around 3-6 dumplings before you are tired of it so order wisely.,1
"I've only ever head soup dumplings in Boston's Chinatown, so I can't say that I have much to compare to. However, the pork dumplings and the crab dumplings I had here were great! The service here was pretty quick as well, which I appreciated. I also recommend getting their fried rice, as it wasn't too salty and it was a great way to fill up after having some dumplings. Don't forget to sprinkle some of the black vinegar on basically everything! Also this place is cash only.",1
"Get the xiao long bao, and nothing else! Joe's Shanghai has been bookmarked for years and I finally got a chance to try it after my third time in NY :). 

Came here before our Peter Luger reservation lmao but had to squeeze it in since I really wanted to try. 

We didn't have to wait around 4pm and since the xiao long baos are so popular, when you're seated they already ask if you wanna place an order so they can start prepping them. 

We also tried the Peking duck and maybe I'm a Peking duck snob but it wasn't good. The crepes they give you to wrap the duck were more like full sized tortillas. I'm used to crepes half the size, and much thinner. The Peking duck skin was good but the meat was dry.

Would opt to just get the dumplings next time if we come back. 

Cash only, of course!",1
"In this day of COVID, they do a pretty nice job at their new location.  The tables are definitely spaced apart and the servers aren't pushing you out which is a nice change.   The bathroom is down a steep set of stairs so that's something to consider if this is a challenge for you or a friend.  The soap in the bathroom is about 1 part soap to 30 parts water so be sure you have hand sanitizer with you (there's was empty).  We had a nice experience and I'm glad we went.",1
"Loved everything about this place. The service was fast and the food was fresh and delicious. The soup dumplings are definitely to die for. Juicy and tasty. Crispy beef, pan fried noodles, fried pork ribs are amazing. Definitely go there again",1
"Very good food. Cash only, just fyi, but there is ATM available. 35 minute wait to get in for lunch, but service was quick after that.",1
"I would give it a 3.5 star if I can, but yelp don't have the option. Don't get me wrong, the food is still good, but I guess I was disappointed because my new york friends set a high expectation for me since they always boo-booing Chicago's chinese food.
1. soup dumplings (xiao long bao), we got the crab meat one, well it doesn't taste like crab meat, maybe it just has high pork meat to crab meat ratio? the size is huge, so $7-8 for 8 dumplings is a great deal. tons of soup, but I don't feel the dough wrapper is thin enough and the soup is not as savory. it didn't give me the euphoria when the soup burst in my mouth that I had when I was eating soup dumplings at Lao Szechuan in Chicago.  The spicy whole fish is good too. but be careful because you need to be good at teasing the meat off the bone. 
2. atmosphere: super crowded and you will have to share tables with other parties. they don't take reservations for party less than 10. so on a Sat night you will have to wait for ~15-20 mins. 
3. service: pretty fast and friendly service compare to other restaurants in Chinatown, but the waiters might come off as impatient (its understandable tho, considering how busy they are and how many tables they have to deal with).",1
"What a treat it was to come here! The place was bustling with customers but I was seated rather quickly, only waiting a total of about 15 minutes. 

I wasn't expecting to sit with a table of random people (that's how small it is and how packed it gets), but it wasn't an issue and everyone either socialized or kept to themselves. 

The service was okay. No water is provided unless you ask, and it took about 10 minutes to get my sprite. The food however comes out in a timely manner, even fast I would say.

We ordered the crab/pork soup dumplings, the pork soup dumplings, the lo Mein, and the kung pao. The crab/pork soup dumplings were amazing. I've had better in Philly, but a close second for sure! The pork soup dumplings were just okay, def tasted different than the crab ones which sometimes some places skimp on the crab and you can't tell the difference. The main dishes were AMAZING. I wasn't expecting this place to wow me outside of the soup dumplings but the kung pao was some of the best I've ever tasted.

I'll be back!",1
"short wait and the staff was friendly. After a very hectic day, we ordered dumplings and two entrees. The chicken was really good and generous portions.",1
"So I've been to the one in Flushing. And it was very good. Joe's in a Chinatown for the win! Amazing meal (even despite the wait during the Christmas Day rush.) soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, crispy beef. Definitely recommend!",1
"Good food, but a bit crowded. Service is also inconsistent (i.e. they may stop by intermittently, but you can usually catch someone's attention).",1
"Its been 4 days since I've had Joe's dumplings and it doesnt feel nice. Ive had Shanghai Dumplings IN Shanghai and I don't remember it being as good as this!!!!
You must order the scallion pancakes....I couldn't stop eating them.",1
The soup dumplings here are unreal. The fried dumplings are fantastic. Service is fast and efficient. Great food and dining experience.,1
Wonderful food! Soup dumplings are spot on and the scallion pancakes are worth it too!,1
"Must try: dumplings! I went to shop in new york for the day and was unhappy because my boyfriend rushed my time there so we can go eat here.  So, i wasn't in the mood for anything basically.  Our friend ordered 4 things of dumplings and told me that I must try them, and so I did and that's when I fell in love!! Its something about them: the sauce they serve the dumplings with, the hot steamy bamboo baskets they had them in, everything was perfect.
This place is very crowded, we had to share a table that's how crowded it was (but i guess that's how all busy NY restaurants are?).  I'm usually very impatient, but for the dumplings i didn't mind waiting  a little.  I will try to make it to this restaurant every chance i get now. Awesomeness.",1
The best soup dumplings in the world!!! I come to New York just to have some!!! Every bite is an orgasm and you won't forget it!!!! HIGHY RECOMMENDED!!!,1
"My Favorite spot for Chinese food in NY...Yes its crowded and I've had better service at other places, so if that really bothers you get your food to go or delivered...because this place makes great food! The soup dumplings are a must order, I also like the shanghai fried flat noodles, crispy duck, and chicken and shrimp in plum sauce.",1
"I have never had a bad meal here, and I go often! In/Out vibe, no frills. Wine is low quality but delish! Fast Service. Sometimes a wait, but worth it!",1
"this place is a small whole in the wall in new York's china town. it was a couple blocks for the subway but worth the walk. if you're with a small group, expect to be seated with strangers. this is my first experience and I'm quite positive that others were a tad uncomfortable eating face to face with strangers too. i love the soup dumpling here, especially the seafood one. It is so juicy and each bite (for me) was tastier than the other. I like to eat it with chili oil and dip it in the vinegar soy sauce they offer. the lo mien is yummy too. i was so stuffed from the hot and sour soup and dumplings that i couldn't finish the lo mien.

in terms of cleanliness, it reminded me of any type of Chinese restaurant in china town. the service was prompt but the waiters have heavy accent.  this was my second trip there, and it wont be my last.",1
"CONS: not the classiest joint in town, not very friendly staff, and it's cash only
PROS: fast service, you only have to tip 15% since it's already included on each check, and awesome food

I've had the soup dumplings, the sesame chicken, the fried rice, the lo mein, the chive pancakes and the duck. I've also had the sake here. It's very yummy. It's a place to go for the food not the dining experience.",1
"Great dumplings, a classic in NYC. Usually feel a little full/sick after a big order but it's worth it....",1
"Went here last night with my bff's family. We got our ticket and the lady said it'll be a 40 minute wait. Turned out to be an hour and 30 min wait. At this point we had no patience. When they called out our number, everyone waiting outside clapped for us since it was our turn after waiting for so long!! We ordered 4 boxes of pork soup dumplings(8 pieces in a box), Sea Bass, and spicy shrimp with broccoli. Everything was delicious. Place is super busy so go early!",1
"whenever i come to nyc, i always need a trip to joes. just give me a basket of xiao long baos and i'm good to go. the soup inside one dumpling fills up a whole white soup spoon. juuuicy!",1
"Last week, my boyfriend, friends and I went to a horrific Shanghainese restaurant called 456 Shanghai Cuisine and ate unpleasing soup dumplings. I always wanted to try Joe's Shanghai and tonight my boyfriend and my best friend decided to go eat. I love trying food with them, because they're opened to trying most new places and food as well!

It was semi-busy when we got there around 6PM. I was still a little stuffed from my lunch, but I had room for a light dinner. We had three bamboo steamers of soup dumplings. We had two pork soup dumplings and one crab & pork dumplings.The soup dumplings were voluptuous, plump, delicious, hot, and heavenly! These were about the standard size of a typical soup dumpling.

 As soon as the soup dumplings came, I was breathing in that heavenly scent of soup dumplings. It felt as if I was getting a facial. Any way, there was real meat inside and broth was just excellent! I took my sweet time savoring it!  The crab & pork soup dumpling was a little mediocre because we didn't really taste the soup. I'm not sure where it went. 

We had two plates of scallion pancake. It was golden brown, crispy, crunchy, and I felt as if I was getting a foodgasm because it was one of the best scallion pancakes I ever had. We also got a plate of beef fried noodles. I am not sure if that's the actual name, but I couldn't quite finish my portion cause it was so fattening and so much noodles! I almost fell into food coma because of the food, my boyfriend and my best friend just kept piling food on my soup spoon and plate. Thanks a lot guys!

Overall, a great dinner experience with top-notch service and dirt cheap! The total came out to $44.23, which isn't bad because we had 2 plates of scallion pancake, 3 plates of soup dumpling, 5 cans of soda, and 1 plate of noodles! Great food and Great company, really go hand in hand. It's been a while since I came upon a great restaurant in Chinatown, but I've got to say Joe's Shanghai won my heart.

Yay for Joe's Shanghai!",1
"I don't know many other places where you can go to eat for $80 for a group of 7 people. The line was a bit crazy (lots of tourists and we waited 40 minutes on a Sunday at 7pm), but I'm really happy we waited! Our waiter was so sweet and helpful with vegetarian options.",1

"My friends and I decided to celebrate the Mid Autumn Moon Festival by going out and finally trying the famed Joe's Shanghai. After walking through a relatively empty Chinatown at night and passing several other restaurants that almost lured us in, we finally reached Joe's!

The wait was incredibly long though. They have a number system like most other restaurants so nothing too complicated. The hostess told us it'd be about 30 minutes, but it turned out to be more like 50 minutes. Even then we had to share a large table with two other parties. It didn't bother me or my friends, but if you'd prefer privacy, maybe come by at a slower time? (If it actually happens at Joe's.)

We ordered the famed xiao long baos, the Peking style minced pork noodles, and kung pao chicken (why not). The xiao long baos were great! The noodles were decent too; super generous portions for only $4.95 (really great deal...it was enough for four of us). The kung pao chicken was alright, nothing to rave about but I'm not a huge fan of this dish anyway. The total came to be about $32 so $8 a person! Really great meal for such a low price. I definitely want to come back here as soon as possible and try out their other dishes!",1
"By far the best soup dumplings I've had... eaten in tandem with with an onion pancake, downed with a chilled bottle of Tsingtao, the combination becomes something living, breathing, right near and straight out of the faded yellow pages of the legendary Chinese folk tales your mom told you at one point in your life to never believe, to forget completely.  An experience worth passing down, generation after generation.  The suspense of not breaking the outer shell in fragile transport by chopsticks' end, an eternity to the vinegar soy sauce concoction.  The first bite, the anticipation of the indescribable seasoned, animal-derived fatty soup flooding the roof of your already-salivating mouth, so delicate, yet you just want to get it over with and go for the kill.  You do.  And it was great.",1
"The most fabulous dumplings in the whole of Manhattan! Super thin casing that you bite into and suck out the soupy juice and bite into the hearty meat.  I'd give them 5 stars only for the fact that it's always packed, there's often a wait and the staff/servers are always brusk",1
"We went on Sunday around 2-3pm and the wait was about 25 min for 2 people. They were very busy! The food was so good!!! I highly recommend the crab and pork soup dumplings, I haven't had a soup dumpling like that before! The scallion pancakes were super crunchy and crispy with a great scallion taste, also recommended! The service was quick and the food came out fast.",1
I love this place. The service is fast and the soup dumplings are to die for. I make sure to visit at least once every time I'm in NYC,1
"I looked this place on Yelp and found all of the ""rave"" reviews...so we ventured our way into Chinatown and found it! Plastered on the front window was an newspaper article in Japanese praising this place for it's ""shiyoronpo"" or pork-ginger dumpling with soup inside. It is always a good sign to see that the Japanese community has put a mark on this place. Not a full serve dim sum place, but very tasty dumplings. 
I recommend sticking with the traditional pork shiyoronpo.....crab, not so  much.",1
Soup dumplings. Crispy shredded beef. Yum. Service not as good but good is pretty on point,1

"We have been coming to Joe's Shanghai for over 15 years or longer. It has been consistent in its quality and affordability. We love the pork dumplings and baby shrimp entree. At one point, we could fill up for under $11. This time around, it was more like $45 for 3 people with a side of scallion pancake. We have also tried the mid-town location but love this one for the shared table, crowds and generally efficient service. You can sit, order, eat and pay all within 30 minutes on a good day. It is not a place to linger. I recommend it to everyone and not everyone wants to wait in line but I don't think anyone is ever disappointed. I would even say it is BETTER than Ding Ta Fun.",1
"Tickets and Hotel for 5 days = $1,600, Tickets for Broadway Shows = $ 600 for 2 shows, subway ticket to Canal street = $2, Joe's Shanghai dumplings = $PRICELESS. 

Let me start off by saying we were here in New York for 5 days and went to Joe's 5 days. We were given a list of 15-20 restaurant recommendations from my girlfriend's friend and his advice was if we were to only to go to ONE restaurant within that list, it had to be Joe's. 

How great can a chinese dumpling place be you ask? Well put it this way, we actually ordered the wrong dumplings the first day and we left thinking that we had just had dumplings from Heaven. We're from San Francisco so we've got pretty amazing palettes and aren't easily impressed, but this place was all that and a plate of dumplings.",1
"really amazing pork soup dumplings! highly recommend it. the dumpling skin is thin and very chewy, not thick at all which a lot of places could be, and the broth is heavy but not too heavy. it's light in a way and you don't really feel gross after. they give you a side of soy sauce ginger vinegar to eat with the soup dumplings, more heavy on the vinegar side, but it really helps and compliments the soup dumplings by cutting through all that oily fat.

it does get really packed, so come at an odd time.",1
"We tried their crab w/ pork and just pork soup dumplings. They are good fresh, but you let it down cool too much, the skin hardens and is not as delectable.

These soup dumplings are very juicy, but fragile. They were not as enjoyable when you accidentally rip them open and lose the soup inside. The crab w/ pork was more unique than the regular pork, but both were good.

The pan fried dumplings were too oily. The pan fried noodles suffered the same fate. The thick white noodles were different from the yellow egg noodles I am used to.

Overall enjoyable, but I would not wait in a long line to eat here.",1
"Arrived with my boyfriend at 645pm on a Wednesday and we were seated immediately. Didn't read yelp reviews so wasn't expecting to sit at a communal family table, sharing it with 4 other people. Anyway, it wasn't bad or that awkward, but scanning around the room I could definitely tell people at other tables felt uncomfortable haha. 

Service was DEFINITELY rushed - I felt so rushed to order that I just made my boyfriend order everything  (didn't care what to get) and he didn't look at the menu, he just spewed staple dishes in Cantonese. Food came super fast, it was DELICIOUS. The pork dumplings were good, definitely had better, but still good- dumplings were very large with lots of soup that came on a bed of steamed cabbage (instead of the regular wax paper), which I thought was a nice touch. But let me take a second to RAVE about the young chow fried rice. Holy sh!t, best fried rice I've ever had! My boyfriend also ordered these pea shoots dish which were fantastic, but since he hadn't looked at the menu, turns out they cost almost $17 (omg, $17 for veggies)... he didn't mind since apparently these pea shoots were as authentic as he remembered them from his hometown. 

The waiters watched you like a hawk to collect empty plates. Funny story time: I was struggling to get the last dumpling from the bamboo basket onto my spoon with my chopsticks (what an epic fai), and mind you the waiter is watching you the entire time to collect the soon-to-be empty bamboo basket - so I think he either got real frustrated with my chopsticks skills or was too eager to collect the empty basket that he suddenly literally picked up the dumpling with the tongs and placed it onto my spoon. Literally no emotion on his face while he did it. I didn't ask for help. And then he picked up the basket and was gone with the wind. Who does that???? I laughed so hard. But I can see how other people may think it was an intrusion of privacy since it pretty much was. Either way, I thought the entire situation was funny and wanted to share it here.

Anyway 4 stars because the food was phenomenal. I'm coming back, regardless of the service!",1
"The food is ALWAYS amazing quality! Everyone can find something here. I was able to select more than 3-4 servings because of the menu's variety. They ALWAYS have great noodles and dumplings. I visited twice last week and still can't get enough of the soup dumplings (made with pork and crab meat, to be exact) and will definitely order the orange beef. It was worth the roughly 20 minutes we spent waiting. I'll see you again soon!",1
"Usually just go here for the soup dumplings, which are possibly the best thing in the world, but their other food, isn't really that great. But I don't mind coz I could eat those soup dumplings every meal, seven days a week. If you go for dinner, be prepared to wait up to an hour. They use a crazy numbering system that can seem random. The lady originally told us 30 minutes, which went down to 10, and five minutes later became 20 again. When all was said and done we actually waited for an hour. They seat you at tables of 8 with random people which can be a cool experience if they're friendly or just whatever if they're not. Either way, really cheap food, really good soup dumplings, you need nothing more. 

Tip: If you're looking for Joes Shanghai, don't get duped by all the imposter Chinese restaurants nearby with ""Joe"" or ""Shanghai"" in their name. Also, I don't recommend the midtown location.",1
"HEY TOURIST! If you're only gonna to order Fried Rice and Kung Pao Chicken, pick any other joint in Chinatown and save yourself the wait. Sheesh.",1
"Tried this place out and I love it! I saw some of the reviews that others had made for this place and I have got to stop by and try it for myself. And what the people say about this, is accurate and spot on! The food is wonderful, employees are great, the prices are ideally to food and portions! Great job and I recommend anyone to try this place out as I had done as well!",1
"Came here on a Sunday around 11:00 for lunch. The place was already half filled with patrons. By 12:15, it was full. We were waited on right away. And the servers were attentive and did not forget anything. They checked on us, changed our plates mid meal and made sure our water cups were always full. The place was a bit on the noisy side with great conversations all around. Good for families, but not for intimate dates. 

We ordered two different kinds of dumplings, two different noodle dishes, green beans and salt&pepper pork chops. All was cooked and flavored well. We were not disappointed with anything. Serving sizes were as expected.",1
"This is the best Chinese food in NYC. Hands down. I have been coming here for my entire life. The steamed buns are an absolute must, and the jelly fish is amazing. Go out on a limb and try it. Don't bother with ordering American Chinese food, because this is a legit establishment and they will probably laugh at you. I have heard the soft shell crabs are great and I will be trying them in a few minutes. Seriously it is worth the wait, as hesitant as I am to write this review and make the wait longer for myself. Enjoy!",1
"Best Xiao Long Baos or Shanghai Dumplings I have ever had! My last trip to NYC we had to go two days in a row to satisfy us. We ordered the pork and crab dumplings and the hot and sour soup. 

There might be a little bit of a wait but it is well worth it! Also, keep in mind that you might end up sharing a table with other people since they are always so busy. The reason why this place isn't getting a 5 star rating is because the service. They are not very attentive at all.",1
"I love soup dumplings! I personally enjoy these more than the Din Tai Fung ones in Taiwan, which is blasphemy for some, but these are just... more delicious. I think they are slightly greasier, but that's probably what makes them taste so good. 

Please make sure you have cash, since it's cash-only. 

We waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday night. I didn't love the lady barking out numbers angrily, but about 20 minutes into our wait she seemed to have a change of heart and started asking for all our numbers and asked us to be patient. 

Once we were seated, a waiter came by very quickly to get our soup dumpling orders, so that we could get them started while we decided on what other things to eat. We got one order per person: two pork ($4.95 each), one crab ($7.95), and it seemed like just the right amount. We also got a soup to start-- super reasonable at about $5-- and each got at least a bowl's worth out of it. To try to balance it out, we got stir-fried snow pea shoots, which were the most expensive at about $14, and another appetizer. 

Everything came out quickly and while the place was busy, I never felt rushed. Service is about what you expect at a Chinese restaurant, though I think the servers' English here is better than usual, probably because it's such a hot tourist spot.",1
"I will fly here from San Francisco to eat Xiao Long Bao! But it's also because I can :)

The soup dumplings here are truly delicious; the skin is thin enough, and still retains the soup. A bad dumpling would have skin that is too thick but it's hard to have thin skin because the soup will likely leak from it.

Prices are great, very fair. 

I've had their noodle and soup dishes, all good, and all authentic.

They even sell my favorite ginger ale (I actually discovered it here).

This place is popular so expect to share tables!

Unfortunately, I once had to share with these three 'adults' whom could not stop talking crap about people they knew. Their content got x-rated too. I was really surprised by their bitterness. They seemed neither disabled, nor poor; why be so hateful? Negative vibes like this damper any meal, but Joe's Shanghai was still pretty damn good despite the smell of ugly insides just a few seats away.",1
"I have been to many place for soup dumplings to see if I can find a better one than Joe's shanghai serves. I have found none! I truly believe that Joe's Shanghai has the best soup dumpling outside of Shanghai. I should have known this since whenever I do come here there's always a line and a little bit of a wait. No other place I've been to has had a line. I know I'm not alone when thinking if there's a line somewhere then it must be worth the wait! 

Second, as soon as you're seated they immediately ask you ""how many soup dumplings?"" They know everyone comes here significantally for that and then if you want to order some other things then that's okay too. But if you come here and dare not order soup dumplings then curses on you! 

They come out in thier little steam baskets, served on lettuce, the cutiest and most tastiest little pouches hold your choice of either pork and crab or just pork and filled with this broth that is just mmmm! Be very careful when eating them since they are super hot! The first time I remember I came out of that restaurant with no tastebuds lol.

I like using the technique of putting them on my spoon and nipping a little hole through the side and sipping the broth out slowly. Do Not pour out the broth! That is the wrong method and irritates me when people do that! Lol. You're ruining the whole purpose of the ""soup dumpling"".  Anyway, if I order anything else, they have very good ""Mongolian beef"" aka beef with scallions, ""young chow fried rice"" and ""pan fried noodles"". All are really good options. No complaints on the staff, they were always very nice and move quickly. Seating is set up family style, meaning you are most likely going to be seated with other people, but if you come with a group, you will probably end up with a table to yourself. If I can eat these everyday I would! Simply put, delicious!",1
"Wednesday night at around 8:30pm and the line are still long with about 30 people waiting to enter the restaurant. No reservations waited about 30 minutes and most tables are communion and shared with others. Only cash. It is all worth it. Known for their soup dumplings, 8 in 1 serving, we had the pork, and crab fillings. They are served very hot and you need to wait before diving into them. We continued with the chicken orange and the Shanghai Fried Flat Noodles. Inexpensive and good.",1
"Insta@dish_360 

The Good: We wanted the best soup dumplings and both Google and Yelp pointed us to Joe's Shanghai. We got the crab and pork meat soup dumplings. Okay, so basically it's a dumpling that has your protein of choice and when you bite down the soup pours out. Absolutely. Frikkin. Delicious. 

We also had the scallion pancake which was crisp and addicting. Texturally, they complimented the dumplings and didn't feel too ""heavy."" 

The Bad: Cash only. NBD they had an ATM on site. Also, the wait staff is not pleasant by any means  not a deal breaker for us. I saw other reviews that echoed this sentiment. Honestly, I don't care as much about service as a lot of people do. I'd go back for the dumplings as long as the quality in the kitchen held up. ‍ I'm also not a fan of the shared tables. We just aren't social enough to want to share a table with a bunch of people we don't know but that's personal preference.

Aftermath: This isn't an intimate date night spot. We tried the items they're known for and we left happy. We'd be back but I'm not sure if I'd explore the rest of the menu. It's not a place I would care to sit and spend a lot of time at. I'd eat what I knew was going to be executed well and then leave.

"THE BEST OF THE BEST!

despise of the LONG BRUTAL wait and the unorganized wait list, the soup dumplings is really worth the wait. 

each bite is a burst of juicy flavor and you can really taste the perfection in each dumpling. the order comes with steamed cabbage and is a nice touch. orders come out pipping hot so make sure you cool off the soup after you take a little bite. just make sure you don't spill the soup inside because it's the best part of it all!

we ordered the green onion pancake and WOW. just WOW. it was seriously the best one i've tasted. i wish i ordered a whole plate to myself.

when you come to joes just stick to the soup dumplings and the green onion pancakes. the other entrees are mediocre. just stay away from ordering too much other items. 

you will be seated with other parties so be prepared to sit in a big table with strangers. food comes out fast so you'll be on your way quickly. remember CASH only. enjoy!",1
"Greatest dumplings in New York - hands down.  I really don't know what else to say but ""Just go!""  If there is a line at Joe's Shanghai walk one block down Pell Street and head to Joe's Ginger.... same owner ... same food ... same AMAZING dumplings ... all without the outrageous lines you find at Joe's Shanghai.  

I would skip going to Joe's if you aren't into dumplings.  The rest of their food is mediocre.

Bon apetite!",1
"Is there anything I can say about this New York institution that hasn't already been said? No, but here's my review anyways. 

This spot is for anyone who has a craving for soup dumplings, wants an introduction to soup dumplings, or has a bit of time on their hands for the wait time. However, I highly suggest shifting your eating schedule slightly up if you're planning on visiting- especially on the weekends. By arriving around 11:30 am, instead of 12 to 3, you can get seated almost immediately, rather than standing outside for around 45 minutes after the place (and queue) fills up faster than the speed of light.

My theory is that their soup dumplings went ""viral"" on the internet due to the novelty of having soup inside of a dumpling, which seems rather rare in other cultures. However, other authentic Chinese dishes are just as great, but without a funky combination of two foods. If you're new to Chinese food, I highly recommend trying out the 鱼香茄子, or ""Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (w. Pork)"", under the vegetables section. It's the ultimate combination of sweet and savory, which pairs incredibly with the creamy eggplant. It must be eaten with rice. 

The bathroom is a little janky, especially having to walk down a narrow corridor of steps to get to it, but the rest of the restaurant is nice and clean! I'm not sure that it would be accessible to people with mobility issues.",1
"Soup dumplings are really good but sitting next to strangers?  Maybe not so much.  It's probably just staying true to Chinatown fashion, but if there's an empty seat next to you, best believe it's going to be filled up whether you know that person or not.  It's actually kind of funny how every seat is utilized and at a round table made for ten, you may know only one other person.  It's New York right?  

Prices are true to Chinatown form as well and though you can get these same soup dumplings elsewhere, Joe's Shanghai has built a reputation akin to Grimaldi's and you just have to visit at least once to say you've been there.  There's a location in Flushing and midtown as well but the Manhattan Chinatown version is kind of THE spot to try out.  Flushing is good too, and midtown I have no idea, but I believe it's pricier and not as good.  I would imagine it's not as good because of the direct correlation in price and geographic location in relation to the downtown spot.

The wait is not too long and there's fairly quick turnover.  On weekend nights, it gets hypercrowded and I would imagine it's not really a place yo want to go if you want to have engaging and intimate conversation but if you want to make new friends then I guess it's the spot for you.

It's definitely on my must visit places for out-of-towners.",1
"My favorite Chinese restaurant in all of Chinatown.  Ive been to them ALL.  This is the spot.  Open pretty late and the food is ALWAYS fantastic.  Fresh with a very very large selection.  I usually get the shrimp in white sauce.  mmmmmmm  it gets pretty hectic here, but that's part of the fun.  Busy and bustling Chinatown.  If you're not into all that, you can always take your food to go and if you live in the area, they deliver.  I also recommend the pork dumplings.  Fantastic.",1
"I arrived here for the soup dumplings. When we got in, we were quickly seated. The place seemed very compact, but I actually liked the atmosphere. It was a little dark but it was a good change of pace to the dirty sunny day that I went there. 

The dumplings were amazing. The soup inside was delicious, and the size of each dumpling was pretty big. It was a nice starter for me. I would definitely go back here.",1
"siu luo bao. It's the MUST-HAVE item in the US outside of Shanghai, China.  

I've only found 1 other place in the west coast that has it, and it keeps me content, but not satisfied.",1
"excellent quality for the price! we were able to walk in without any wait on a thursday night but I imagine this place gets pretty busy. Classic dim sum restaurant scene with a busy bustling energy. For the food, we started with the pork soup dumplings. GET THIS. They were huge, first of all, for the price and could easily make a whole meal. I loved slurping out the soup and found it very flavorful. We also got the scallion pancakes, which if you're a fan of these are especially tasty (if a bit oily - but I don't mind that). Lastly we got the half peking duck. Again great portion size and had a perfectly crispy skin with a hefty amount of meat. 

Overall, this is a great spot for a group of friends looking for a warm hearty meal. I definitely recommend!",1
"The dishes here are from Shanghai apparently (as the name denotes).

Beware: They don't accept reservations and Cash ONLY. 

1. Food
 
*Scallion pancake - just ok and wish they gave us more than 2 small dishes for the sauce 
*Pork and Veggie dumplings - no question of course the pork dumplings were flavorful so skip the veggie dumplings unless looking for vegetarian dish 
*Squid with salt and jalapeño - still loved Hop Li (LA Chinatown) version 
*Whole Peking Duck - for a whole duck, skimpy serving of the green onions (not sure why) and the sauce. It was served with these tortilla-like wrap which we did not like for to us did not compliment the duck. We still prefer those fluffy white buns 
*Orange Beef - it was recommended and it was everyone's favorite dish

*Service - we had a water spill and they quickly mopped it so really appreciated that 

There were a lot of people waiting when we got there at 6 pm. We were given a ticket with our number and were told the wait was for 30-40 minutes. At 35 minutes, they called our party of 5 - not a bad estimation from the hostess

It was pricey as far as we were all concerned and the servings are not big.

It is a very popular restaurant in Chinatown (NY) and I can see why. If this is your first time and wanted to try Chinese food in NY - solid Chinese restaurant to try for first time visitors.",1
"I love Joe's! I've been coming here for years and I absolutely love it here!

I've loved everything I've eaten here.

My favorites are the: sesame chicken and the pork soup dumplings! They're both delicious and flavorful!

I can't wait to come back here! I'll definitely be back again soon!",1
Ordered the well-reviewed Crab and Pork Dumpling (8 piece) for takeout. The dumplings were filled with a good amount of crab meat while the dough was chewy and soft. I look forward to dining-in and trying more items in the future.,1
"Fantastic and authentic Asian restaurant. Went with two friends on a Saturday night and enjoyed the pork soup dumplings, Kung pao chicken & shredded beef with green peppers (my favorite). Excellent food, very reasonable prices. Some of the best Chinese good I've ever had honestly.  

My only issue was the crowded restaurant and community tables.  The tables aren't any larger than your traditional dinner table yet they stick you next to strangers to share your dinner. It's more than worth the compromise though.",1
"Pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. [insert Homer Simpson voice here]

So amazing! Yum, yum, I love eating these here! Fried dumplings are also good, but the Pork Soup Dumplings are the Bomb!!!

If you come in a small group you may end up sitting with a whole bunch of strangers, but you need to overlook that. These dumplings ROCK!",1
"Can you say soup dumplings? Pretty much the most well known soup dumpling place in Chinatown - and the recognition is well deserved! Very good food. Usually a wait.. expect to share tables. And as with all Chinatown joints, curt, quick and loud service, cheap cheap cheap, and overall propensity to over-order.",1
"I brought my family to try Joe's Shanghai in their new location and I can say they don't disappoint! We ordered several batches of soup dumplings but who doesn't? What I can recommend is to just focus on ordering the soup dumplings. While you can order other items on the menu, soup dumplings is what they're known for!

Now for the description of the soup dumping... it has just the right density for the dumpling wrap and once you bite into it, soup just oozes out and so deliciously into your spoon (or if you prefer sipping it as you drink it). 

Just be careful as you bite into it! I once had an accident where I bit into the dumpling too fast and all the soup squirted onto my tie! I'll never make that mistake again!",1
"So bomb. Massive soup dumplings! Ordered way too much food. 
The scallion pan cake is perfect too, crispy and hot.",1
"My favorite place to get steamed soup dumplings in New York. This restaurant definitely lives up to all the hype and is definitely worth your time to visit. The soup buns are huge and spectacular. They are fresh, juicy and have the perfect texture inside and out. I like to eat them plain with no sauce because of how delicious all the natural flavors already are on their own. 

I would also recommend getting the scallion pancakes which are cooked to perfection: crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside. I come here every time I visit New York and always bring my friends.",1
Great Chinese food. General tsos beats their Seaseme chicken. And their pork dumplings have a seasoning I don't love but over all above average Chinese food.,1
This place is heaven! The best soup dumplings I have ever had! The West Coast has nothing like them! All the food was delish we! However we as a bit exaggeration we waited for over 3 hours when we where initially told 30 min. We had just landed in NY & our friends treated to this dinner thru told us it was a must try when in the city. We were hungry and tired & did I mention cold! So the wait was ridiculous but the food was the best I had while in NYC.,1
"A few New York natives recommended this restaurant in the heart of Chinatown so I had to check it out! The food was all so enjoyable and there was great value for the price paid, especially with these huge portions. The Sesame Chicken was probably my favorite, it was some of the best chicken I've ever had. 

Also they don't take reservations, but we came in around noon on a Friday and got seated immediately, and the service was quick! If I lived in New York, I'd come here all the time.",1
"Just your average restaurant that is fortunate to have a legacy. Rushed and busy, it is good for people watching but that's about it. Soup dumplings are the same as most I have had. 
And they add a tip in already. Most don't check so they get double tip.",1
"Crab and pork xiao long bao (soup dumplings) FTW!

Joe's Shanghai strikes me as a very straightforward restaurant. With the large volume of customers, they receive - they tend to rush your order as well as try to sit you with strangers to maximize seating as much as possible. Which is fine- I know what I'm going to order hours before I make the trip into the city anyways. 

If you are the kind of person who has problems with strangers staring at you eating while waiting for their own food - Joe's Shanghai might not be the place for you. But if you're a fan of skillfully crafted dough married with flavorful hit-the-back of your throat meaty broth, disregard the haters and be sure to be your own critic with this joint. Sometimes, classics are classics for a reason. And also, be sure to bring cash.",1

Verdict:  Dumplings are perfect (nothing in Seattle compares). Everything else I've tried (that day as well as during previous visits, such as the scallion pancake) are solid performers. Haven't been disappointed by any dish yet.

Highlights:  The dumplings, for sure.  They are generously proportioned, and have just the right amount of juice inside. Very quick service.

Tips:  Consider ordering one tray of dumplings at a time.  When the dumplings get cold, the juice inside will congeal and the skin won't be soft and malleable as it should be.  

Be prepared to wait, as this place is always packed unless you arrive right when they open.

Also, be prepared to ""share"" a table with others.  I don't mind this, because it gets me my food quicker, but others who aren't used to this concept (sitting at the same table as a family of 6) may be turned off.",1
"Highly recommend trying their soup dumplings. Definitely some of the best I've had, better than Din Tai Fung in my opinion. Cash only and gratuity was included in the bill. 

I can see how this place can get busy so avoid coming during peak meal times. They seat you wherever there's an available seat so you'll most likely share the table with other guests. The service is fast and I can see how it can be a bit intimidating if you don't speak Chinese. Don't get offended if they seem curt or unwelcoming!

As we were looking through the menu, they waiter came by and asked if we were going to order the soup dumplings and he could put that in first while we kept browsing. 

The pork soup dumplings (8 pieces) are huge! And there's so much fatty, savory soup inside. If this is your first time eating soup dumplings, DO NOT just take a bite out of the dumpling. The soup inside the dumplings is meant to be drained/drank first. I felt that the skin was a little too thick. But it did help prevent the dumpling from breaking easily and losing all the soup inside. 

Wish we got more orders but we wanted to try soup dumplings from other restaurants in the area.",1
"One of my friends highly recommended this place when I went to New York.  I'm glad I listened and tried this place because OMG.... I've found a new love!

This place was packed on a Wednesday night.  Bf and I ended up having to share a table with a family of 5.  The family was super nice so we didn't really mind much.

We ordered one crab and one pork xiao long bao.  Each order comes with 8 pieces of delicious soup dumplings for about $5!!  We also ordered shanghai noodles and onion pancake.  

This was my first time ever eating xiao long bao.  Add a lil bit of vinegar and soy ginger and OMG.....it was delicious!!  The dough was not too thick and not too thin and held the soup inside really well.  MmMm.. foodgasm!  Ever since i came back home I've been looking all over san jose for a place comparable to Joe's Shanghai but none I've tried even come close to half of joe's xiao long bao goodness.  the shanghai noodles and onion pancake were also very tasty.  One of the best onion pancakes I've had.

While boarding the plane back to the bay one of the things running through my mind was regretting not coming here again before leaving NYC.  This place is definitely on the top of my list when i go back to NYC.

5+++ for Joe's Shanghai!",1
"i was a first timer at this!  but, ive always wanted to try shanghai dumplings for awhile now.  

this place is located right in an alley.  its get pretty packed.  especially during the early mornings.  keep in mind that you will have to share a table with complete strangers.

dumplings were the only things we ordered each and every time we came here.  they come in crab/pork or just plain ol' pork.

they're little dumplings filled with soup broth.  please make note that these little suckers are HOTTTT.  i burnt my tongue and lips at the excited-ness of trying them out! =X  

there's also a technique to eat them.  pick them up.  put it on your soup spoon.  bite a tiny little hole.  blow.  then you can suck the soup out.  then just eat away! =P

theyre soOooo freaken tastyyyy!  i love it!  theyre a must try!",1
SOUP DUMPLINGS (and if you don't know how to eat them it's cool--they'll gladly give you the tutorial) lazy Susan round table with strangers is so communal I dig it,1
"This place has the best soup dumplings I've had in the city so far.  I was brought here by a Chinese ex-pat years ago, and he took control when we were ordering.  Couple orders of soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, cold sesame noodles, fried rice cakes, and some other stuff which I can no longer remember.  We ate a TON of food and I was stuffed, but it was one of those situations where it all tasted so good, neither of us could stop.

As I said, the soup dumplings are sort of the main attraction here, but the rogue winner in my book is the fried rice cake dish they offer.  They make these medallions of rice dough, which have the consistency of udon noodles or dumplings in a way, and stir fry them with whatever you choose.  They're pretty unique and as I've come to realize, a bit of a challenge to find.  At least at the Chinese places I frequent, it is not common to see on menus.  If you like chow fun or similar types of noodle or rice dishes, you'll most likely enjoy this, too.

Unfortunately, this place has really jumped the shark in terms of tourist draw and over the top hype.  It's often a mob scene now with very long lines to get in.  Yes, it's good, but as others have stated, there are a plethora of other options in the immediate vicinity that accomplish virtually the same.  With that said, if you can stand the wait, or if you can go at non-peak hours, it is definitely worth a visit.  I have taken groups here on several occasions and it's always a big hit, particularly with out-of-towners.  I love the communal, family style seating they offer.  Almost always guarantees an interesting experience!",1
"Wow, this place is quite the experience! First off - it was located in Chinatown and we found parking extremely difficult to find. We went on a weeknight and the wait was long, and discovered it was cash only but luckily there was an ATM right outside the restaurant! Be warned: the restaurant has a B health rating. We didn't have high expectations from the looks of it.

They seated us at a large table with strangers - a bit awkward, but it seems that is the norm so that they can reduce wait times. Our food came out quickly, although the service was a bit lacking. Had to ask for water, etc. several times and it seemed like the servers just didn't want to be bothered. 

As for the food - the entrees were good, but my favorite item here was the pork xiao long bao (soup dumplings). They are quite large, and the soup inside is so flavorful! They come in orders of 10 and our table ended up ordering 7 orders!! Next time I go, this is all I will order! I also really liked the green beans with minced pork as a side.

It ended up being very affordable for a large group.

Loss of a star for the poor service and entrees not up to par with the soup dumplings.",1
"Pork soup dumplings are virtually identical to pork and crab, so don't both with the crab.   Shanghai noodle with beef are also delicious.  Salt fried pork chops are not worth it.  Cheap and delicious.",1
"Forgot to review this when I went to NYC for vacation. But, for record keeping sake, come here to eat the XLB! Great prices and it's one of the juiciest XLB I've eaten! (Disclaimer: I have not been to Shanghai; just comparing SF XLB to NYC/Joe's) Stick to the traditional XLB. I recalled the scallop one not being as tasty.",1
"Why would you go to Joes Shanghai - well, that's an easy one - soup dumplings. They are way bigger and more filling than others I've tried. Surprisingly, they travel well too. I feel like I end up here with coworkers for lunch more often than I do dinner but good for both occasions. There's better Chinese food around but their known for their soup dumpling.",1
"If heaven served Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings, no one would ever sin again. In my opinion, if you venture to this spot, you must order the soup dumplings, and only the soup dumplings. The other food on the menu is good, but nothing to write home about, or a review for that matter. Take a hint from the long lines outside of the door: the dumplings are awesome and everyone, except for you, knows about it. Clue yourself in and take some dumplings to your face.

-1 star for service. It's hit or miss. One time I asked for a hot sake, which I've had there a dozen times. The server looked back to the kitchen and almost whispered, ""hot sake, I have to make that"". Then he looked back at me and told me that they don't have any. I asked a different server, who heated some up, brought it to me promptly. Our server was put out that I went to someone else, but that didn't stop me from returning here. To tell the truth, they could mess up the drink orders every time, and I'd still be happy as long as they got the dumplings right.",1
"Best dumplings everrrrrr!!!!!!

Perfect on a nice cold winter day - pork soup dumplings and wash it down with a Tsingtao - pure deliciousness!!!

The only thing is that it could get a little crowded, so depending on what time of day it is you might have to wait a lil bit!

And I know sometimes one can get a little weirded out about sitting at the round tables with strangers, but for me it adds to the experience! (it's funny watching people watching you on your own strategy of how to eat a soup dumpling!!!",1
Very authentic Shanghainese food! We sampled both types of Xiao Long Bao and the pan seared dumplings. Very delicious and authentic. Nicely done!,1
"We got here around 2PM and the place was packed. Waited about 20 mins to be seated. We were a party of 6 so that could be why. The food was very good. The best was the pork with scallions!! It didn't seem touristy like some people say, seemed like a lot of locals too. I would have given it 5 stars but our waiter was not too friendly. I guess the excuse could be that they were very busy. I would definitely be back!",1
Delicious soup dumplings and wonderful family vibe throughout the restaurant! Worth the wait and not too heavy on the wallet for delicious food with great portions!,1
"I always have a craving for Shanghai food every other week. If I could I would eat it every week! I've been going to Joe Shanghai since I was a little kid and I loved it! 

Their staple item are their soup dumplings which is usually number one and two on their menu. I always order both the crab meat and also the pork since I'm always with a group we usually always devour the soup dumplings. Be careful not to have all the soupy goodness spill! Their scallion pancakes are always so crispy and good. I always like to dip it in their vinegar sauce or the sauce that comes with their fried pork dumplings. These fried dumplings aren't like the ones you get at a dollar dumpling spot because the sauce that comes with it makes it a million times better! 

For souls I always opt for the hot and sour soup. If you never had it before it's different but in a good way. It's spicy so be careful! If you wanted to opt for something not spicy their chicken soup with corn is good but a little basic. 

For vegetables I love getting their eggplant or string beans! I don't know what is it but the way they cook their eggplant is so good especially with the sauce they add. It's a little spicy but it's not terrible! I can never handle spicy but this was bearable. 

For noodle and rice dishes my favorite are their Shanghai noodles and fried rice cake! Those choices never let me down and it comes on a pretty big portion to share with a group. For rice dishes I always opt for their Singapore chow mei fun. It's a little spicy to beware but it's delicious! 

The only downside is that they don't have fun smoothie drinks or bubble tea. They have soda, tea, and beer so you'll have some options. But the service is very quick although it might be annoying to flag someone down when you need a water refill but they're very quick with taking your order. 

This place also gets super crowded during dinner so you might be waiting for a while. During lunch time on the weekdays it's not terribly crowded.",1
"Crab Dumplings were very unique and tasty if you like crab :)
Pork XLBs were super juicy, however, I like my XLBs a tad bit smaller, perhaps bite size. lol Their XLBS are huge, it takes me about 4 -5 bites which defeats the purpose in my opinion. 

I do LOVE their green onion pancake, it's the best i've ever had, hands down :)

Oh expect to share a table with 2 - 3 other parties depending on the size of your group. It's cool though, reminded me very much of Hong Kong :)",1
"Came here because of yelp reviews.  Opened at 11 and arrived at 12 PM on saturday of thanksgiving weekend and there was already a 30 min wait.  It was well worth it.  Service was rude but prompt and efficient which is what I prefer.  If you are a small party they will seat you at a larger table that is shared between several other parties.  Although it was packed, food came out promptly and was piping hot.  

Got the soup dumplings which were good but not the best I've had.  They were a little greasy and heavy for my taste.  Also tried the scallion pancake and shanghai stir fried noodles which were good and slightly above average.  The noodles tasted fresh and homemade.  Good experience overall.  Would go back.  There is a lot left to be desired.",1
"Authentic as it gets, walked in to a full house but was seated within minutes. Soup dumplings are like nothing I've tasted. Protip: look around for a pro dumplings eater to figure out how to tackle these things. Other dishes were great as well. I'd go back.",1
"Famous for the Shanghai style soup dumplings. Perfect on a cold day, ideal Chinese comfort food
Must be careful how you eat to avoid getting your mouth burned by the very hot soup...bite or cut the corner, to let the soup cool off before eating",1
"Gets a little used to the vinegar smell from their dipping sauce that invades the whole restaurant but the food is definitely worth it. This is definitely a must try. I had both of their dumplings shrimp and pork. This is such an amazing type of food. Lol. I did my research on how to eat it properly before I went and I'm glad I did as I did not make a fool of myself. I took one star away for the service. It seems like they dislike anyone who is not Asian, the server and manger really seemed to be acting like jerks but I gotta admit the food made up for it. The other highlight was their orange beef. This is not your ordinary thin dry beef, it's actually crispy outside and juicy inside....We ended up going a second time before we left NY. Had to have the dumplings again, it's true what they say you will feel happy and in piece while you eat them.",1
"I will start by saying I do not think this place was worth the wait AT ALL. We waited approximately 45 minutes to go in.

LAYOUT

Like most places in chinatown this place is extremely packed and all the tables are close together. They have a ""family style"" seating arrangement. Expect to sit with others if you have a party of less than 9. 

PAYMENT

Cash only which sucks but, thats most of Chinatown.

SERVICE

Because they are so busy they rush you out which I'm not a fan of. It takes the waiter a while to come back around but they are relatively attentive. 

FOOD

The food is pretty good. Nothing crazy or out of this world but its definitely fresh. What i like the most is the fact that you can order things that are not on the menu. I wanted chicken and broccoli and for some reason it wasn't on the menu, but they made it anyway. They also have gluten free choices including noodles which was helpful since my baby cousin is allergic to gluten. 

Overall, I would recommend if there was no line",1
"**CASH ONLY**

Location: On Pell St, it looks small on the outside but the inside is packed.

Service: They have service doooown. It's packed, but they're so incredibly efficient and you're never really waiting for anything.

Food: Of course, the dumplings. Yes, they are incredible. Some of the biggest XLB I've ever had - and the juiciest. Scallion pancakes were okay, a little too thick in my opinion. The chicken fried rice was also amazing!",1
Good soup dupplings. Xiaolongbao!!!,1
"Soup dumplings and fried rice are good. Everything else on the menu was lacking, especially the beef noodle soup.",1
"Best dumplings I've ever had. A place I went to the last time I was here in New York from California. I couldn't stop talking about it and couldn't wait to get back to New York and take my friends. It's a pretty tiny place and it gets a little crowded. You have to share tables with other people. That was fine I guess. The wait was rather long, But with more than 5000 reviews. All I can say is they need to expand.",1
"Famous. This is the one word that's used to describe this place. There are a countless amount of celebrities that have been here and there's a reason for it. Come with a group for sure. This is the type of place that you order a number of plates and share within your group. You HAVE to get the dumplings. There is no way you cannot come here and not order the dumplings. It's what they are famous for. There's 150+ items on the menu to order so I'll drop se suggestions. On top of the dumplings, the sesame chicken is also good, the crispy duck was amazing, highly recommend it. Pork fried rice is a fantastic side dish to have. The quality of the food is a notch above your typical Chinese take out and it's always a good time to come with friends to Joe's. I will definitely be back.",1
"was visitng from out of town, and met up with friends who insisted on going here for dinner.  I was very skeptical on what a soup-dumpling would be like (the dish that this restaurant is famous for), but I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty they were.  We ordered the crab and pork dumplings, plus scallion pancakes and (I think) turnip rolls.  All were excellent.  It was crowded but the service was prompt.  Will definitely stop in again next time I'm in town.",1
"This place is great. It's not fancy at all, but if you are just looking to sit down and have some tea, dumplings, and soup then this is a good place to go. I felt like I was in Hong Kong again.",1
"I just died and went to xiao long bao heaven. One can never eat here and not try the soup dumpling--both pork and crab plus pork! I can sit and finish two servings under 15 minutes. Beware: portions of almost everything in the menu are good for at least two people. So you better be hungry and ready when you feel like dining in here. Cash only, can stay long or servers give you ""the look"", you get to share a table with strangers (which i always find awkwardly exciting).",1
"Fun Fact: xiao long bao = soup dumplings. Joe's shanghai dumplings are hand-made, made to order, and slightly bigger than a golf ball. It is a must here! 
-
Located in Chinatown @ 46 Bowery, New York, this restaurant serves Shanghainese cuisine and is known for their soup dumplings. 

Expect a wait at all hours of any day, also know that they usually call you earlier than expected. You get a ticketed number. We were quoted 40-45 min and came back at 30 min and our number had already been called. This seemed to be the case for many. I highly recommend the OS NYC Arcade Bar next door for a drink and games as a great waiting spot! 

They have a very extensive menu, and therefore something for everyone! From apps to main dishes, chef recommendations, noodles, fried rice, and all kinds of meats and vegetables. desserts - there is a whole lot of savory and some sweet for your palette. 

I highly recommend trying their Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) and ordering those to start for the table. I tried the pork ones (they also have crab and pork+ crab). Imagine a dumpling larger than the size of a golf ball, filled with fresh minced meat and juicy broth seamed in a traditional bamboo steamer to keep the juices inside the soup dumplings moist. 

 WARNING for new soup dumpling eaters: do put put the whole soup dumpling in your mouth when it comes to your table. The broth is most likely HOT and it might burn your mouth. This has been my favorite way: 
1) Put soy sauce and vinegar onto the plate with sliced ginger (this is your dipping sauce)
 2) Take the soup dumpling and dip it into the sauce.
3) Then put the dumpling into your spoon, and bite a TINY hole in the wrapper of the dumpling to either 1) release juices on spoon or 2) suck SOME of the juices out and then: 
4) Finally eat

I've had a lot of soup dumplings in my life and I would rate these a 4 out of a 5. They rock because they do not leak and are tasty, though I prefer a less fattier broth and thinner skin. 

I also got to try the vegetable lo mein and that was VERY good - a strong wok essence which I love - and the vegetables were a mix of both Asian and American Vegetables. 

Service was quick - it felt very rushed as they were trying to get people in and out. The table were very crowded - and would have preferred given the COVID world, if the tables were a bit further apart. The tables left, right and to the top and bottom of us were all within a feet apart.  The lady manning the front and handling the wait and getting people in whilst also manning telephone and to-go orders did a fantastic job - quite the multi-tasker! 

All in all,  I had a great experience here!",1
The crispy beef is PHENOMENAL! The service is great and they have great pork soup dumplings! Best place to eat in Chinatown!,1
"Absolutely amazing food. Like everyone else says, the soup dumplings are delicious and juicy, with tons of flavor and soup! Only downside is that service can be a little slow since the restaurant is so popular and servers may seem a little impatient.",1
"The soup dumplings were hot, fresh, and delicious. My young son devoured his chicken dish (recommended by server but don't remember the name). The service was incredible! Didn't have to ask for anything, the servers are positioned throughout the restaurant watching their tables for anything that might be needed. I was there on a Monday during the holiday break and arrived about 30 min after opening. Got a table right away and ordered food before our coats were off. Turned out to be perfect timing - 10 min after arriving there was a line out the door and around the corner!",1
"I really liked this place. I was in town for work and heard about Joe's Shanghai from a friend. 

When we got there there was a bit of a line, but it only took about 5 minutes to get a table. Some complain about communal tables, but that's an authentic touch too. They have ""private"" or single party tables too. We didn't have to deal with it because we had a pretty big group, so we took a whole table. The service was pretty on point. As we sat down the waiter said ""Dumplings? Tsingtao?"" Exactly what we were looking for to start the meal. 

As dinner progressed, the staff there was very very helpful. We just wanted some of the best on the menu and they kept it coming. I can't say there was a weak dish. Everything we had was pretty much amazing. 

Definitely try the dumplings, it's an experience, but give them a chance to cool before you dig in. Otherwise you're in for the burn of your life. The prawns were amazing too. 

I don't get the haterism. It's great chinese food. Pretty authentic if you ask me. I'll be making a stop on any trip to NYC.",1
"BEST DUMPLINGS EVER!!!! When I went to New York City for the first time me and my brother went to this place and loved it!! The food here it's reaaaaally great, then this second trip we really had to go and the flavor of the food was even greater!",1
"5 stars for everythings here.. I came with my teacher and my classmates (we were 11 peoples). They were pack already. We ordered Pork steam bun(my favorite) Pork fried and steam, pork fried rice, house fried rice, shrimp lo mein, fried chickens (I like it too) and some soup. Lucky us that 2 of my friends are Chinese. Service was fast...",1
"3 stars for the dumplings.

1 star for the creepy gross fish that i can't stop looking at.

and the last star because the neon hostesses make me feel like they're landing airplanes when they seat people.",1
"2 words! Soup Dumplings! Redunkulous! 5-stars for the DUMPLINGs alone.  The only other time or place I had these were at the infamous, Din Tai Fung in LA.  

They came in these large, circular steam baskets.  These dumplings were so big, you need a tong to grab them.  They do fit in your Asian porcelain soup spoon so that you can somewhat eat them correctly.  Once you bite into one, all those juicy flavors from the pork just oozes in your spoon.  At that point, you just want to slurp and keep biting away.  Savoring each bite.  I still think Din's is slightly better, but Joe's definitely gave them a run for their money.

Do not order anything outside the parameters of dumplings.  I regret ordering their fried rice which was super mediocre and possibly the worst I have had.  Two baskets (8 dumplings each) of these per person would suffice.  In fact, the waiter even ask you upfront if we came in to order just the dumplings, so thats a pretty big indication of its popularity.

Happy slurping!",1
"Good soup dumplings, although in my opinion it is not number 1 in the city. The soup dumplings here are juicy and satisfying, definitely worth a short wait if need be. Too bad it's a tourist trap now.",1
"Best soup dumpling anywhere. Better soup than ding tai fung. But line can be very long.
Recommended - soup dumpling (crab ones), orange beef, shanghai flat noodle, eggplant...I've never had a bad dish there.
PS - it's cash only",1
"We heard about this place from friends and so we stopped by after the US Open this past weekend.  The  pork Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumpling) was good, but not that big of a deal as folks hyped it to be.  The Bao was hot and tasty but the flavor was so so.  We expected more especially after reading about folks raving.  Not a full disappointment, we discovered that their cold cut combo (chicken in wine, & smoke fish) was very good.  BTW, the wait time is a little bit long.",1
"Fantastic!

My four kids (7-11) and their hungry parents had an unbelievable lunch here--ate like hungry wolves, of course downing several helpings of the famous dumplings, and shrimp noodle soup, and pan fried noodles.  All delicious!  And--all for $60 for the six of us!

We'll be back!",1
"Really good food, I wish I had known before it's cash only. Otherwise, definitely would recommend the soup dumplings. I think it gets really busy after work and on weekends.",1
"I absolutely love Joe's. The euphoric little soup dumplings are what you come here for. As soon as you sit down they ask you what kind you like (There are two, plain pork or pork with crab.) If you're a soup dumpling virgin then go for the plain pork, they're cheaper and just as orgasmic as the crabs. Please note that there is a lot of soup in the dumplings, don't just poke a hole in it and let the soup drain all over your plate! I saw someone do that yesterday and wanted to say something but... that would have been awkward...

The rest of the food here are typical to most other restaurants in the area, however, if you are tempted to order something else on the menu (or off) here are some items that I ALWAYS get:  1. ""Yang Chow Fried RIce"" It's chicken, pork, shrimp, egg and veggies fried rice without soysauce. 2. ""Beef Shanghai fat noodles"" I added that fat in there because I didn't know if there is a shanghai regular noodle. This dish also comes with spinach mixed in, it can also be very oily. 3. ""Orange Beef"" It's crispy saucey and spicy! And, the orange taste is not overpowering. 4. ""Braised Tofu with Spinach"" This dish is for you vegetarian lovers who think Joe's Shanghai isn't for you!! The description says it all.Also, this item is not on the menu, so you'll have to specifically ask for it.

This place is no glam, service has no frills and sometimes you bump elbows with a neighbor sharing your table that you don't even know (Let's face it, the wait is shorter like this). FYI, the workers in collared shirts are the waiters and the workers without are bus boys etc. So if you tell the bus boy, rather a worker in an uncollared shirt, your order chances are they'll give you a deer and headlights look and your order will never be placed.",1
"My niece came to visit from Georgia for a few days and Thursday was the only day I am off to take her out so in this blistering heat wave I  played a tourist guide!!  Also called my nephew to join us as he just migrated  here about 3 weeks ago and has really not been around yet.  We all took the subway and first stop was Ground Zero, St. Paul's Church where  most of the memorabilia from 9/11 was kept, Wall St area, Battery Park, where we watched a little nice entertainment then we did the Circle Line, Statue of Liberty to Ellis Island then we were ready for the Kill!! Food I mean!!

Ended up in Chinatown and I remember my daughter saying, ""Mom I don't care where we are going...just make sure there is  Air  Condition""  when I asked her what kind of cuisine she want, Vietnamese, Thai or Chinese Food .. so we all proceeded to Joe's Shanghai .where their Air Condition was to the max!!

In this sweltering heat I ordered the ""Soup Dumplings"", just wanted my guests to have a taste of their famous Xiao Long Bao!!  then we proceeded and ordered the  Noodles with Shrimps, Mix Vegetables with Seafood, Braised Beef with Noodles, and Diced Chicken & Shrimp in Plum Sauce.  As always, their food was extremely delicious.  Love Shanghai food, they certainly are a lot different from their Chinese counter parts like, Sichuan or Cantonese...they have this very distinct tasty flavor. This place is always full even though they don't accept credit cards...people still flock to eat here.....We went to  Mei Lei Wah for some delicious Siopao before proceeding to Times Square TGIF then home!!!  

Must have stayed in the bathroom for an hour to cool off!! NICE!!

Met with the rest of the gang at Times Square TGIFAfter",1
"We came here for a late lunch. It was pretty packed but we got seated right away. I think the pouring rain outside worked in our favor. I would normally get this place 3 stars because I don't think the soup dumplings were amazing. I actually prefer the ones in Arcadia better, however the jumbo prawn was amazing and so was the string beans! Yums! I was a bit annoyed that they take cash only, specially because I has to run out in the rain without an umbrella to find an ATM. Will I be back? Yes, for the prawns!",1
"If you are in New York's Chinatown and need a place to experience the best ever soup dumplings head over to Joe's Shanghai on Pell Street.  Amazing, fresh, hand-made daily little yummy parcels of pork and crab broth filled dumplings are to die for!  Just heave these and maybe some green beans or rice cakes as a side.  Be careful not to burn your mouth as the scalding hot broth escapes onto your spoon. You won't be disappointed! Expect a wait of up to an hour though but that's all part of the fun. Speak to your fellow devotee's as you wait to get inside. Cash only, no cards or debit.",1
"This is an updated review!

I always come here with a big group of my friends and we are never disappointed with the food. The consistency that this restaurant has with the flavour of its soup dumplings is great!

You have two choices for soup dumplings: pork and crab. Both are delicious, the crab is a little bit pricier. Aside from the dumplings, I recommend the pan-fried noodles because they are delicious! So are the scallion pancakes, tripe, and jellyfish. 

There are tables for everyone but if you are eating with a big group, there are big round tables in the back to accommodate big parties. This place is also CASH ONLY but a good think is that there's plenty of banks down the block and around the corners to withdraw money. 

Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!",1
"The food was good there, although wish it was more authentic. Can probably can more similar but authentic food in Flushing.",1
"The soup dumplings!!' WOW!! I'm still thinking about these days later. We did not try anything else but those were enough to really impress me! And I think we got 8 for $12 so very reasonable in price! We went on a Friday afternoon and it was still very busy, so I imagine the wait probably gets long during typical dining hours! So worth the visit! I would absolutely recommend to anyone visiting NYC!!!",1
"My first and second visit here were very different. The first time, the soup dumplings I had been hearing about for years were just 'meh' and the service was atrocious. We were a group of 7 loud ladies, so I decided to give it another shot, only this time as a party of 2. 

HOLY SOUP DUMPLINGS. I seriously think I was in a different restaurant all together. The soup dumplings were delicious and had tons of flavor, unlike my first visit where they were lacking in that department. Service was much better this time, probably because it wasn't an obnoxious large group. My only complaint was the waiter sneezed all over his hands right above our table, then reached for my water glass to refill it. KInda grossed me out a little, but definitely will not keep me from coming back for more soup dumplings!

We also ordered sesame beef and pan fried noodles with chicken. Both were large portions and very good, but the sesame beef was out of this world.",1
"Absolutely love this place. Hands down the best soup dumplings in town! When we talk about soup dumplings, I would give it a 10/10. When we're talking about an overall experience as a restaurant then I'd give it a 7.5. I do like the complimentary orange for dessert, but the place can improve on cleanliness.",1
Best soup dumplings in NYC. All the tourists know about it now which makes the line longer. Good thing I'm a regular so I don't have to wait!,1
"As my brother was going to NYU for grad school I would always come visit about once every other month and I COULD NOT leave NYC without getting the XLB from Joe's. 

The wait is long and sometimes (actually all the time) you have to share tables but its all worth it.


Din Tai Fung in LA cannot compare nor should anyone compare the two, Joe's Shanghai is simply that much better.",1
"I've never had Xiao Long Bao before so we decided to give Joe's a try after reading their good reviews.

We ordered the Pork Dumplings, Crispy Beef noodles and Hot and Sour soup. The dumplings were sooo juicy and flavorful and tasted really good while it's hot (we left a piece on the steamer and it did not taste quite as good anymore when it got cold). The dumpling skin was definitely not the ones that are sold for 99cents/pack at a 99 Ranch store. It was soft, chewy and held the soup in the dumplings very well.

The noodle dish was loaded with a lot of beef and broccoli, the Hot and Sour soup was just ok (I've had better).

We got there at 11am and by noon, the place was packed and there was already a long wait for a table. On our last night in town, we wanted to go back to Joe's but a huge crowd of about 30 people were already waiting outside indicating at least an hour wait so we decided to look for another place we can go to for dumplings.

If you want to try Joe's Xiao Long Bao, make sure to get there really early to avoid the crowd!",1
"If I could rate this 11/10- I WOULD!!! The food here was absolutely phenomenal. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, Shanghai noodles with pork, & the sesame chicken. The soup dumplings were so so good it tasted like wonton soup & the pork meat inside was cooked to perfection. The sesame chicken was so fresh & the white meat was plentiful. The Shanghai noodles were my favorite dish. They tasted like a thick doughy type of lo mein. 
I loved the food & the portions were very good. My friend and I shared each plate like a family style type of dinner. There was still leftovers once we finished. 
I can't wait to come back to joes Shanghai!
Also FYI- it's a CASH ONLY restaurant. They do have ATM's on site. Also, please expect to wait if you go here because it's very crowded! People were waiting outside in the cold so you know this place is worth it!!
As I left I told the people waiting that it's worth the wait, some people were laughing because I got food all over my shirt!!! You know the food is good when it's all over your shirt.  xD",1
"I feel like I don't need to elaborate on this review since it's been reviewed so many times.  All I want to say is that I feel like this place has better dumplings than Din Tai Fung.  These dumplings are packed with soup and juicy goodness, DTF's not so much.",1
This place has so far been the best of all the Chinese food places we have been! Only real down fall was sitting next to randoms. The beef broccoli was amazing! Not a huge fan of food like this so I can't complain that the rest was good or bad,1
"I've been to Shanghai before and have eaten a lot of xiao long baos, and I think this place has one of the best.  It's so good on a cold night and it's also pretty cheap.  We got the pork xiao long bao, shanghai chow mein, and a scallion pancake.. all soo good.  There was a long wait for dinner, but since it's in chinatown, you can walk around and explore some fun shops. 

There's another place near this restaurant that's called Joe's as well, so make sure you go to right one (Joe's Shanghai has a green canopy thing).",1
"i love a place where the waiters remember me and take the time to wave hello.  and well, these guys probably know me because i think i used to come here almost once a week.  and ordered pretty much the same thing, depending on group size:  soup dumplings (pork), scallion pancakes, beef with green beans, chicken pan fried noodles (or rice cakes), chicken and cucumber with hot peppers, braised tofu and snow pea shoots (off-menu).  and so it's kinda like how norm or cliff must have felt at/on ""cheers"", only these guys don't necessarily know my name.

best to go during off hours or bring a book (or ipad) to read while you wait for your number to get called for a table.",1
"Only tried the soup dumplings and Shanghai noodles.  Both were good as advertised.  Restaurant was very busy and we got lucky because we were a large party and they happened to have a large table available when we put our names down.  Otherwise, I imagine the wait would have been 45 minutes or more.",1
"Dumpling goodness! My girlfriend and I went to this place because of their mouth watering Soup Dumplings. First and foremost the ambiance was packed; we're even seated next to 2 parties. It is weird to do it this way since we're seated with people that we don't know, but thats how you get seated as soon as possible. Like, ""Yo whatchu you ordered stranger?"" Lol. Yeah most foreigners or Non-Asian might complain, but thats how they do it in Chinatown lol. Nevertheless, the service was fast and efficient.. really good customer service for a busy place.. really impressive Anyway.... the food!

Yeap we came here just to order their Soup Dumplings :) We ate a lot from other places since we're in NYC Chinatown, afterall. The Soup Dumplings are one of the best dumplings I ever eaten. It is so unique that few Chinese restaurant have it on their menu. The soup is a little salty or even fishy, like a lobster flavor. Although, it is consist of pork; more flavors are packed in one bite. It really felt like I am eating this in China; never been to China, but thats how I imagine it to be. Its outrageously good and I really recommend trying it, when visiting NYC Chinatown. Overall, heck yeah gonna go here again and might order 4 to 5 orders in one seating.. dead a** lol :)",1
"Soup dumplings were good and lived up to expectations!
Don't expect much in terms of frills - this is a bare bones type of establishment.",1
"You really cannot get much better than dim sum at Joe's. Note that it is cash only and 15% tip is included! Sometimes the wait is nuts, but often it isn't as bad as the crowd outside would appear. The pork soup dumplings are mouth watering. I've also tried and liked the orange chicken, beef fried rice, general tsos duo, and lo mein.",1
Best steamed dumpling i ever tried! Place is so tiny though. You share table with others,1
"Two words. SOUP. DUMPLINGS. 

First of all let me say that going to Chinatown for Chinese intimidates the hell out of me - how do you know what place are the best?! Ah! 

An old colleague of mine suggested that we do Chinese for lunch the other day and said his favorite place was in Chinatown...SO I put my ""brave face"" on and headed down to meet him.  

He says: 
""We have to order the soup dumplings...the soup is INSIDE the dumpling!""

I say:
""INSIDE the dumpling?""

He says:
""Yes, INSIDE the dumpling...""

It all reminded me of the scene from 16 Candles when Long Duk Dong is explaining to Jake Ryan about Sam being at the church to get married...haha!

Anyhow, within the walls of this communal-seating-Chinatown-oasis I discovered the art of eating these soup filled dumplings...  When the dumplings are brought to the table, you need to place the dumpling into your soup spoon.  Then you need to nibble the tiniest little hole into the top of the dumpling so that you can slurp the soup out of the dumpling, then you can stretch out that hole little more to allow a spot for you to pour in a spoonful of the soy sauce/vinegar/ginger mixture on the table.  Then you can finish the dumpling in about 2-3 bites.  

They are DELICIOUS - we got the crab & pork dumplings which I highly recommend!!  We also ordered the General Tso's Chicken and the Dry Shredded Beef which were both awesome as well.  It was definitely some of the best Chinese I've had in New York!",1
"Delicious, well-made, no frills soup dumplings. A bit heartier and bigger than that of the also well known Din Tai Fung. Cash only, quick in and quick out kind of place. Be prepared ahead of time! They rush you a bit there, but for a place that is so busy you'll be glad they did the same for those ahead of you! Beware of cash only and 15% gratuity included already.",1
"The Peking Duck was so delicious. Delicious sauce, crispy skin, fluffy bread and scallions make it complete. The only small improvement could be if the duck were a bit more tender. Service is fast and nice. Very very good and would eat here again.",1
"Came in on a Tuesday afternoon and it was not busy.
Service was like any other, but food was amazing ! And cheap. Of course we got the dim sum. All food was good.",1
"This is by far one of my favorite xiao long bao place's...one bite into the crab dumpling...juices pour out onto your spoon...like a little bundle of rich broth just waiting to erupt...(beware very hott!!)

Beware of wait time...",1
Everytime I go to NY i always have to stop by. Definitely need to check a few other places out but its sooooo good here. I never really had to wait too long so I cant complain. I always over order and get like 4 plates of soup dumplings betweenn me and my wife but I dont regret it. Get the pork. The other ones are whattever. So good especially when its cold!,1
"Clearly,  a few people know about Joe's Shanghai down the little alley on Pell street.  It's a virtual cornucopia of international tourists and locals that ate not Chinese.  Usually that would be a bad thing, but this place is very good.  We enjoyed the Crispy Duck (a little dry and salty), Shanghai rice and the infamous dumplings with crab & pork.  These were down right tasty.  When I asked the waiter what they were famous for, he pointed right at it.  Out of the thousands of photos posted on Yelp! For Joe's, at least half are the same photo of these tasty dumplings.  Don't forget to eat these if you come to Joe's.  It's nice to be somewhere warm and packed on a cold New York night with a nor-easter bearing  down in the next couple hours.  We can be trapped indoors with warm bellies while we hibernate.",1
"As recommended by the Fung Bros, I found this spot a classic for Dim Sum. While in New York, my buddy and I wanted a taste of home and decided to scope out Chinatown. We ordered about half the menu and ended up finishing everything! The food came out within seconds and it was authentic, delicious with decent portions!",1
"My first xiao long bao experience was at Joe's Shanghai back in October 2002 when my friend and I took a trip to NY.  Ever since then I've been searching for something similar in CA but still haven't found one.  Din Tai Fung is close but not quite.  Joe's is juicier and has a super thin skin (almost like a water balloon).  Only problem is the skin can break easily because it's so thin.  I went back three years ago and it was still as good as my original experience.

Service is so so and not too fond of the communal tables.  If you are a private person I don't recommend you come here.

There's another location in Midtown (around corner of 56th & 5th) that is clean and doesn't have communal tables, but for some reason it doesn't taste as good.  I think it's the grime that adds charm and flavor at this location.

They have other dishes too but they weren't that memorable.

CASH ONLY and there's usually a long wait on weekends.",1
"whoa whoa whoa! 
that was an explosion of yummy in my mouth... literally. 
(please note that this was my first time ever eating these...)

My friend had told me about this place their Shanghai-nese dumplings... I was skeptical and rather confused.

The place is a staple of ChinaTown in NYC. They're very busy even on the rainy day that I passed through. 

Quickly seated with some random strangers - I suppose that's more efficient than having a bunch of small and large tables. I just asked for the dumplings and water. After all, this is NYC - there's more food to be eaten elsewhere.

Service was quick and before you knew a bamboo steamer appears before you with some ""soupy dumplings""... I believe you get about 8 per order. 

Supposedly there's a proper way of eating these (by piercing the skin and sucking out the soup), but that's not fun. I just plop them straight in and munch. But watch out! The first few will burn your tongue!

I'm sure prices vary, but I chose pork and it was about $4.75 + tax + tip. Do note that they'll automatically add 15% tip for you... AND it's cash only!

Besides those two annoyances, yummy! I'd go back for more~",1
"The soup dumplings are good but by far, Shanghai Cafe has the BEST soup dumplings out there! Skip the crazy lines of all the tourists who don't know any better. Check out the other gems of Chinatown and not fall for this tourist trap!",1
"Wonderful food and experience. Line was out the door on a cold Saturday afternoon for lunch, but the 30 minute wait was worth it. They use every inch of the place, no space wasted. We were sat at a round 6 top with 2 other couples, even so we still felt like we had our own space to enjoy our time together. 
Our waiter was very attentive and helpful, teaching us the right way to eat the crab and pork bun, so delicious. 
Cash only and tip included in price, although only 15%.",1
"They're a little too expensive compared to other soup dumplings around town but very good, fresh, piping hot burn in your mouth dumplings!! Also it was weird being seated in a large round table with 3 other parties in the same table! But I'd get the soup dumplings, the general tso/sesame chicken was regular tasting.",1
Amazing amazing soup dumplings. The pan fried noodles was very good as well. We had a little awkward situation while sharing the table but the manager was very sweet and put us at another table.,1
Soup dumplings are probably my favorite food and I have to say these are some of the best I've ever had! The rest of the food I got was equally delicious.,1
Wow. Incredible dumplings and Shanghai noodles are really special. Worth the hype! Prepare for an epic food coma afterwards though.,1
"It's crazy busy but we didn't wait long, they combine small party's on a big table, so it makes for good conversation.  I love general joes chicken and there's was ok, the fried rice was ok also we got the chicken but not a lot of chicken in it. 

I will say we enjoyed the pork dumplings were awesome! We would have just orders two orders  and maybe one order of general joes!

All in all there were a lot of Asian people eating there which is a good sign for a Asian restaurant!",1
Came here with a large group (8) and was seated immediately. The soup dumplings and crispy fried shrimp here is a must try! The service here is always super fast and friendly. All the portions here are family style. This is also a cash only please. Not sure if they are under new management because their menu says a different name but the food is still the same.,1
"Word Of The Day ""Soup Dumplings"".
Thats pretty much all about Joe's Shanghai.
I have visited their Mid Town location the this particular one and none failed on the Dumpling THE BEST. Rest of the menu is pretty mediocre nothing out of the ordinary your sameOl sameOl Chinese Food. I mostly have my fill on the dumplings. The other dish that impresses me is the Fried Noodles the dish starts out with crispy fried noodles with your regular stir fry ingredients but a bit saucy in the center so as you eat your way in you go from crispy to soft a good play on textures.
Only drawback Cash Only and 20-30 min waits always.
FYI - There is NO wait for parties with pregnant ladies and preference for parties with toddlers.",1
"My boyfriend kept raving about this place and this time around when I went to visit him we had to go. We waited for about 45 mins because this restaurant does not take reservations.  It's first come first serve. 

It's a small hole in the wall Chinese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. This place only accepts cash. We were put at a community table with 2 other groups. The place is very fast pace and has a family feel to it. 

The service is fast and easy. Food came out hot and quickly. The food was worth the wait. The soup dumplings with pork filling were to die for. They were a great balance of sweet and sour. We ordered Kung pao chicken, general tso chicken, young chow fried rice, and vegetable chowmein. All the dishes were excellent and cooked exactly how they needed to be. 

It's a must try Chinese restaurant especially for the dumplings.",1
"Great food, love the new location. I live in the neighborhood and this is a great place to take friends and family who are visiting. The new location is super polished and the food is always great! If you're familiar with Chinatown prices, this may seem pricier to you, but it's absolutely worth it!",1
"Best xiao long bao I've had in a while.. Although it doesn't beat Din Tai Fung it's comparable. It oozes with flavorful broth and is quite delicious. 

We were seated at a large round table with 2 other parties, which some might find  awkward, but it can be standard at some Chinese restaurants. 

Besides the regular xiao long bao, we also had the one with crab meat, scallion pancakes, fried rice, and egg rolls. I didn't try the egg rolls, but my friends said it was a little too oily so I wouldn't recommend it. Everything else was delicious! 

The only downside to this place, is that it's cash only. Our bill came out to $43 for 3 people so it was a pretty cheap and satisfying first dinner in New York.",1
Fantastic spicy calamari in black bean sauce and steamed dumplings!!!,1
The crab & pork soup dumplings are simply the best in the US! Worth every second of the hour + wait outside. There would still be an hour wait if they only had those 2 things on the menu! G.O.A.T.!!!,1
"One of the best soup dumplings I have tried. We ordered three trays one pork, and two crab combo. Eat them while they are hot or they soup will conjeal back to a solid. Come early or share a table with others it will get crowded fast. The dumplings are large packed with meat and soup. The top of the dumpling was a little doughy and I prefer the pork over the crab.",1
"Tried the Crab & Pork Soup Dumplings, Pork Soup Dumplings, Sesame Noodles and not sure of the name of the dish of vegetables we ordered...tong cai in Chinese? 

8 large dumplings for a fairly good price ($6.95). FYI the location in Chinatown is cheaper than the uptown location. 

Sesame Noodles are pretty good - very simple, but flavorful. 

The restaurant started to get really busy around 6:30/7 p.m; we went on a Monday and a bit earlier and didn't have to wait.",1
Soup dumplings of course!!! Fried rice is great as well! Fast and friendly servers prepared to take care of even the most needy guests. Definitely trying the whole fried fish next time as it seemed to be on a lot of tables around me. Can't wait to come back this place is awesome,1
"One of my favorite foods happens to be soup dumplings, so of course I had to try this place when I came to NYC.

It was a Saturday afternoon around 1pm and there was a wait and line outside the door. For two people, it was a 20 minute wait, which isn't so bad considering it's a small restaurant. When we got seated, I realized they sat us at a half-circular table against the wall meant for 5 people where a 3 person party was already seated--meaning we had to share a table with strangers. The other guests weren't bothersome, so we didn't mind.

We ordered the pork soup dumplings ($8) and the crab & pork soup dumplings ($11) first. Compared to the famed Din Tai Fung, these dumplings are about 2-3 times bigger in size, and it came with 7 dumplings. It was a bit difficult and messy to eat due to the dumpling size being so huge, but it was sooo good! Although some of the crab ones kept popping as we picked it up from it's tray, so that was pretty disappointing. We also ordered the sautéed shredded beef with jalapeños ($16). Another great choice! They didn't bring us any rice, so I suppose you have to order it on the side and pay extra, but we were too full to even bother with it.

The service was a bit awkward, as this is a genuine Chinese restaurant and the servers can barely speak English. I often found our server standing a foot or two behind us and staring, as if waiting for us to call on him. Overall, quick and friendly service.

Definitely would recommend if you don't mind waiting and/or sharing tables!!",1
"I absolutely loved Joe's Shanghai, I had some of the tastiest dumplings there! The first set of steamed goodness came in a basket with 7 soupy, hot and full of pork flavor, dumplings. 
The second basket was filled with crab meat soup dumplings, equally delicious! 
If you enjoy dumplings, you need to try these for sure. The restaurant is packed but efficient, you'll be sitting with other people on your table, but that's the fun of this type of seating arrangements. You get to know people in the process while enjoying food. They had many offerings on the menu but I can for the dumplings. 
Get there early, there's usually a wait... but it's worth it. 
Now go enjoy!",1
"These are the BEST dumplings in town! The soup dumplings melt in your mouth instantaneously and the pop of flavor is dreamy! I ate so much I almost exploded but it was so worth it. I am already dreaming about going back. Tip: Go on off hours. I went relatively early and there was no wait. I once tried to get in at peak dinner hours and the wait was an hour. I didn't stick around

Don't forget to stop right on the corner. They have an unreal dried fruit and meat and fish store! It's like a unique candy store. I highly recommend stocking up on dried kiwi's and ginger! Try some of the dried fish to!!!",1
"I've been wanting to try soup dumplings for a long time so it was awesome to finally get some at Joe's Shanghai! The restaurant in China Town is surrounded by a ton of other hole in the wall restaurants that all appear to be the same, but Joe's was the only restaurant with a long wait, which was a good sign. 
I was seated at a round table that another family was already seated at, which was a bit odd/awkward. I enjoyed the fresh tea kettle that was set on the table when we sat down. We started with an order of pork soup dumplings, which were rich in pork flavor and very filling. I tremendously enjoyed them, but we also got Shanghai Noodles that we're a bit bland and soaked in oil. The noodles would benefit from some teriyaki and spice. 
10/10 recommend visiting just to try soup dumplings!",1
"We went to Joe Shanghai for 1 thing and 1 thing only: xiao long bao. There always seems to be a line in front but this time we were determined to eat here. You have to go to the lady in front to get a number and then you wait outside until she calls your number for you to be seated. If you have some time to kill, there's a bubble tea store right next door. They were doing buy 1 get 1 free (or 50% off) boba but I'm not sure if that's always the case.  

We were seated fairly quickly and immediately told our waiter that we wanted 3 racks of pork xiao long bao. We also got an order of sesame noodles which were super sesame/peanut buttery just how we like and an order of green beans. The green beans were over salted and were a little friends instead of cooked in oil and garlic like we were used to. However that's not the point, the point was that the xiao long bao were delicious and filled with TONS of soup. Be careful for your first bite because you don't realize 1) how much soup there is in these things 2) how hot they come out from the kitchen. 

If you go on their website, there's a funny video about how to eat them and how not to eat them. As cute as the video is, it doesn't compare to how delicious the soup dumplings are.",1
"Great find! Food was really good, really fast, really fresh. The wait might be long during the normal meal times. We (party of 4)went on a Saturday at 3 and waited 40 minutes. It's family style seating so fun to meet other people from other places. They are know for their soup dumplings. Delicious!!! Also ordered scallion pancake and sesame chicken. Yum! Cash only but there's an atm right at the entrance. Visiting from California and wish we had this in our town.",1
"This is a must visit for a delicious, quick meal in Chinatown. We weren't starving, so all we ordered were the pork soup dumplings. The dumplings were not only absolutely delicious, but they also were larger than expected and came with 8 to an order. This could be a meal in itself for someone who came hungry! The service is fast and efficient, you will have a wait time but the staff is quick to get people in & out so that you can enjoy your meal. Joe's is a great place!",1
"I've been living in New York City for 30 years and I can tell you that Joe shanghai has the best Chinese food. I have been going with my family to the one on 54th St. it has been the best food every time that I go there and the service is good as well. We were stuck in the rain downtown and for the first time today we went to the Joe Shanghai downtown. The food was still the best. However, before you go to this one downtown you have to know that they will seat you wherever they want and there is a 50-50 chance that you're going to be sharing a table with other patrons. If your social person you won't mind. The other thing is that they absolutely only except cash. Do not go there unless you have more than enough cash otherwise you might be embarrassed not be able to pay the bill. The different dishes are about 4 to 5 dollars less than the one uptown, but the one uptown you can use your credit card. So you don't have to worry during the meal if you have enough money to pay for it. I will Continue frequent Joe Shanghai often but I will stick with the one uptown. Also remember that both uptown and downtown during the prime hours of lunch and dinner there is a half an hour to one hour wait time. So go off hours and you have the best of both worlds, little wait time and the best Chinese food you ever had.",1
"Delicious food! Fast service! Well priced!  At a non standard meal time the restaurant was full when (with lots of locals as well as tourists) every other restaurant within 5 blocks had no more then 3 tables. One thing to note is it is cash only, and a little hard to find.",1
"I love Joe's, but I think that Shanghai Asian Manor's soup dumplings are slightly better. Joe's are definitely good, but it's also super popular due to the fact that it was the first soup dumpling place in Manhattan.",1
Everything I could ever want or dream in a dumpling. They got us in an out quickly and took great care of each customer,1
"Yum, yum, yum.  The dumplings are fantastic!  

Try to go with a big group - it's much more fun to order and share a bunch of different stuff, and it seems like they rush you less if you're taking up a whole table yourself.    

It's a little cramped and loud, but that's part of the fun of this place!",1
Shanghai dumplings..mmmmm 2nd time here since my last visit to NYC.,1
"SOUP DUMPLINGS! 
It was so crowded when I went and they don't take reservations for groups smaller than 10. I suggest getting 9 of your closest friends and making a reservation. Everything is giant and family style so that seems to be the most fun way to experience Joe's anyway. 
I prefer just the pork to the pork and crab (I may be the minority on this one). But I will eat any soup dumpling that is put before me at Joe's!!!!
AND cheap 2 of us got an order of soup dumplings each and some fried rice and it was 20 dollars TOTAL! Hooray!!!!",1
"Best Chinese food Ive ever had! I was very lucky and came on a day that they weren't super busy. Only took me 5 min to be seated, but be aware wait time cane be high. They do turn people in and out quickly but not in a rude rushed way. The soupy dumplings are a must and both are to die for and apparently as legit as it gets without having to travel across the globe. I also tried staple items as the sesame chicken and main, the best, as well ad the crispy duck, and chicken in plum sauce. This is a place liked by locals and tourists alike which always a food sign. The prices are standard aprox 15-20 per plate.",1
"The first time I ever went here was with my boyfriend at the time who was half chinese and his mom was his biggest food influence. So I knew that waiting for a while it was really worth it. All I knew about Joe's Shanghai  is that they were famous for their Soup Dumplings. I had no idea what that meant but I was really excited to try it. Let's just say after eating the Pork Dumplings I was sold. I have taken MANY MANY people to this restaurant after eating there. 

When I go to Joe's I always order 2 orders of Pork Soup Dumplings which come in  5's.The crab dumplings are aight but not really my thang. I order the chicken Rice Cakes which are amazing. It basically is chopped up chicken with these little quarter sized rice cakes which are soft and goes so well with the chicken and then they throw in some bak choy. I also order they're tofu the bean curd and veggies. Mmmm... the taste is like nothing i've had. The tofu is fried and then its doused in sauce and veggies. by this time  i'm a big fat lard that can't move... 

Some things that suck about Joe's is the wait and having to sit with people that you don't know. But after a few Tsing Tao (chinese beer that is also good) you start making friends and forgetting that you're having dinner with a bunch of people you don't know. Also, they add in their own tip but all they have are these little signs on the wall stating that. So if you weren't paying attention you're giving them way more than you should. 

After living in China for a year and coming back this food is as  close to ""real chinese"" food that i can have. I suggest that people definitely try it out. Don't forget CASH ONLY!!",1
"Whenever I travel to NY, I always make time to dine here. Their soup dumplings are that good! Their service can be a bit rushed, which is good since I know what I want....This place can get so crowded - I appreciate the fast turn over!",1
"Best soup dumplings I have ever had.  Honestly, I have tried and tried to replicate their taste by ordering them at other restaurants, and I have never been able to.  The best!  Pork and Crab are the way to go.  JUST DO IT.",1
"Another gem in Chinatown that you'll be lucky to stumble upon. I only hear of great places to eat in Chinatown from friends, not necessarily because I walked into a random restaurant in Chinatown and it turned out to be good. Nope! If you're planning to eat in the Chinatown, you need some recommendations or you should refer to yelp! Anyways, my friends took be here because of their craving for soup dumplings. What are soup dumplings exactly? Well, it's what they sound like.

I can into this place thinking that I will be eating dumplings in soup. You know, like wonton style? Nope. I was wrong. We order 4 orders (one order each) of soup dumplings that comes with 8. Yes, our eyes were bigger than our stomach. We got two orders of the pork soup dumplings and two orders of the crab and pork soup dumplings. On top of that, we ordered a place of broccoli and beef and a plate of pan fried noodles that had beef. Boy did we stuff ourselves that night. I'm surprised the waiter didn't look at us like we were crazy...

The soup dumplings were deelish. They were kind of hard to eat. There is a technique to eat them. You have to carefully pick them up from the steam tray and place it on your soup spoon. The you have to poke a hole in the wrapper so the soup will spill out slowly. Then you sip the soup and SLOWLY devour the dumpling. WARNING, it is mostly likely you will burn your tongue! The pork dumplings had a different flavor/soup from the pork and crab dumpling. They were both really good! I think I prefer the pork and crab one more. The broccoli and beer was okay. Super flavorful and slathered with sauce, just the way chinese people like to eat your veggies. The pan fried noodles were pretty good. The noodles were rice noodles I believe, kind of looked like udon but pan fried with veggies and beef. Very flavorful and yummy. I liked it. I could have done without the broccoli and beef. 

All in all the place was good. Service is very ""chinatown."" You know what I mean. Fast pace, gotta wave them down, pressures you to order fast and get you to leave fast. Yeah. That's how it was. But if you move past the service, the food is good. If you're small party, you will probably sit at a huge round table with random people. That's legit Chinatown style. Ha!",1
"My favorite joint for shanghai dumplings! I'm hungry again just thinking about the broth that spills out of the dumpling as you take a bite into the dumpling skin that is neither too thick or thin. When I come here, that's all I want, an order of their shanghai dumplings. I'd also get an order of them spring beans, perfectly fried and stir fried with garlic and soy sauce into the perfect crunch when you bite into it. It's a crowded restaurant and you'll be sharing the table with others, but worth it! So get cozy with your new friends at the table and just enjoy!",1
We got the pork meat soup dumplings and Szechuan beef noodle soup.  The food was delicious!,1
Love this place! Tucked away in Chinatown is this gem. We went for the dumplings and were not disappointed! This place can get pretty packed but they seem well-staffed and can handle the rushes. We got the mixed pork and crab dumplings. They literally fell apart! The main dishes were fine too but the dumplings stole the show. Check it out if you're in NY!,1
Delicious. Love going there with my wife and kids. The kids adore the place and the food.,1
"Very testy food , makes me back to the home already, we will back again if we have time in the New York City",1
"Really good dumplings, also the turnip shortcake and the duck was really good crispy.",1
"One of Chinatown's great attractions!

Last night the dude and I were restless and hungry and very happy to live near Chinatown so we hit up joes for some soup dumplings.

If you don't already know, they're awesome here. If you don't order anything else, get some of those.

Communal seating and classic Chinatown environment (don't expect to be waited on hand and foot but service is friendly and perfunctionary if a bit rushed-after all, there's always at least some wait here) reminded me of my visit to Hong Kong. 

Definitely a NYC favorite of mine.",1
"HARD TO FIND

prepare for a wait, even though it was short and know what you want to order our waiter didn't have time or energy to answer any questions or give suggestions

thanks to you guys I ordered the pancake which was the best I have ever tried in my life, the dumplings burst w/a liquid once bitten so be careful (they were alright)",1
"Pretty good but one could argue that there's lesser known options that have higher quality for less money. But always a solid choice if you don't want to make too much effort. It's like thinking Olive Garden was the best restaurant ever when you were 13 - you don't know anything else. Or maybe that's just me , honestly Olive Garden is . Joes is the Olive Garden of Dumplings.",1
"Your in China Town....Joe takes you to Shanghai, China...it's busy, but not crazy yet. The two of us are three back from being called to the ""Diners Table"". But, they call ""six"" of us up and suddenly your transported to China...you sit at a large round table sitting all parties. A printed letter of the English (you think) alphabet is placed in front of each group. No one converses with any ""outsiders"". It's as if you are sitting at a private table, but it's not private. The menu looks like it's written in a different language. The English writing seems foreign to you. You choose two cups of sake, a Szechuan Beef and a Shrimp Lo-Mein. The beef is tender medium rare perfectly cooked. The beef is in a Szechuan sauce most delicious (Gen.Tso married to Miss Hoisin..:). Our Sake was delivered in small odd looking bottles. But this Sake very good!!!..:) The Shrimp Lo Mein was tasty; The shrimps though smaller than desired, were accompanied by crispy delicious bean sprouts. Waiters come at you like Ninja Warriors, seeming to drop in and out of sight from the ceiling..:) We had plenty of leftovers to take back to our Temporary Villa. Oranges brighten the end of this fun meal. As you leave somewhere near 7pm, you see the crowd of people (many Asian) waiting with great humility (humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of yourself less.""..:) to be called to the Round Table. Thanks for reading.

"Best soup dumpling I ever have...hands down. 

Everything else is just so-so.",1
Had seen this restaurant and heard about the good food so decided to try it. The line was out the door but the wait wasn't too long  and I can see why the staff is very helpful and the food is delicious very good flavor and portions we had the chicken lo mein and Kung pao chicken with a side of scallion fried rice the portions are generous and full of flavor would definitely go back when I'm in my,1
"Crab pork soup dumplings: wow. The best Shanghai dumplings aka XLB I have ever had! The soup inside had a great flavor and a nice, thickened consistency and the dumpling skin was nice and chewy. The entire thing was a delicious bite, and a very generous bite at that! 8 pieces of this one was approximately $11, which I felt was a deal. 

There is a little alley way to the right of the front door to the restaurant where there is some seating to enjoy the food. 

Highly recommended!",1
"Soup dumplings!! Joe makes the best in the city. Whenever I have a craving I have to order from here. They are always perfect. Get the pork stuffed, divine!!",1
"This restaurant its a regular stop for us, everytime we go to NY city. We had the crabmeat dumplings. The waiter showed us the proper way to eat dumplings. They were delicious. We will definitely come here again.",1
"This is where my friends and I go for a SNACK.

Wait a bit, dodge people coming in and out.

Get smacked in the face with a door.

Share a table with a Chinese woman and her freaking adorable Grandmother (who can house an entire tower of soup dumplings, by the way.)

Order the pork soup dumplings and the pork and crab. Enjoy the complimentary hot tea on the table. Pay like, 14 dollars (tip is included already!).

Vamoose.

Snack time at Joe's Shanghai.",1
"Soup dumplings - good; other Chinese food - good; space available to sit and configuration - really, really tight.

Don't miss Joe's Shanghai if you love soup dumplings.  They do have the best in the city.",1
"Health Grade: A

I've been here many times - mostly with friends/family who visit. I will admit, we never really order anything else besides for the soup dumplings, but they are definitely the reason I come back over and over. They're piping hot when you get them and delicious. I've had both the pork and crab, and they're both good.",1
"I dream of the pork soup dumplings!!!  Best I've ever had!  

This place is so much fun and chaotic!  Bustling interior.  Be prepared to literally knock into some strangers and start up a conversation.  Unless you have a huge party you'll be seated at large tables where you (can) share food with people you've never met (or just talk, but keep the food to yourself).  Everyone is just thrown into this melting pot of a place so it's easy to be chatty and even walk out with a new friend or two.",1
Hand down the best xiao long bao I've never had. I'm willing to wait in line for this place. But it's super small and the tables are crammed against each other. The meat inside is decent sized. The dough isn't too thick to chew and not too thin where it'll pop when you pick it up.,1
"Amazing dumplings - both pork and crab+pork! Succulent beef+broccoli, awesome noodle soup - best we've had in years!",1
"fun fact about their soup dumplings: most places use a piece of wax paper on the bottom of the steamer, you know, like normal dim sum dishes. but the thing is, these dumplings are so delicate that when you pick one up, the bottom of the dumpling usually sticks to the paper, and the force of the lifting tears the skin which causes the soup to leak out. you're then left confused and distort, heart broken over the puddle of dumpling essence that was so helplessly wasted. i like this place because not only are their soup dumplings (and all other dishes) so stupidly delicious, but also because they were smart enough to use lettuce leaves to line the bottom so that the dumplings sit on a slick surface. you can thus successfully pick up your dumpling in confidence, without the worry of potential heartache, and transport them onto your plate with your little pouch of liquid happiness in tact. yay happy endings",1
Some time ago I was made to come in there. Now you`ll see me there now and then. I love that cuisine. And this place never disappoints. Delicious! Thank you,1
Get there early if you're going on a weekend. The wait is well worth it. I recommend getting everything family style that way you get a taste of everything. Soup dumplings are the signature dishes here at joe's,1
"The xiao long bao or soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai definitely live up to the hype! And I should know, I've been to Shanghai!

I would say these are even better than Din Tai Fung on the West Coast. The soup dumplings here are bigger than normal and there's sooo much soup inside of the dumplings. I've been to places where there is no soup in the dumplings and it's the biggest let down ever. 

There's usually a wait, but it moves rather quickly. We were seated within thirty minutes. We also ordered the Szechuan Beef noodle soup which was very flavorful and the pork chop noodle soup which actually comes with fried pork chops on the side and not in the soup. 

I will be dreaming about these soup dumplings!",1
"like their xiao long bau, steam bun, yum and juicy......
typical chinese restaurant service in china town. 
will come backfor the steam bun.",1
"One of my all-time favorite dim sum places in NYC. 

things to order: 
bean pastry
the scallion pancake
soup dumplings (of course!!!). 

trick for eating the soup dumplings: once you have placed the dumpling on your spoon, bite the top off and sip the soup out.  This will prevent any sort of mess. 

happy eating!",1
"get the soup dumplings. killer.

awesome service, great food. can't miss with this place. wait can be long, but worth it.",1
"My first review is pretty ancient and thought it required updating especially since they have a new location. The new location is very nice and is much more modern to their old location. 

First things first, don't forget this place is CASH ONLY. The service still isn't the greatest. The staff isn't very friendly and rarely do you see anyone smile there, but hey, we know why we all come here... THE SOUP DUMPLINGS. My favorite is the pork dumplings. If you really like crab, you'll enjoy the crab ones. They have a hint of a seafood taste, but I prefer sticking to the pork. 

We wanted honey chicken, but they don't have that so we got the sweet and sour chicken. Portion size was pretty small. It was not even close to being worth $21. It's more sour than sweet. We were told it came with rice, but we had to flag someone down to ask for rice and they brought this time little portion that is not a shareable portion. I wasn't a big fan; would have preferred another order of dumplings instead. 

A lot of first timers come here and I noticed they have no idea how to eat the dumplings. I educated the table next to me as I noticed they were trying to look over to see how it was done. 

I thought this little verbal tutorial might help: 
(Check out my photos to see the examples numbered for this description)

    1. Use the tongs to gently grab the dumpling at the very top. If you are too rough, it could pierce and cause you to lose your soup.
    3. Place dumpling on your mini soup spoon. 
    4. Bite a tiny hole near the top. 
    5. Use chopsticks to hold the dumpling up while you drink the soup then devour. 
::CHECK MARK:: If your plate looks like this in the end, great success!
::X MARK:: FAIL.

PS: Careful eating your first dumpling. They are extremely hot when they come to the table. Give it a min or two to cool down. Hope this was helpful. Enjoy!",1
"this place is very good for Chinese fan food. 

the food is very cheap. we ate a lot kinds of food but still pay cheap price.

recommended this place when you come to NY.

one thing I don't like: cash only, but cash only is popular in NY.",1
"What do you order at a Shanghai Restaurant?

Of course, SOUP DUMPLINGS!!  

You MUST order the CRAB and/or PORK MEAT SOUP DUMPLINGS when you go to Joe's Shanghai!!  Trust me, if you are here with a group of friends and family, you'd want to order more because 1 order only comes in 8.  Before you know it, 8 of them will disappear into everyone's tummy.  Anyhow, back to the soup dumplings.  The meat and soup are mixed incredibly well inside the thin layered dumpling.  To top it off, the dumplings taste even more scrumptious after dipping 'em in some ginger/vinager soy sauce.  I just love it!!",1
"Come eat their soup dumplings!! This was the best soup dumplings I've ever had. We stayed in Chinatown right next door to this restaurant so we had to try it. The dumpling soup was oozing out of my mouth while I ate it but that was the best part. Soupy and chewy, just how I like my soup dumplings. If you are in Chinatown, this is a must try!",1
"Community style dining with great dumplings.  Very strict wait staff.  We were told what to eat, lucky for us the food was tasty.",1
"as a self respecting shanghainese, i cannot give this place more than 4 stars. but boy am i glad that it's on this side of the ocean! yum. totally makes me miss shanghai. places like this are just a drop in the bucket there... sigh. there are rules for how locals eat xiao long bao and also secrets for how to prepare the juiciest hehe. okay i'm going to stop now bc i sound very elitest.",1
"""THIS IS A MUST TRY!!!"" FOR CHINATOWN It was difficult finding food that caught my eye, Gotta say the food from here was QUITE amazing FYI Me and my family had the fried rice, low mein, beef & broccoli, orange chicken & the dumplings everything was beyond fire. Recommend making reservations early the line can get crazy, since our hotel had a patio we ordered to go We went a little overboard but enjoyed the leftovers the next day",1
"This is my second time at Joe's Shanghai. I first visited the Flushing, Queens location about a year or so ago. Yesterday, I visited the China town location in Manhattan. When we arrived, the hostess informed us that there was a 30 minute wait (we were a party of 4) however, we were seated about 5 minutes later which was a major plus. 

We started with soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. BOTH ARE MUST HAVES (especially the soup dumplings which is what Joe's is known for). Since we were a party of four, we ordered multiple dishes which we all shared. LITERALLY EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! The General Tso's chicken was probably the best General Tso's I've ever had.

I guess the only downside was thaour waiter so badly did not want to be there. It was written all over his face. If he wasn't such a Debbie downer, I'd have given five stars. Otherwise, phenomenal food and fun atmosphere!",1
"Sat down very quickly, and waiter was attentive. I order the pork dumplings (8 for $6!) great choice. The egg roll was kind of pathetic to be honest. Friends got the soup dumplings and enjoyed.
Honestly, great food for a great deal. Would come back!",1
"Somehow ended up here late night with a few friends. Ordered a round of soup dumplings and some other delicious dishes. 

Memory is a bit hazy- did Whiskey Tavern come first? Or after? 

Just wanted to include a brief review, as this would make a good jury duty lunch break. The service is quick and it's walking distance from the courts. I wish I came here instead... still craving soup dumplings.",1
"dumplings!!!!
this location is better than the other located in queens...but i havent been to the midtown east location yet.",1
"Amazing. We had the crab and pork soup dumplings as well as the pork soup dumpling. Both were equally amazing, but I liked the crab best of the two. Must visit in Chinatown",1
"After hearing all the hype about Joe's Shanghai, I decided to give it a try when I was in the area during lunch. We got there at 11:30 and there was not a single table that wasn't occupied. Immediately I thought, the hype must be real and I was even more excited.

Ordered the pork soup dumplings and they were delicious. I really wanted to try the pork and crab soup dumplings but my friend doesn't eat crab so I settled for the pork. It was good and just the right amount of juice inside the dumpling. The fried pan noodles were also good- tasty, noodles were great, right amount of pork. One of the orders came out incorrectly and they had no problem switching it and correcting the mistake. 

I would definitely return but because it is so busy at night, I would opt for going during lunch.",1
Come early and expect lines. They only accept cash so go hit up a ATM first. Famous soup dumplings. They moved from their original location. More spacious and updated then the original spot. Happy the AC was pumping during this hot July day. Soup dumplings was on point. Make sure to let it cool before you punch a hole in the dough to release that savory hearty heavy soup broth. I wasn't careful and the soup squirted all over my shirt and pants. Battle scars but worth  walking  around stained shirt and pants.,1
"Tasty and then some, ordered scallion pancakes and pork dumplings, also a crab and pork dumpling. Sauces on point, fast service!!",1
This place is awesome. The pork dumplings are amazing. The water spinach definitely compliments it. We even sat next to Japanese people who coached us though ordering and properly eating the dumplings. One of the best eating experiences I have ever had. I will eat here again if I can.,1
Came back again for the nth time and tried the Lion's Heads for the first time.  The giant meatballs were so tender and tasty and rival the best Lion's Heads in China.  I was also impressed that the waiters didn't rush us even though there was a long line of people waiting to be seated and it was prime dinner time (Saturday at 6-7pm).,1
"Everytime I visit NY I make sure to stop by Joe's for some Xiao Long Baos.  They're basically pork soup dumplings.  I don't know how hard these are to make, but in the Bay Area I know of only one place that can make them close to how Joe's makes them....with just the right amount of soup and pork.  Most of the Xiao Long Bao dumplings here come with the either come with the skin too thick or not enough soup.  The dumplings are are affordable at around $7.  I've also tried the onion pancake as well as noodle dishes, but the main reason I visit are the dumplings.    

Basically you put one of those bad boys on a soup spoon, nibble a little of the top of the dumpling, and pour some of that vinegar sauce on top.  YUM!

Visit Joe's for the food.  Not for the service.  Most of the times you won't get a friendly smile, a waiter trying to make conversation, or smiley faces on your check.  The service is cut throat, no frills, here's your food, eat it and leave so we can seat the next party type of thing.  They're  trying to get you in and out.  If you go at peak times during lunch and dinner, expect a line.  The wait to get seated can be very long.",1
Hands down one of the best places to eat in all of NYC.  The food was amazing. The service was great! The atmosphere was authentic and inviting.  Definitely try the dumpling appetizer!,1
"I was in Chinatown and decided to try this much talked about place. The inside and outside are just like any other typical Chinatown place. The prices here are comparable as well.

We had an order of fried dumplings and also the soup dumplings as well. They were both very good and very succulent. I actually liked the fried ones more (despite the soup ones being the specialty here), simply because I am a bigger fan of fried.

Also, I tried some of their Fried Rice, which was well done but with the same quality you would find in any Chinatown place. The other entree I tried was their Fried Rice Cakes with Beef. Their version here was excellent. The Fried Rice Cakes dish is very similar in taste to Beef Chow Fun except the noodles are shaped like discs and are chewier. I like the way this restaurant prepared the beef in it as well - very soft and moist.",1
"I've been here so many times and would take friends here all the time. The wait times aren't as bad when you go during off-times. However, this place has gotten so much busier than before. We waited 45 min at 3pm for 3 people. Go in small groups to get seated faster. They now also add the gratuity to the bill that they didn't do before. Still pretty cheap for some good soup dumplings. Other stuff on the menu are really good as well! I would recommend scallion pancakes and turnip cakes if you want to try something different!",1
"Very clean environment and the food was very good.  The service was quick (perhaps because it isn't during hottest time of the day) and the food came out a lot quicker than expected.  The pot has a lot of things in it including crab, fish, mussels, etc.  I personally liked the Ma Po Tofu.  Highly recommend!",1
"Brace yourself for the musty air, seafood stench, and Shanghainese flavors, all faintly yet pleasantly grazing your olfactory receptors. That, my friends, is a recipe for a legit Chinatown experience. By luck, our party of 3 was seated right away in a full house on a Tuesday at 7:30pm. We got 3 orders of XLB, an order of scallion pancakes, and the shrimp fried rice cakes. Soup dumplings have just the right consistency--skin breaks with the slightest puncture so handle them with some TLC before chomping down. I recommend ordering each round individually to maximize the freshness of the dumplings. The scallion pancakes were a bit drier than expected, but nothing too unpleasant. With the best for last, the shrimp fried rice cakes are a must-try. Generous portion size with a plethora of rice cakes, right amount of shrimp & mushrooms, and minimal veggies. All for ~$50 with tip. As anticipated, service moved quick. Expect to sit elbow-to-elbow with other parties in the same table, which I think adds to the experience. This place is no joke.",1
"The food here is SO good! I love soup dumplings and really enjoyed the pork ones at Joe's. I also thought their wonton soup was perfect. Overall, if you're looking for staple Chinese dishes (such as noodle soups, dumplings, fried rice, and protein-centric plates) you're going to enjoy this place.

Disclaimer: It is cash only. Plus, their seating system is hectic AF. When my group arrived they were swamped and gave us a ticket with a number on it. They called our ticket and gave us less than a minute to make our way through the chaos to the stand before giving up our spot. Then, the host was a little rude about the situation...but we enjoyed our food once we made it in. Worth it though.",1
"Craving soup dumplings?  Save yourself the 16 hours flight to Shanghai and see Joe's in Chinatown.  They will hook you up with 8 of the most delicious crab/pork dumplings for only $8.75.  The pork dumpling are amazing too for $6.75 for 8 pieces.  Everything else on their menu ranges from ok to meh.  For dinner sometimes there is a crowd, but midweek is ok.  They also do pick-up orders.",1
"How anyone can review JS with lower than 5 stars is beyond me. 

Here's a tip: do NOT got here for anything but the Soup Dumplings. They are like pure heaven erupting into your mouth- pork or crab! I was introduced to this place 6 years ago when I got back from traveling abroad from SE Asia and I was super impressed. The ambiance is also super fun if you are looking for a truly family-style place that takes you out of the cold in NYC. You will sit at a full table of strangers, so if you are on a first date and do not want to be to intimate yet, this is the place for you. Seating goes quickly as does ordering and food delivery.

I love Joes!",1
"Din Tai Fung has NOTHING on this place.  Yes, I've been to Din Tai Fung MULTIPLE times.  Yes, I know what it taste like.  NO!  It is not better than Joe's Shanghai.

First and foremost, these Xiao long bao's are THE MOST SOUPY/JUCIEST one's I've EVER had.  I tried the crab and pork based on the numerous recommendations here on yelp.  Well guess what, 400 people aren't wrong.  They are both amazing.  I'll save you from reading what everyone else has typed and just say, ""go out and try it""

Aside from the xiao long bao I had the hot and sour soup, kung pao chicken and the shanghai noodles.  All were very good, especially the noodles.  While they weren't as amazing as the xiao long bao, they were good enough to add to them.  It just helps me affirm this 5 star rating.

Pros:
 - AMAZING xiao long bao
 - solid chinese food

Cons:
 - the wait (I waited around 45 minutes for dinner on a Sunday night)
 - seating (you share seating around a table of 8)",1
A little over priced but food was great! Lots of seating and a wide selection. Great place to get soup dumplings but also all the local New Yorkers go to flushing for the best soup dumplings. Portion sizes are pretty good and we had no wait on a Wednesday evening with a part of 3,1
Good soup dumplings. There is long lines. You need to go either before 11am or after 2 pm if you don't want to wait.,1
Best dumplings ever! The shrimp fried rice was super good too! Will definitely be back here soon! Yum!,1
"Amazing, addictive, legendary soup dumplings? Check. Tasty beef with bean curd? Check. Loud, crazy atmosphere with typical Chinatown service? Check.  Worth the 45 minute wait and every penny? Most definitely.  I cannot wait to go back!",1
Of course there's going to be a wait. So be prepared! We were super excited to try the dumplings here since we LOVE XLB (Shanghai dumplings) so that was the only thing we had. We ordered both the pork and the crab. The pork had more flavor and also soup more than the crab. So I recommend on ordering just the pork dumplings!,1
"For this place, you just gotta forget about the decor, the service, and the ambiance. Why? Because it's a Chinese place right in Chinatown that serves some pretty seriously delicious soup dumplings. And Chinese service is most of the time, pretty bad. Have you been to a dimsum place before? It's just the culture. There's so many people in there and waiting outside for their food they gotta turn them table quick. 

Been here many times throughout the years and this place never let me down on the taste of the food. Soup dumplings always come out piping hot. My favorite is the crab pork soup dumplings. I also get a fried rice dish that I can't remember the name of in English but it has all the meats in there plus shrimp and egg. The scallion pancakes are pretty good too.

All in all its an awesome place to go for some good soup dumplings and don't be surprised if there is a long wait time.",1
"Their soup dumplins are the best, I we also had the friend rice and General Tso's chicken. Best Chinese I've ever had in the USA. Worth the short wait, takes only cash.",1
"Joes Shanghai was delicious. We had the meat soup dumplings, braised 1/2 duck, and scallion pancake.  The soup dumplings were perfect on a cold January day, the scallion pancakes were authentic, and the duck was easily the best ever I've had. The meat was incredibly soft and came right off the bone. The texture was very similar to pork ribs, and the sauce was just right!",1
"Joe's Shanghai is more about getting a hold of those tasty little soup dumplings packed with huge flavor whenever you can for me. So here is the deal. 

I read some of the reviews on here and some of the obvious statements that some people make are hilariously contradictory within the same paragraph. Ok, moving on ;)

Sure there are probably better ""Soup Dumplings"" or what they refer to as Xiao Long Bao (XLB's), in the world. I would hope so, especially in China.... no?

Point is there is NOWHERE better in NYC for the price, the taste, and plainly the SOUP DUMPLINGS Period!  (*purposely equally contradictory statement*)

The soup dumplings are BOMB. If you come here after 6:15pm Mon-Wed then you are going to wait. DO NOT sit around looking like you don't belong anywhere in all of Chinatown when you arrive. Walk straight in and look for the asian girl with the clipboard and ticket numbers, let her know how many people in your party, and take a number. Thursday - Sunday you would have to get there by 5:30pm to not have any real wait. After that, good luck. 

We normally order the pork/crab dumplings. They are the ones we like best, some bok choy, a bit of shrimp fried rice and a couple of traditional ""New York"" chinese dishes like Kung Pao or Chicken Broccoli. Irrelevant since we really just come for the dumplings, beer and bok choy. 

Joe's Shanghai is an absolute MUST especially if you have never had a soup dumpling in your life before and whether or not you are from NYC or not. If you are NOT from NYC, are visiting in town, and not sure of when you will ever be back, then for you it is DEFINITELY, 100%, POSITIVELY A MUST! and, you will be hooked. 

Make sure while you're waiting outside you read up on their window of articles, how to eat the soup dumplings properly so that you don't burn your mouth on the first bite and actually get to enjoy the thing. For those of you that may get a little nervous from the pressure of this, it's ok - You can also order a small soup bowl, which my brother does, and just dump the dumpling in it and enjoy in all its glory! 

Remember that the place is CASH only. The cheapest ATM, in case you do forget your cash, is the .99 cent ATM inside the McDonalds on Bowery between Pell and Bayard. It's a half a block away so basically, if you are standing at the door of Joe's Shanghai facing outside you make a right as soon as you get out of the restaurant and walk to that corner. You can cross the street and walk to the corner since you will have to cross it later anyway. That corner will be ""Bowery"" at which point you then make a left on Bowery and walk a few paces until you see the golden arches on your left side, where the storefronts will be, as you walk towards ""Bayard"". McDonald's is literally on that block. 

Also remember that it is communal sitting so you're not thrown off if you happen to be seated with other people. If you are a group of 2 or 4 you can request some of the private tables for your party, which just means you may have to wait  a little longer. Big Groups are great here but you do wait longer as well, and everyone in your party must be there to be seated or they will skip you until your party arrives, so keep that in mind.

Regardless of the wait and cash only thing, the soup dumplings are a must try and nothing really ever beats the experience and atmosphere of being in Chinatown for me anyway, which Joe's Shanghai helps to complete somehow. 

5 stars for the dumplings alone. They are worth the wait.",1
"As a new comer to Chinese food, I give this place a top review. Insanely great soup dumplings, I could eat the whole bowl to myself. I also had the fried dumplings, just as incredible. It's community seating for the most part, so come ready to sit with strangers (probably not a great place for 1st and 2nd dates). Also, be ready to wait outside for at least 15 minutes if coming for dinner. There hasn't been a night of the week I haven't had to wait. It's a top place for soup dumplings! P.S. - bring cash.",1
"The place is always crowded but its worth the wait. Service is prompt and attentive meaning you get your food fast. While the menu is vast the best item  is the soup Dumplings. The Dumplings are very delicate due to being filled with a rich broth to drink before consuming the rest with complementary black vinegar and chili oil. The next best item in my opinion is the fried rice. Whether it's the chicken,  beef, pork, or Shanghai style each version has its own unique flavor that when mixed together creates a new depth. All in all a great place to go with a few people and try several dishes. Just make sure to get enough soup Dumplings for everyone.",1
"Great place for soup dumplings!! Other dishes are just okay.

If you visit during the week, the wait is tolerable (~15 minutes) during regular meal times (lunch or dinner) and almost immediate towards the beginning or tail end of their operating hours.

If you visit in the weekend, expect a hefty wait unless there's a huge weather event (snowing, rain, etc.)

The key is to march in there confidently and find the lady with the clip board. Give her your name and number of people in your party, and she will tell you how long, and most of the time give you a number. If not, she will tell you to stand aside and table will be coming right up.

The soup dumplings are quite big (compared to Din Tai Fung), soupy, flavorful, and very satisfying. Tip: Order one to start and then as soon as the first one comes, tell the server you want another. Many times, people order two soup dumplings at once and by the time they're done with the first one, the second one on the bottom is already cooled.

I actually think this place may be better than Din Tai Fung as the soup dumplings are more filling, cheaper, and doesn't have MSG (at least I don't go home thirsty after eating here).

This is a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Do not expect good service. Fight to eat. Eat to fight. Don't be offended if the servers are dismissive, impatient, yelling at each other, or in a bad mood. Imagine yourself working there a week and perhaps you'll behave the same way.

Flag down any of the servers for anything you need. If they're not the right person, they'll talk to the right person for your table/section.

Also, service charge is already included in the bill. Cash only as many others have stated but there's an ATM right outside the inner door now.",1
"It was everything we hoped for and more. We were craving soup dumplings, and soup dumplings we had. Cheap, tasty, and relatively healthy.",1
"Maybe this is an opinion influenced by extreme hunger (we had just trekked across the Brooklyn Bridge before coming to Joe's), but these are the best soup dumplings I've ever had. I got scared when I saw that the line was out the door, but the hostess was super efficient and quick with seating - shared tables help with this. So so good!",1
Went there with a friend to try their soup dumplings. Got the regular pork soup dumplings and it was good but not to the point where I am surprised. There were a lot of people and it was very crowded. shared a big table with three other sets of people and were squashed. but despite all the people they didnt get our orders wrong. only thing i disliked was that it was hard to call someone if you needed something.,1
"5 stars for the food was so good, I got the pork dumpling and orange chicken. They are family style plates but are on the smaller side but still delicious!
2 stars for the staff, they  left a little bit to be desired, the food was sort of just dropped off in front of you and I felt tense. Not sure if it was because of I had a service dog but they asked a couple times if we were done yet with food still on our plate. Know it's a busy place so not reading too much into it but the food was delicious.",1
"I did one order of the pork soup dumpling at Joe's Shanghai -- the soup was a great temperature, minimal tongue scalding and very flavorful. The black vinegar had a vaguely medicinal taste, but otherwise was good. Dumplings has strong structural integrity and we're sticky when I chewed them. Only negative with the dumplings was that they didn't have the ginger seals that some others do. Would happily take friends/family there are on future occasions.",1
"Solid 4 stars. 

Since my most extensive experience with xiao long bao has been with Din Tai Fung (been to the locations in Costa Mesa, Arcadia, Seattle, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), this review will focus largely on comparing the two locations.

Where Joe's Shanghai wins:
- Soup:dumpling ratio: There have been times when I bite into DTF's xiao long bao's and the amount of soup was disappointingly small. The XLB at Joe's were so juicy that I had trouble eating it (a good problem to have). 
- Pricing: prices here are substantially cheaper than DTF's, which means more bang for your buck. 

Where Din Tai Fung wins:
- Flavor of the soup: the soup in the XLB at DTF has a noticeably more complex flavor profile. 
- Service: more polite, but I think that comes with the fact that DTF has a more upscale ambiance. Minor win. 
- Other food items: at both DTF and Joe's, I've ordered some of their non-XLB dishes. The food at Joe's overall was just okay - not bad, but not stellar. Their scallion pancakes were good, but it was really fried and rather oily. Their vegetable dish was mediocre, and was actually the most expensive thing we ordered. The noodle soup was rather bland - would definitely skip. DTF's other menu items are overshadowed by their XLB, but it's better than the one's I tried at Joe's. 

Differences:
- Atmosphere: many of the DTF locations are on the nicer end, with a clean, upscale atmosphere. Joe's Shanghai on the other hand is more similar to your typical Asian restaurants - loud and casual. Not a pro or a con in my book for either case. 

Overall, I wish that DTF and Joe's Shanghai's would fuse together - bigger, juicier XLB at a cheaper price, with DTF's soup base. But very solid 4 stars - would definitely go back if I'm in the area.",1
"After indulging in Philly cheese steaks for lunch, the bf and I wanted something light to eat for dinner. Since we took an earlier Bolt bus back into NYC, we decided to head to Joe's since we were supposed to check it out last night.

I've heard so much about this place from friends who have visited and since I love xlbs, I had to get an order...or two. Thankfully we arrived at the right time which meant not having to wait for a table. We entered the very tightly packed restaurant and told one of the girls (who are wearing by the way, florescent yellow/green sweatshirts) we wanted a table for 2 people. Since the place is so tight and busy, they seat you homestyle, meaning you're sharing the table with another party.

Once we sat we got our hot tea and ordered one order of the pork (which I heard is the best and costs ~$5 for 8 pieces) and one order of the pork and crab combo (~$7 for 8 pieces). It took about 10 minutes for the xlbs but when they arrived, I forgot about how long it took and jumped in.

On first glance, the xlbs look larger than the standard sizes I've seen in Richmond, Canada and in Burlingame. But when you try to lift one off the bed of cabbage, make sure you grab from the top or you'll break the dough and all the sweet, tasty meat sauce will be gone.

I felt there was more xlb sauce than meat which I was a bit disappointed in. The skin was thin and chewy and the pork meat tender. You get a side dish of vinegar with pieces of ginger. I like ginger with my xlbs so that added accompaniment was appreciated. The pork and crab combo....yeah, don't even get an order. It's not worth the price or the taste buds. Luckily my bf is a human vacuum with an indiscriminate palate so he got to finish the pork and crab combo while I enjoyed my pork dumplings.

If you like xlbs or want to try them, I'd definitely recommend this place. Just be prepared to wait in line and make sure you have cash on hand since they don't accept plastic.",1
We came for one thing and one thing only. Soup dumplings! Boy did they not disappoint. The broth was fantastic and the pork full of flavor.,1
"I've been to the one in Flushing and quality and look of restaurant is the same. We arrived around 9:30 on. Monday night so it wasn't very busy but still a good amount of people - they sat us right away. We got the pork soup dumplings, chicken fried rice, and Shanghai noodle soup. Everything was fresh, came out very fast and was delicious. Can't wait to come back and try some other dishes!",1
"There was a time when I would come here with my friends in earnest. We'd wait outside for an eternity as the hostess kept promising everyone that their table would be ready soon. After an hour, sometimes two, we'd go in and see who could eat the most dumplings. I usually got to two baskets before keeling over and dieing. The soup dumplings are still good, but no longer the best in the city. They're definitely not worth the long waits. The rest of the menu is surprisingly good as well. I love scallion pancakes and they do a great one. All of the usual Americanized stuff is there and executed much better than expected. And it's still pretty cheap.",1
"Best soup dumplings I've ever had.

Yes, it's crowded, but it's an institution!",1
"This place has the best dumplings I've ever had! My family has gone here before, but we wanted to find it again because of one thing we loved the first time we went, the soup dumpling. We had gone to chinatown in Italy not long ago to get some soup dumplings, unfortunately they disappointed us. We got to this restaurant and were instantly seated at a table, we ordered some pork soup dumpling, scallion pancakes, spring rolls, and fried dumplings. The food came out in a couple minutes and we tried one of everything, and it did not disappoint. All of the food was delicious. The soup dumpling broth was rich in flavor and the scallion pancakes were very crispy. The only thing that was not entirely perfect was the spring rolls, instead of spring rolls they gave us egg rolls, it was not a big deal though because they were still delicious!
The look of the restaurant is beautiful and very clean!
I will definitely be telling my friends to come here!",1
"Soup Dumplings were great but regular menu items are hit or miss. If you do order something other than dumplings, the fish belly is really good.",1
"I recommend the food at Joe's Shanghai for lunch.  It is not overcrowded, however, you may need to share the table with other guests (pretty normal in chinese restaurants).  At times, I pass by the restaurant during dinner time and the long waiting lines form outside the restaurant.  

It has the authentic taste from Shanghai and I usually order:
- Crab Meat with Pork Meat Steamed Bun (8 per order) 
- 3 cold dishes platter with Braised Sliced Beef, jelly fish, Wine Chicken
- Lion's Head (Stewed Pork Balls)
- Lima Bean Salad and Pork with Bean Curd Tripe (for healthy eaters)

The quality of the food is consistent everytime I visit the restaurant.  
There is a 15% tip included in the check, which is very reasonable.",1
"(12.12.15) Yum, yum! Had the pork soup dumplings and the crab & pork soup dumplings. The ginger in the soy sauce was great. Line is incredibly long and they pack you in like sardines, but it's worth it for the experience. They even have pics of Jeremy Lin's visit there on their walls!",1
"Very simple, go for the dumplings.  Everything else is good, but your standard Chinese restaurant offering, the dumplings, excellent!",1
"I had been hearing for months from my friend how awesome they were.  They're frigging dumplings, how good can they be?  Up until now, my experience with dumplings have been at cheap chinese restaurants around Los Angeles and Orange County.  Probably not the greatest frame of reference, but if there are people in front of Joe's waiting with Cold War-like paranoia making sure the girl didn't pass up their number it can't be all bad.

The dumplings were amazing.  The soup inside was so tasty and with each dumpling I ate, I was simultaneously happy that I was eating them and sad that there was one less dumpling for me to enjoy.  My girlfriend, her friend and I split one order of the pork dumplings, one order of the crab dumplings, the water spinach, and the noodles (I forget what kind, but they were damn good too).  

I guess the only sticking point could be that you may sit at a table with strangers because it's so crowded.  It gets kind of awkward when they get your food before you and they get to eat while you're frigging starving.",1
"#9, #10. That's all you need to say. They call soup dumplings ""buns"", so if you actually try to order by the menu you could get confused. To be honest I could not tell the difference between the shrimp or pork dumplings, but the ones I think were the shrimp ones tasted better. Also go with scallion pancake and shanghai noodles.

The difference in wait between 2 ppl and 3 is significant, since if you're group of 3 they'll wait for an 8 person table to open up so that they can sit you with another group of 3 and a group of 2.

Stuffed my face and in the end was less than 20 bucks a person.",1
Luckily no wait! Came on a Friday night and got seated immediately. Ordered the scallion pancake and XLB. The pancake was a bit thick and not a lot of green onions... It was a good crisp but other than that probably wouldn't order again. So at least 4 of the XLB skins broke upon contact which is a downgrade BUT if you are able to get an intact XLB in one bite then man is it good. The soup is flavorful and there's plenty of meat with not too much skin. If you're in the area and there's not a long wait I'd give it a try.,1
I've been here twice now and love their Xiao long bao both the crab and pork ones. Scallion pan cake is another favorite dish of mine. Avoid weekends or holidays if you don't want to stand in line for hours to get a table. You most of the time will be seated with other strangers so get comfortable.,1
"We were able to sit outside due to COVID and I'm so glad we did. The weather was great. Besides that, the food was absolutely delicious. We had soup dumplings, hot and sour soup, and Kung Pao chicken. Food was flavorful and made quickly. Service was awesome. Will definitely recommend!",1
"Great food, exact same owner and menu as down the block except less crowded. Food is usually good but I have to give them 4 stars because the staff isn't attentive enough.",1
"Delicious dragon buns!!!  This place makes the best soup dumplings for sure.  

Every dish there is good, but, do not skip the dragon buns/soup dumplings, since that's what they are famous for.",1
"Damn good soup dumplings, but you're on Yelp so you already knew that.  Everything else is pretty typical - pickled veg, beef pan fried noodles, decent service.  Only other thing worth noting is it's cash only.",1
"Dumpling heaven! I mean really, the holy grail! 

Came in on a Saturday night, so it was predictably crowded, but the wait wasn't long. It was also systematic, with numbered chits and what not! Got seated at a large round table with 2 other couples, but didn't mind since this wasn't expected to be fine dining in any case.

Too bad that they only accept cash though, and since we'd been to 3 pubs earlier the same evening where we felt inclined to tip well, both of us were running (scraping-the-bottom-of-the-barrel) low. Soo, all we tried was the pork soup dumpling! But the tip from a friend paid off, and these were awesome! The spicy sauce went beautifully with the piping hot, delicately flavored little bags of soupy, meaty, goodness, and they were gone in 60 seconds! Man, if only I had more cash on me! 

Servers were efficient and polite as well, and we'll probably be back to try some more stuff on the menu. So glad we stopped by!",1
"The point of eating authentic Shanghai dumplings is BECAUSE of the juicy wet meat juice inside of the Dumpling. If you don't like their dumpling because it easily breaks PLEASE TRY your local chinese take out that trick ""foreigners""

IF YOU PREFER to eat dry dumplings then please head to a Allen St Dumpling or if you prefer bootleg thick coated dumplings please head to your Great Wall take out.

HOW TO EAT SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS 1)enjoy the sweet aroma when it is served 2)carefully use the tong and pick up the dumplings one by one to prevent it from sticking 3) when you want to eat one, carefully use the tong and pick it up NOT from the bottom but from the hardest spot - the top 4)quickly use your soup spoon and place the dumpling on it. 5)add some vinegar/soy sauce on it if you like 6)bite the top(the hardest part)and slowly suck the juice out 7)finish it 

*Please don't eat the cabbage underneath the dumplings.....

*Customer service suckkkks here. They always seem on a rush to kick you out.(then again, there is usually a huge line) Worse, they just seem really agitated. I've not met one close to friendly server here - so don't expect much. 

*Crowded. Expect to sit next to old grannies to drunken drunks.(alcohol friendly) Hey, you get to meet new people.(The truth is almost 99% of the time the people you sit with are A-ok)

THE BEST DARN SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS IN NYC. Oh yea, I also visit san francisco alot and many sf'ers say SF does not have a dumpling place like this.",1
"This was my 2nd visit to Joe's, specifically for steamed dumplings and they didn't disappoint. So simple, flavorful and delicious.

My own complaint was that we were sitting right by the door and it was getting chilly, so we got cold every time the door was opened.

Can't wait for my next visit...",1
"Good service, very good food. The restaurant itself is an easy laid back traditional Asian restaurant",1
"Even if you don't order their famous dumplings (which all contain pork), this is still a great place, and a great value.",1
"I've found that the more hole in the wall a dim sum place is, the more I'm gonna like it! This spot is no exception. 
It was packed- but they managed to seat my party of two immediately (the turnover speed is INSANE!). 
The food is so inexpensive, we decided to get at least 5 dishes. Everything came fast and at a great pace, so we didn't feel rushed or hungry! 
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the crispy noodles were very chewy- not crispy.",1
"I always come here for two things: pork/crab dumplings and beef rice cakes! When I'm in town, I often take solo visits here and just enjoy the food. This is their newer location so it's nice and spacious. Waiting times are often not too long and if anything, there's a bunch of boba shops and bakeries nearby you can check out while you wait. The service is fast. They take safety precautions with temperature checks. Would recommend to anyone who comes to Chinatown, you won't regret it.",1
"Best soup dumpling ever, get the crab meat one. It was an hour wait for us , but it's totally worth it",1
"CASH ONLY

Pork soup dumplings

"My favorite restaurant of all time.
There's always a wait to get into the place, but it's totally worth it!
The soup dumplings? THE BEST. They're famous for good reason. And the dumplings aren't the only worthwhile thing on the menu! Try the Shanghai noodles. When I die, heaven had better be FULL of them, because they are the tastiest noodles I've ever eaten!

I'd recommend Joe's to anyone. Yes, it's crowded and noisy, and since it's family style you may be sharing a table with a stranger, but it's all part of the experience. Everyone should go here at least once for amazing, authentic food!",1
A must-go every time I am in nyc. I love the soup dumplings and the taiwanese noodle stir fry. Everything is very reasonably priced and delicious. It is true that the service could be better and you will get seated with random strangers but its somewhat expected of Chinese restaurants. Overall enjoy coming here and to me is the ultimate comfort food..!,1
"Love this place. I tell everyone to go here. The soup dumplings, orange beef and fried rice are my recommends. It's also a good place to try something new! It can be a wait but totally worth it and you get SO MUCH FOOD. It can also great really loud but that's part of it. Feels like Chinatown but it's not weird. Check out their website, too--they've made a funny video about how to eat the soup dumplings. Ha.",1
"honestly, this is some of the best chinese i've ever had. the orange chicken is perfect. i  joe's shanghai!",1
"Excellent! I ended up finding this place on yelp myself and after reading reviews, we decided to give it a shot. We were not disappointed. There was never an empty seat! At first the seating arrangements were odd to us but at the end we really enjoyed the company and the food was just delicious!",1
"Probably one of the best place for ""xiao long bao"" (pork one! i dont like the crabmeat) in the USA. I forgot the other restaurant in NYC that is also very good...It's not really compareble to Asia because a lot of them broke because their were stuck to the plate thing and the soup spilled out which kind of defeated the purpose of the whole dumpling...

Their shanghai fried rice---OMG ORDER IT!!!! I just ordered it on a whim because it had ""shanghai"" in its name and when it came, you don't know how disappointed I was just looking at it. I was thinking to myself ""oh god, it look so plain...it must taste awful."" NOPE. Took a bite and my eyes lit up. I said ""Wow, this is the best fried rice i've ever tasted."" Or one of the best. And everyone agreed. Also got the pork noodle-- that was okay. The scallion pancakes were nice..but so greasy. My friend got the ""artificial duck"" because she's a vegetarian..I tried to stop her..but she wouldn't listen. And in the end she said it tasted like rubber and mushrooms. Ew.

Oh, there's a long wait. We waited..maybe 30 minutes...or more...around 8pm on a Sunday. I guess if you eat a lil later you don't really have to wait...",1
"dont order anything but the Shanghai dumplings, with crab or shrimp or pork, they are all very good. Service & ambience sucks though, so you have to close an eye and just enjoy those freaking dumplings!!",1
"We were visiting New York and definitely wanted to stop by and see what soup dumplings were all about! Our wait was about 45 mins long and we were seated with two other groups so it was very interesting to say the least. I guess they were trying to seat everyone as soon as possible.  We ordered to orders of the pork Xiao long baos, spring rolls and shanghai fried noodles.

The spring rolls came out first and they were nice and hot. The fillings was your standard but they were a lot larger than we expected.

The noodles came out a little after and they were good but a little too greasy for my liking.

The pork xiao long baos finally came out and they were steaming hot in all their deliciousness. The dumplings came out piping hot and were overflowing with delicious broth that was full of depth and flavor. The sauce was a nice compliment to the savoriness of the dumplings.

Overall, this was our first experience at soup dumplings and we found them delicious. Other than the wait, we would definitely consider coming back again!",1
"Must visit!!!

Joe's Shanghai was on my to-visit list and it did not disappoint, at all :) My boyfriend and I visited around 4:45PM on a Saturday and was seated after waiting for around 5 minutes. I think we were lucky because I've heard how crazy the wait can be on Yelp.

We got 2 orders of the soup dumpling bc duh and wonton soup, scallion pancake, fried rice.

Pork soup dumpling (10/10) STAR OF THE SHOW i'm not kidding when i say it's the best xlb i've ever had! It's huge and at a great price. The skin is thin and has the perfect chew but no so thin that it breaks inside the steamer. Sooo much soup inside and the filling is seasoned well. I could taste the gelatin from pork bones and it was right up my alley :D

Everything else was also good but nothing that blew my mind :) Service was also okay. We paid $65 after t&t for 2 people and had leftovers to bring home. 

Food 4/5
XLB 5/5
Service 3/5
Experience 4.8/5",1
"This place is all it's talked up to be. You must get the soup dumplings and eat them first. They are best fresh and not worth taking for later. The green beans were delicious and the pan fried noodles were very good. The place is small and you have to share a table with other people, but the great thing about that is that the people you share the table with sometimes leave you their leftovers!",1
"My friends and I went here to try out Joe's Shanghai.  We had to try out the soup dumplings and we just ordered a side of fried rice.  I've had Dinh Tai Fung's soup dumplings in Arcadia, Ca and I must say, Joe's Shanghai is pretty descent.  Nothing beats Dinh Tai Fung (since they have a VARIETY of soup dumplings), but Joe's is pretty close.  Unfortunately they only have Pork Dumplings so vegetarians or pescatarians be informed.  For the price, its reasonable.  8 dumplings for 4.25 ~ 0.50 cents each.  Try it out, I am sure you will like it!

Couple of things to know on how to eat the soup dumpling.

1.  Place soup dumpling on spoon.
2.  Use chopsticks and puncture one whole allowing soup to seep out a little.
3.  Place sauce on top.  (IF you want the sauce to be a bit spicier, mix the chili in, helps enhance your taste buds!)
4.  Devour in one bite to enjoy party in mouth!",1
Our server Ken was very friendly and excellent.  Steamed buns Were worth the wait!,1
"Love the crab and pork soup dumplings! There are places with better value soup dumplings, but I still like to frequent this place.",1
"Come for their Xiao Long Bao!! We were quickly seated, but since it was busy they seated us in a large table that had two empty seats. Everyone was friendly and enjoyed their own meal/conversations so it wasn't a big deal. If you wanted your own table, you could specify but it'd probably be a much longer wait. 

The XLB was one of the best I've ever had! There's so much soup that it nearly filled my whole spoon. They're also cheap and come out quickly! I ordered two (8 pieces each) and it made us both extremely full. I'd high recommend trying their pork XLB - it's worth the hype!",1
"This is my first review of Joe's Shanghai's but I have been several times now. I have been to the one in Manhattan and the one in Chinatown most recently which this review is based on. The one in Chinatown was a little hard to find at first because it recently moved to a different location and my uber ride took me to the older location. Luckily, it was still walking distance to the new location so it wasn't a big deal but just something to keep in mind. The new location is 46 Bowery St which is a bigger and much nicer space than before. 
Every time I go to Joe's I always order the same thing which is the soup dumplings with pork and the scallion pancakes. Both are very delicious (especially the soup dumplings) and are something I crave every time I am in NYC! The soup dumplings are not available where I live (SC) and so this makes them even more enticing every time I come to NYC.  I would say they are the best soup dumplings in the city but that would not be fair because I have heard there are many other places in NYC that have great soup dumplings as well but I never want to take the chance of being disappointed since I usually have very limited time when I am in the city. Having said that, you cannot go wrong here by coming here for the soup dumplings and this is always a must do spot in the city if that is what you are craving. The only caveat with going here or to any of the locations is that you are looking at a 45-60 minute wait which is annoying but I feel like it is still worth the wait. I am giving Joe's 4 stars only because I have ONLY eaten the scallion pancakes and soup dumplings and they have a pretty extensive menu available. I do not feel like it is fair to judge an entire restaurant based on 2 items off the menu even though they are so delicious. I will say though that I have seen other food items come out of the kitchen and they all looked really good.

Pro Tip: If you go to the new location in Chinatown then go next door to the hotel called Hotel 50 Bowery NYC. They have a great bar and rooftop that is a perfect place to get a drink and enjoy a nice view while you wait. It's a little pricey but worth it.",1
"Two words, soup dumplings (or three words, xiao long bao).

It is a very touristy location, but that doesn't mean it's not good. The inside is crowded, and a little dirty, but hey, it's Chinatown. My group was sat at a table with strangers. The waitstaff was quick and efficient.

The soup dumplings were great. The prices are very reasonable ($4-6, depending on the type). The original pork has a better flavor than the crab and pork, and is cheaper! The soup dumplings are large and tasty. However, the skins are VERY thick. Normally you have to be delicate when getting them, but with these there's little risk of tearing.

This is in NO WAY on par with ding tai fung. But it's still damn good.

Worth going to, but I need to try Shanghai Cafe for comparison. Try going early or late to avoid the tourists and the inevitable wait.",1
"This place is a tourist trap - NOT. This is one of the ""touristy"" locations that I absolutely love. I'm a big fan of the crab soup dumplings, good pricing and old school Chinatown feel. Chinatown is getting way too gentrified, Joe's Shanghai keeps it real and maintains that culture",1
"I have a massive blister on the roof of my mouth courtesy of the piping hot crab and pork xiao long bao here and I would not hesitate to take another massive blister if it meant that I would get another order of these babies.  

They were absolutely delicious and despite the pain they might inflict, are well worth it.  The broth is super rich and even slightly fatty, but that is all part of the goodness.  The skin of the dough is maybe slightly on the thicker side, but it had a good chewiness to it that gave and resisted just enough, not unlike a good woman.  My only knock against it was that two of my eight XLB had leaked so they were devoid of much broth when they arrived.  That was the only downside to what was otherwise a tremendous soup dumpling.  

The green onion pancake was also surprisingly good.  I generally prefer the flakier kind to the doughier ones, but this one was like a little hybrid, with a crispy crunchy slightly flaky outer crust and a denser, chewy center.  It was very pleasant.  I thought the green onion flavor might've been a little light though.  It probably could have benefited from a bit more green onions, but I may just be nitpicking here.  

I came at an odd hour; well past the lunch crowd and long before the dinner crowd set in, so I was seated immediately.  The XLB order was pretty much placed right away and arrived fairly quickly.  The rest of the food arrived similarly quickly.  The service was efficient and typically Chinese, which is to say, not super friendly, but not rude.  The prices were pretty reasonable for what you get and I'd definitely come back for more XLB.",1
"Literally the best Chinese food I've ever had. Out of all the resturants in the nearby vicinity this was the only place with a line & a wait outside. Wait time was about 20 minutes but we'll worth it. Ordered the pork dumplings and they were incredible.. a mix between a soup and a dumpling!  Great for groups, just plan to wait to be seated.",1
"Returned to Joe's after an 8-month hiatus and my love for this restaurant remains unwavering. Our wait for 9 people wasn't too bad for a Sunday evening (approximately 30 minutes). We had a really funny waiter who helped us pick entrees (as I'm always at somewhat at a loss for what to order other than the soup dumplings and green beans Szechaun-style, especially when I'm put on the spot to order for the table by my darling father). The pork soup dumplings were delicious as always. Other dishes we had that were really good - scallion pancakes, sliced beef with jalapeno, pork fried rice, prawns in chili sauce (though it's not really a chili sauce and more of a sweet sauce), kung pao chicken, and water spinach. Not a fan of the curry noodles so I wouldn't recommend that. Oh and good to know: it's cash only.",1
Super delicious Xiao Loong Baos (dumplings filled with soup base and shrimp and crabmeat). Had a great meal here and very reasonable/cheap prices. Had a short wait but was well-worth it.,1
"Food was on time and amazing!! Staying at 50 Bowery and it was very convenient. Ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings, shredded beef and jalapeño soup and the house special glazed crispy chicken. Would definitely go back as it was an amazing experience. Soup hit the spot as the weather had gotten colder and a cold started to set in. Spicy nature of the soup knocked it right out!",1
"Perhaps the best chines food I have ever eaten. Dumplings were incredible, scallion pancake blew my mind, and sweet and sour chicken and rice was delicious. Whenever I stop through NYC, I will be sure to make a stop here. The lines out the door speak to the quality of the food. Definitely stop here if you have the chance.",1
"In 1994, they opened their first Joe's Shanghai in Flushing, New York. It quickly becomes the favorite for all diners up till this day but not in flushing anymore, you'll have to travel to Bowery Street in Manhattan.

The original name for this dumpling is Xiao Long Bao, but due to the complicated pronunciation,  simply call it ""Soup Dumplings"" (based on the soup inside the dumplings). It quickly become an acronym for Joe's Shanghai. Mention ""Soup Dumplings"", everyone knows you're referring to Joe's Shanghai. 

In 1995, they opened their Chinatown restaurant in Pell Street.  However, the place proved to be too small to handle the growing capacity they have, so in December 2019, they moved to a nearby location - 46 Bowery, New York. 

Soup dumplings were delicious as always, The pan fried noodles was just not the same. So little noodles for the amount of beef and vegetables in their delicious gravy on the plate. 

They opened at 11 with a small line but within 30-40 minutes it completely filled up.",1
"This place was very good. The lo mein noodles weren't anything special, but the General Tso's chicken were definitely the best I've had. I would recommend getting that. They also give you some complimentary oolong tea.",1
"I liked how comfy this place is. I go here a lot with my friends and have never had a problem with getting seats or nothing. Food is great and it is everything you would expect out of a shanghai spot.
I think the main thing to look out for when determining a good from bad shanghai spots are the crab dumplings and this place does not dissapoint in that regard. Dip them in some vinager soy sauce and prepare to be happy.
Had to mark it down a star because like most restaurants in chinatown the utilities are not all that clean and that is absolutely gross",1
"We had the dumplings (recommended, pork), beef and broccoli, chicken and vegetables, shrimp and scallops with veggies, and general tsao chicken.  All of them were fantastic!!  The wait was quoted as 20 mins, but they got us seated in 2 mins.  The restaurant is casual but it was packed the entire time we were there.  I would most definitely go back!!  We shared a table with some locals and they ordered lo mein plus deep fried pork and it looked good too!!  Great experience, wish I could give a 6!",1
"I'm having a craving with soup dumplings. This is the place! Last time I was here, I think the rating was E? LOL. Still, there's a line.",1
"My friend hyped this place so much for their xiao long bao saying it's the best she's had in America. And it certainly lived up to the hype. We literally stopped in just to snack on some XLBs and they were super quick with service! The dumplings were huge compared to others I had, and there was something about the flavor about these that were just different and better than any other XLBs I've had anywhere else in the country. So next time I'm in NYC I have to come back to Joe's Shanghai.",1
"I came here mainly for the Soup Dumpings, So that's what I got.  2 orders of the crab w' pork Dumplings.  Soup inside was piping HOT(So be careful) and delicous, the stuffing was very flavorful.  Way better and cheaper than DTF in my opinion. Will definitely make another visit if I'm ever back in NYC.

Obviously you should be expecting a long wait time for a place with this many reviews.  I was here over the weekend when it was snowing out and the temperature was in the 1 digit.  But that didnt stop other people from coming here also.  If you come here with 2-3 people, expect to be sharing a round table with other people.  My wait time was around 20-25 minutes.  My only gripe is that if you're asking people that are waiting to wait outside, that you make the effort to go outside to call their numbers.",1
Best soup dumpling of the city.  I love the ones with crab meats.,1
"I think those who gave this place anything less than 3 stars, especially locals, are just trying to differentiate themselves from the tourists. I've had xia long bao in China, and Joe's Shanghai is certainly comparable, and definitely the best I've had in the U.S.! Sure the wait sucks and the service is horrible, but what else can you expect from a busy restaurant in Chinatown? When in New York, go.",1
"This place is in a cute little alleyway in Chinatown that looks like it could be a movie set (wouldn't be surprised if it has been.) 

The wait is extremely long, so plan ahead.

Instead of belting out synonyms for ""good,"" I'll just say this place was a 5 (Yelp) star experience.",1
Best! So good and never been disappoints. The line can be heavy on weekends but most of the time if it's just a table for two you can be in and out fairly quickly. Highly recommend.,1
"Our meal at the Chinatown outpost of Joe's Shanghai was by no means a comfortable experience.  The wait was considerably long, the place was crowded, the smell of soy sauce and rice vinegar filled the air, and we were seated on a communal round table elbow-to-elbow with three other groups, all of us pretending not to be listening to each other's conversations.

Few items are worth all the trouble.  Fortunately, Joe's Shanghai's Xiao Long Bao fits the bill - in both price and quality.   The Xiao Long Bao Joe's Shanghai were quite fantastic.  They're plump and very tasty and the skin was perfectly thin and chewy.  The soup was hot and soothing.  

Apart from the dumplings, I'm not too crazy about their other entrees, though they were still all above average, and not overly saucy.  My suggestion?  Stick with the XLB (pork and crab are both good) and walk over to Rice to Riches for some grubbin rice pudding dessert.

Also, service can be pretty frustrating.  It's not as bad as other people experienced and I think language difficulties may be perceived by others as being rude.  Regardless, you wont get the VIP treatment here, just good dumplings.  They only take cash and even add a mandatory 15% service charge, regardless of the size of your party or your order.",1
"Best* soup dumplings ever.  Don't waste your time or appetite by ordering anything else here.

The service is hit or miss, like with every establishment.  I actually got a great waiter.

The wait for a table shouldn't be surprising, considering its popularity with the tourists.  I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for 3 when I arrived at 7 pm on a Friday night, which I found reasonable.

And honestly, the complaint about the price --- where else can you get food this good and this cheap in Manhattan?  You get 8 dumplings for less than $5, if I remember correctly.

Here's a tip -- the optimum temperature to eat the soup dumpling is right below scalding.  Cold dumplings aren't satisfying, so place one order the moment you get to your table, and when you receive your dumplings, place your 2nd order.  That'll ensure that your dumplings are consumed at its perfect steaming hot temperature.  

* I consider them to be the best because they're the largest I sampled (between Joe's Shanghai, Shanghai Cafe, and Yeah Shang Hai Deluxe Corp) which means that Joe's Shanghai dumplings contain more broth, which is my favorite part!",1
"You won't be disappointed if you want some real Chinese food. Other than the famous pork bun, the other dishes are good as well. Traditional Shanghai food. Recommend for everyone.",1
"The soup dumplings were pretty good, service quick and attentive, especially for a Chinese restaurant.  We had some great prawns as well, the were in a red sauce (hot pepper prawns??), sorry I wish I could remember the name but they circle the item number of the popular dishes on the menu with ball point pen, so I think if you go with any of those items you are probably going to be OK.",1
"Fire soup dumplings, they get it right every single time. The first bite will hit you with the most delicious flavor. Go here!",1
"I heard a lot of good things about Joe's Shanghai, especially their famous Xiao Long Bao! Their authentic soup dumpling is the reasonable why we wanted to stop by and check it out. When we first arrived, we were expecting a long waiting line but we didn't see any. I thought they are closed today but turned out we were just lucky! We came in and sat down right the way around 1145. Highly recommend to come early for lunch on a weekday!!! With just two of us, we ordered the best dishes on their menu, Crab Flavored Shanghai Xiao Long Bao and Shanghai stir fried thick noodle. Omg! I love their food! So authentic that literally brought me back to the time I was visiting Shanghai!!! The stir fried thick noodles was perfectly cooked, flavorful, and just the way it should be. The crab flavored Xiao long Bao came as it finished in the bamboo steamed basket. So fresh and simply awesome. The size is bigger than I expected. The flavor and quality were also better than I expected. The crab flavored filling and soup in the Xiao long Bao were the one of the best that I've ever had! I was totally shocked by the flavor of Xiao long Bao! I highly recommend this place and I will come back every time I am in New York!",1
Loved the food...had YUMMY soup dumplings..crispy prawns ..sesame chicken. Service very good.,1
"Seriously, best soup dumplings ever! I miss the hole in the wall when you used to have to share large tables with other groups, but so happy that they had expanded to a larger location!",1
"Believe the hype, this place is amazing!!! I have gone three times within the last three weeks with three different people who all agree that this place and the food is incredible. I've ordered the pork soup dumplings, the Shanghai Style Flat Noodle and the fried dumplings each time. Definitely recommend the noodles to share!! The soup dumplings are flavorful (a bit too hot, so let them cool down a bit) so be sure to get that when you're there!",1
"If you want to spend some money on great Chinese food, and want the real Chinese restaurant experience, this is the place.  But only go with a group of people.  It's about the experience as much as the food.",1
"I have been waiting to come here and am so excited I finally got to try the soup dumplings! 

First of all they were huge! And so delicious and soupy! I only tried the pork dumplings so next time I'll have to try the crab. We also shared the Shanghai flat noodles.... YUM. I was stuffed and couldn't be happier.

Couple of things to note: if you're in a small group or pair, you will get seated with other people at your table. It's very busy and tight inside the restaurant but then again you probably know that coming in. Before even asking you what you want to drink, the server will ask you if you want dumplings lol. Oh and the food is super cheap! 

Most importantly you won't regret it. The soup dumplings are awesome and I can't wait to come back!",1
"Joe's Shanghai serves some of the cheapest soup dumplings you'll find, and they aren't bad. But for all those people out there who even try to compare this place to Din Tai Fung, it isn't even close. At about only a dollar per soup dumpling, this place is a great value and the dumplings here are soupy and flavorful, but it's a far cry from the sophisticated craft that is the world-famous Din Tai Fung soup dumpling.

We stopped by here for lunch on a Sunday, and tried their soup dumplings. Positives include the fact that they are pretty cheap, pretty sizable, and are filled with plenty of flavorful soup. Unfortunately, they lack the delicateness people love Din Tai Fung for, and the skin of the dumplings is pretty thick here. This means that the soup dumplings rarely break, but that also means the dough to soup and pork ratio is off and the dough is pretty chewy (not a good thing here). The key test these dumplings fail is that they cannot be eaten in a single bite as they are simply too large. That being said, while I've had plenty of better soup dumplings elsewhere, I've rarely had any that were cheaper.

We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, and I don't think it's worth any longer of a wait. They also add on a 15% service charge here regardless of party size, so keep that in mind. Decent cheap soup dumplings but doesn't exactly live up to the hype. 4 stars.",1
Great Soup Dumplings. New York Staple. Never close.,1
"This place is well-known for their soup dumplings, and I've visited other locations before. I recently went in with a friend to eat some soup dumplings, and they certainly were tasty, but unfortunately, they were pretty fragile. Almost all of them broke and leaked out before we could put them on our spoons. Still tasted great, but it was a bit disheartening to see all that soup gone.

We had a fairly long wait and ended up sharing a table, but it wasn't too bad. I'd go back, if only for the soup dumplings. Regular, though - I've tried the crab ones before, and they weren't great.",1
I'm from Los Angeles but I was definitely loving this place. The orange chicken was excellent and veggies were crispy. Although it was busy they were pretty efficient and didn't have to wait long.,1
The pork dumpling soup tasted...out of the world! didn't like the pancake though my husband liked both!,1
"Never disappoints. I always stop here when I'm in the city. Very good food. The soup dumplings are a must. I leave happy, full and with left overs to enjoy later.",1
"The xiao long bao at Joe's Shanghai is good but inferior to the ones at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, CA.  The juice is much tastier and the skin is thinner and less doughy at Din Tai Fung.  All in all though, still a good and cheap place for New York.",1
"Joe's Shanghai has arguably the best soup dumplings on the east coast. Thankfully, it's here in New York City else I would have to travel to Shanghai just to have these dumplings. Actually, speaking of which, I had to share a table with a family from the Midwest. He said that the entire cost of flying his family there, staying at a hotel in New York City might have been all worth it for that meal alone (more than $1000). And when given the check, he could not believe that the meal he had cost so little! Of course, that's a bit of an exaggeration. Still, it doesn't take away from the fact that the food here is very good and fairly cheap.  

To make everyone happy, you would will have to share a table with someone else. This is not unheard of in crowded restaurants in Asia, but certainly, it's something different in the US. If you wanted a table to yourself, you would either need some luck with timing or spend a long wait for one. In either case, I think it works out since the soup dumplings are so popular. They steam them in batches and if you're unlucky enough to order them when they've finished off a batch, you're in for another wait as well. In the end, the whole sharing tables idea is not so bad. 

The service here is variable. I can't seem to justify why it is exactly. But I've had better experiences coming here in the dead time in between lunch and dinner. I assume before lunch would also be good too, if I could drag myself out of bed that early. 

Joe's Shanghai has to be one of my favorite places to eat in Chinatown. It promises good food at a more than reasonable price. And more importantly, they come through! Though they have added a 15% gratuity fee, it's actually a modest sum to ask for because you certainly could feel obligated to give them more. This restaurant epitomizes the Chinatown experience as there are a bunch of restaurants in the neighborhood that are absolutely cheap, but not necessary good.",1
"The turnover here is crazy. They pop out soup dumplings like there is no tomorrow. 

The pork dumplings come out in 5 minutes or so. They are hot, the steam will burn your tongue. Eat it with a spoon and your chopsticks. Put the dumpling on the spoon, bite off the top of the dumpling. Let it cool. Pour in some vinegar. Then enjoy! The skin is not too thick, the pork actually takes like pork, and the soup is savory - what is not to like? 

Service here is fast. You ask for it, you get it a couple of seconds later. The waiters are well-versed in English (at least vis-a-vis food-related requests). However, do expect to wait to be seated. This place gets crowded quickly and waits can be up to over an hour!",1
"This place doesn't disappoint. Quick service, tasty
Food very reasonable priced. Be aware of the service fee on the check. The new location is clean",1
"If you are living or visiting NY, you HAVE to come to Joe's. The soup dumplings are the best best ones I've ever had. Each one is filled with so much flavorful broth. My sister and I ended up going twice on our quick trip. I will definitely be back next time I'm in NY.",1
"I give these five stars to what i've had at Joe's, and it's their xiao long bao's or steamed dumplings. The key is to wait for them to cool down a little, and eat the whole thing in one bite, if you let the juices flow, the dumplings aren't as tasty. I personally prefer the crab, but I've grown up with crab. I would recommend this place for a snack, and I would only recommend the dumplings, the place is so packed that you get crammed with other groups, it's nice just to dive in and out.",1
"$5-7 for an order of XLB?  Yes please.

Having always been stuck going at the wrong times with hoards of people inline, myself and Freddy Jr R were lucky to have to wait for about 20 minutes.  Family style seating, so if you're in a small group then you will be seated with other groups of people.  No biggie.  

Immediately when we sit down, the waiter already asks which dumplings you want.  You can get the regular ones for $5 or the crab ones for $7.  We order one of each as well as the pepper skin duck as well.  

XLB is a rare dish to find done well in the Washington DC area, so I'm happy to say that these live up to the hype.  I'm sure I can find better ones in the Queens Chinatown, however with our limited time frame and our apartment being in the LES, Joe's fit the bill.

The pepper skin duck was delicious too.  Cook perfectly and plenty of meat on the bones since sometimes Chinese places will give you the cheap cuts.  

Total bill was less than $30.  Had we just ate the soup dumplings, it would've been much less.  I can see myself easily taking down 4 of these soup dumpling orders if I was extremely hungry.  For two people I say 3 orders is pretty good.  Not to be missed in Manhattan's Chinatown.",1
I randomly tried this place and have been a fan since then. we had soup dumplings and it was amazing.,1
"Soup dumpings, Xiao Long Bao, Siu Loong Pau... however you like to call them, Joe's Shanghai gets 'em right.

The look and scream of my friend when he grabbed one of the dumpling and all the juices spilled out: PRICELESS

The Shanghai fried flat noodle reminded me of my grandma's cooking.  A definite PLUS.

Only negative thought: As soon as we sat down, the waiter asked what we wanted.  I asked to give us a minute and the waiter walked away looking exasperated... we know Xiao Long Baos require time to steam and that it should be ordered first if at all possible... but couldn't we first sit down and look at the menu?  Also, they tend to group you with other groups on a large table.  I guess this can't be avoided when the place is busy and there are multiple small groups (less than 6).

My friends and I looked every bit the tourist we were looking for this place (it's a decent walk from A/C/E Canal St.).  Thank goodness a local storeowner pointed us in the right direction towards Pell.  The food made this place well worth the excursion.

Food: 5/5
Decor: 3/5
Service: 2.5/5
Cost: 3.5/5",1
"I love this place. It's always super busy so be prepared to wait and unless you're with alot of people, you will be sitting with strangers.  The food is worth it tho. Do not go here and not have the soup dumplings. That is the whole point of coming here lol They are the best so far in my book. I haven't been able to find a good NJ replacement. I'm still looking.",1
"Best.Soup.Dumplings.EVER.

AND! their Spicy Pepper Salt Prawns were AMAZEBALLS.  Seriously, I'm salivating just thinking about it.....",1
"Doesn't look like much when you walk by, but the place is packed. We tried to take a # but the wait time went from 15 min to 45 min when we checked. Not sure if they gave or spot away or what, that why -1 for that. Food was good and hot as we stayed in the hotel next door. I think it would have been perfect if we could eat inside, as dim sum is as much about the atmosphere as it is about presentation. Having it in a take out contain kinda looses something.",1
"I really enjoyed the soup dumplings here. My one issue with the restaurant was that we sat at a large group table, and the other guests were tourists who asked us many questions about New York travel, which wasn't my ideal mealtime conversation",1
"Oh man! These soup dumplings were spectacular! It was my first time here and my friends had been raving about them. I was skeptical, because I've only had terrible soup dumplings. But, I've been converted. I now believe in the healing power of a solid soup dumpling!",1
"This place is SO BUSY! I went there with friends at 2:30pm on a Friday and waited for about 30 minutes outside. I like the soup bums, especially the crab meat with pork steamed ones. Six soup bums are enough for a girl. It only cost us about $7.5 per person for that meal including taxes and tips. The restaurant calculated the taxes and tips (15%) for the customers.",1
"Joe's is definitely a super popular tourist restaurant. Please note that this spot is CASH ONLY, but there are ATMs inside.

It was pretty crowded when we had went, and we waited around 20 minutes. However, once we were inside, we were served quickly. It was nice inside, and the space was very large. We ordered the steamed vegetable dumplings, flounder, fried rice, and a vegetable dish.

The flounder was delicious - it was fried and the perfect amount of salty. I thought the dumplings were decent, and were pretty standard. I am glad that I got to try Joe's Shanghai, but I think there are some other restaurants in the nearby area that are just as good, if not better!",1
"Soup dumplings are da bomb, but you'll have to wait in a queue to get in.  Go in a big group so you can try a bigger swathe of all the menu.",1
"Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings, Shanghai Fried Rice, Fresh Calamari with with Spicy Black Bean Sauce, Sauteed String Bean ($78.15): get their soup dumplings!!! This spot was pretty popular with almost every table filled when we arrived. Their soup dumplings were super super good. All the other dishes were okay and portions were on the smaller side, so I would probably just get soup dumplings next time. Dined in person! Cash only!",1
Prompt service. Wait wasn't that bad. Organized.  Food was fresh and delicious.  Steamed dumplings were amazing. Good sized portions. Clean and busy.  Highly recommend if visiting Chinatown.  Ps.....cash only,1
"I've accepted the fact that it's hard to stay ""authentic"" to your regional cuisine when the restaurant has become so incredibly popular and widespread. The food has definitely been adjusted to suit American tastes and I can taste hints of Cantonese cooking in it as well. Not that it's still not delicious but it's lost the authenticity of that region's cooking.

It also doesn't help the beginners to this cuisine that come here b/c most of the waitstaff are not knowledgeable about the menu so you won't get much help, just trust the description on the menu or look around at the delectible tasty items being brought out...buut Joe's is still far superior than its other xiaolongbao making counterparts in Chinatown. Just went yesterday for an early dinner and the place was packed, tables being shared, orders being taken at the speed of light, delicious saucy plates of food being brought to the tables.

Had the usual bamboo steamer of pork soup dumplings (no crab for me, thanks), was good but not great, the meat honestly tasted like it was frozen for at least a few days and then steamed..you can also tell because it was not that soupy. then came the scallion pancakes which I normally hate ordering, but they were suprisingly delicious and fresh, with just the right amoutn of crispy flakiness but also doughy on the inside..we also had Shanghai thick noodles which were veryyy savory but also greasy and full of MSG-ness but that's what makes it SOO DAMN GOOD. 

It his the spot for me, but my Shanghainese mom and her friend were unsatisfied, understandably so. Would I come back here again and bring friends? Of course..just not any time soon, especially since I can get something better from my Grandma's kitchen, but Joe's is still one of the handful of Chinatown places I would still recommend for a hearty lunch or dinner. If you must get authentic Shanghainese food, I don't think theres hardly any left in Chinatown so you should just cross the bridge into Flushing and eat at the little food stalls or minimalistic dumpling joints there.",1
"I literally only come here for the famed soup dumplings with the occasional side of scallion pancakes. And it's totally worth it.
This place is featured in pretty much every tourist magazine, so be sure to go at a brunch/mid-afternoon time unless you want to get a ticket stub with a number on it as you wait outside to be seated.
This place also bundles you together with other unsuspecting people in order to save space. Which is efficient, but often awkward because you don't know the person you're eating across of, and you kind of feel like you're on a blind date getting judged by hoe you eat.
But I digress.
The food here comes fast, hot, and never not-delicious. The crab-meat soup dumplings actually taste like crab!! Not imitation crab!!!! Dumpling skin is plump and the juice inside is always the right amount of bold.
I've been coming here since I was a kid, and will continue to do so.",1
"Excellent!
The Xiao Long Bao taste so good, makes you wanna slap yo momma!",1
I've been to Joe's awhile back but then I moved from NYC so it had been a few years. Decided to take my dad here when we were visiting nyc again and for one thing wow it is in a totally new location. It's much brighter and bigger inside. We were seated quickly as we didn't mind sharing tables with strangers. The soup dumplings were still delicious. We got another noodle dish that I would not get again. Just come here for the soup dumplings and you will be happy.,1
Joes Shanghai is the real deal! My nephew is from the West Coast and raves about the Shanghai Soup Dumplings in San Francisco. We were in the city for the day and planned our day around lunch at Joes! The seating is table sharing which allows for quicker availability but may be awkward for some. We ordered pork and crab soup dumplings that were absolutely amazing! I had never eaten them before but will be going back for sure to try more!! Authentic is the key word at Joes. A lot of locals eating there as well. This place is highly recommended! Give it a try!!,1
the soup dumplings are a must! there might be a wait but it is really worth it! great food and great prices,1
"Very good, and very greasy Chinese food. Great complimentary tea as well.

The soup dumplings were phenomenal, full of broth, and meat; a very savory dish.

Pan fried noodles were also great, very tasty, decent amount of meat and veggies, and noodles were perfect.

Cheap, but good Chinese food. If you're in China Town and having a hankering for some MSG laden food (just kidding), then Joe's is a great spot, especially if you want to try some awesome soup dumplings that actually have a ton of soup in them.",1
"Read the reviews and had to make a stop here. Their ""xiao long bao"" are the best in the US of A. I'm craving for more. They are not skimpy with the size and had so much soup. Other dishes were very good too, especially the onion pancake.

When are we going to NYC again, Kat?",1
"Oh, how I miss my childhood of family trips to Joe's. 

I have since found much better soup dumplings in the city, but, Joe's will forever be my initial soup dumpling love. Hailing from a Shanghainese family, I've also tried just about every other item on the menu. The food is fairly on spot with how middle level quality restaurants in Shanghai are like. 

As an adult, I've actually avoided Joe's in favor of many other restaurants and ethnic foods. More specifically, ingredients in Shanghainese food tend to be obscured and muddled by the various sauces used in the cuisine. However, I still highly recommend Joe's to friends and individuals who have not had the chance to experience what I'd consider the original Shanghainese restaurant in NYC.",1
"There is only one menu, but there should be two. One for soup dumplings and another for Chinese food; I'd only need the former.

Yes, as a dingy Chinese diner in Chinatown you're going to get relatively authentic and tasty Chinese food. However you're actually going to pay a lot for that General Tso's (or muffler), like $11.95. Or you and your friends can just show up and buy a tower (8 dumplings per bamboo steamer) of soup dumplings and call it a day.

Do that. Only that, because what else is there?",1
"Their soup dumplings are excellent. Would recommend the ones without crab. They are actually more delicious and less expensive than the crab ones. The other dishes tend to more catering towards the American palate, I.e a little greasier and saltier than I would prefer. Very tight quarters, but that's just New York.",1
"Top notch outlet.  The reviews concerning the pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao) are right on.  Absolutely delectable.    To the innocent observer, it may seem as we over-ordered (we had four orders, each with 8 dumplings) but there were five kids and four adults (and, while few were looking, I managed to take care of 8 of them myself...

Everything else we ordered paled in comparison, and was simply ""as expected"" - which was to include crispy duck, chicken chow-mein, and fried rice.

Yes, I know we ordered the most pedestrian of options, but the pork soup dumplings ought to absolve us.  

Regrettably my picture reflects an empty steamer in the foreground.  Take this to support the ""so-good-we-cleared-the-containers"" notion.

P.s., thanks to Heather Melom Encinosa & Co. for introducing us to Joe's Shanghai!",1
The interior is really nice. Everyone is friendly. But the food is why I'm writing! I've only tried the famous soup dumplings but I travel from Boston often to bring some home. Yummy,1
I'm a fan. Been here a couple of times and I do think the soup dumplings are excellent. The other food is good too.,1
Best soup dumplings I've ever had! Enough said. Plus the prices are so reasonable. Hope it doesn't change ever.,1
Food was delish and the service was good. It's kind of a pain that they only accept cash but it's do-able. The beef with string beans was amazing.,1
"The xia long bao is to die for here. Extremely thin outer layer with juicy and extremely hot meat and juice in the core. Whether it's seafood or pork, all are delicious. One can serve as an appetizer for 2 but I would definitely get at least two. One seafood and one pork.

It gets extremely busy and the seating is tight inside.

Cash only.",1
"The most succulent juicy dumplings I've ever had. Don't expect it to be a fancy place, just another Chinatown restaurant loud and crowded but worth it.",1
"always make a stop here whenever im in new york. ill admit that the dumplings are better than the din tai fung in Cali because they don't sheist you on the soup inside the dumplings as the ones in Cali are super dry. 

just be careful and SIP SLOW! i burned my tongue because i had no patience when biting into these little bundle of joys.

this is a place where you CANNOT be shy. its all communal seating. funny how you can tell who the antisocial customers are. theyre the ones who whip out their tabloid newspaper and make NO eye contact even when both sides of the table are obviously making loud a$$ slurping noises from the dumpling juice.",1
"Second time here and it was delicious, I have to say service is just not there but its typical for the area. My friend and I were a party of 2 and if you are a pair you will be seated most likely on a round table with other pairs which I didnt mind because I'm very social haha. Their is a pot of tea ready for you which I loved and they came to take our order fairly quickly within 10 minutes...I ordered the Seafood noodles and a Chefs plate of the sliced spicy beef with bean sprouts....we devoured everything! The couple next to us also ordered the beef and they thought it was too spicy, however I'm Mexican and felt it was average. Once we finished we asked for our check and didnt notice the added gratuity but what are you gunna do...good food, fairly quick and packed...good eats in Chinatown",1
"Soup Dumplings are on point. Would go there again for that. Sadly, I also got their seafood pan fried noodle and was disappointed to see it made differently than with yellow noodles. It also lacked some flavor. How we we also had the seafood flat noodle and that was delicious!",1
"by far the best experience i've ever had.
the dumpling are amazing.the scallion pancakes are awesome. in general the best dumpling place in the world.",1
"Joe's Shanghai has the best dumplings I've ever tried in New York City.  However, I'm giving it four stars for the food mainly, and not anything else.  The wait is completely ridiculous on the weekends, so definitely avoid it if you can.  I usually come here on the weekdays for a late lunch.  The waitstaff isn't the friendliest bunch, and the hostesses are kind of rude.  One hostess was actually texting on her phone while she led us to our table.  They also have added gratuity which sucks because the service definitely does not deserve the 15%.  The decor is almost nonexistent.  The food comes fairly quickly though, so that's something.  I would recommend this place only for the food because I can't find any other place with better dumplings.",1
"Having recently been to Shanghai just a year prior to coming to Joe's its safe to say that Joe's had a fairly high bar to reach. My friend and I ordered the pork soup dumplings, green onion pancakes, and pork rice cakes, all of which came out in a surprisingly quick amount of time. One thing I was slightly disappointed about was that they didn't have sheng jian bao (pan fried pork buns), which are a traditional staple of almost all Shanghainese restaurants. Regardless, the xiao long bao was so good that upon having our first bite of it, we immediately ordered another two orders of it. The soup dumplings were probably the bets I've had in the states in a long time, and are slightly larger than normal ones (not complaining lol). They're filled with just the right amount of soup: not too much as to overfill your mouth, but also not too little to leave the dumpling feeling empty. On the other hand, their green onion pancakes were a little doughy and could use more green onions in my opinion, but they also had a pleasant crisp to them and had a nice sweet soy sauce that came with it. Finally, the rice cakes were slightly overcooked and felt kinda mushy and uncomfortable to chew, but otherwise had solid flavor. Joe's is most likely famous for their XLB, for good reason, and everything else that I ordered (all traditional Shanghainese cuisine) was decent and stayed pretty close to their roots (aka not Americanized). I would recommend staying away from more Americanized Chinese options (orange chicken, general tsao's chicken, etc) and non-shanghainese food (i.e. Szechuan beef) since this is a pretty traditional Shanghainese restaurant and doesn't really specialize in those cuisines. 
5 stars for the xlb, but overall score is bumped down to 4 because the restaurant as a whole seems somewhat one-dimensional (unless they change their name to Joe's XLB or something).",1
"The pork soup dumplings are amazing! But do be careful, they are served at a mouth-scalding temperature! I like to bite a small hole in the dumpling, let some of the steam escape while balancing the dumpling on the spoon so I don't lose any soupy goodness, and then I go in for the kill! Delicious, huge, end of story.

I also tried some other dish, which was decent/whatever/unmemorable... But let's just forget about that. 

Focus on the soup dumplings! They will not disappoint you!",1
"Joe's Shanghai is the place to go in Chinatown. It's cheap, it's delicious, and they have a menu that's expansive enough that everybody in your party will be happy. I've been here many times, and my go-to is the soup dumplings.

The most important thing to know is that you should be prepared for a pretty long wait if you're here for dinner time. For a table for two, and it was not even the most crowded I've seen it, I had about a 25 minute wait. When we were able to be seated, we shared a table with 4 other people... Which was kind of tight, but I can't fault the place for being popular.

On the walls around the restaurant, there are photos of every celebrity you can think of with the owner. It's dim, it's cozy, its surprisingly quiet for a place that is standing room only. 

The food came out surprisingly quickly for a place that was this packed- and the food was good. I only come here every so often because of the weight, but I've never regretted the wait.",1
"Food (5/5 stars):
One of my favorite places to get Pork Soup Dumplings! They were much bigger than your average soup dumpling, which I appreciated.

Experience (5/5 stars):
* Price: reasonable
* Wait Time: we waited 15 min for a table after lunch hours on a weekday
* Service: good 
* Ambiance: it's a beautiful Chinese restaurant",1
"New location, seating is more spacious and comfortable, and food is great as always.  The soup dumplings are amazing of course, and I also got the Szechuan beef.  It's a bit presumptious of them to add an 18% gratuity even for a party of one, but fortunately they do have good service.  Also with the renovations they seem to have the cleanest and most modern restrooms in all of Chinatown.  Bring cash, it's cash only, otherwise I would give it 5 stars and order even more food!",1
"Apart from it's very ""UN-romantic"" seating, The food is exquisite.  AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD done right. Generous serving amount and totally Affordable. You'd have to mind the wait (at times). Just don't get upset. It's Chinatown!",1
"This is a very popular restaurant! Every time I walk past, there is at least a 20-30 minute wait, but as soon as you taste the food you will understand why! 
Most people come here for the classic pork soup dumplings, and I recommend you do the same. The soup dumplings come out plump and steaming, with plenty of soup for you to slurp up. We also ordered scallion pancakes and an eggplant dish. Dishes come in pretty big portions, so we had plenty of leftovers to take home. Service is very fast and efficient. Remember to bring cash!",1
"The soup dumplings here are the BEST! Other spots in the neighborhood have Shanghainese soup dumplings, but none of them compare to the original Joe's Shanghai dumplings. Aside from the dumplings, the other food at Joe's is just okay, in my opinion. But it's absolutely worth a trip for the soup dumplings - out-of-this-world amazing!",1
This place is ridiculously delicious.  We had the pork and crab soup dumplings are out of this world!,1
"Best soup dumplings! I always come here to get soup dumplings becuase it's affordable, the service is fast, and the soup dumplings taste amazing! The place isn't as formal as other restaurants because you share a table with other people if you don't have a large party. But if you don't mind sharing a table with strangers and are looking for great soup dumplings, this is the place to go!",1
"This place would be five stars but it felt too pricey for chinatown and they automatically include a 15% service charge which pushes the price even higher. However, definitely go to this one over the midtown location, which is even more expensive (though they might not have the service charge). Anyway, unless I was taking friends or something I would probably go to one of the 5 for $1 dumpling places instead of this 9 times out of 10.

Having said all of that, my soup dumplings were obviously amazing and my fried rice wasn't bad either. This place is family style  which is nice because it's actually less awkward eating alone here. Also watching the Asian ladies next to me eat was a good lesson in the proper consumption of a soup dumpling. On the downside, this also means that 5-7 legit Asians got to witness my shame upon accepting that I'll never succeed at chopsticks and asking for a fork.

If you're a tourist and/or independently wealthy and therefore not at work during the week 1ish-4ish on a weekday are good times to avoid some of the crowds the other reviewers mention.",1
"My experience of Joe's has always been pleasant.

Their waiters speak good english and they are very helpful.

The XLB though.. you get 8 of them per container and it is full of flavor.. YUM! Trust the orange oil XLB they are always more authentic than the cleaner ones.. 

The only downfall I have is that their XLB always have some shards of crab.. However.. I guess that is what makes them taste so authentic? haha...

Anyways, good job Joe's Shanghai!",1
"Joe knows how to make the magic happen. He knows what he's doing. 

Three beautiful, intellectual women shared a table with me, discussing how their husbands are oh-so-very close to publishing a book. They laugh, they toast to refreshing sesame noodles and delicious soup dumplings- happily giggling while they say, ""Sorry I keep squirting on you!""

STOP.

You are dirty if you thought otherwise.
(That's what she said)

Joe's a popular guy; ladies, food, beer. Who wouldn't want to be him? He has a line all the time waiting to experience his savory dishes. That pickled cabbage- oh man! Tangy and simple. The portions are just right too. It's more than the amount served for tapas/dim sum, but less than a traditional Chinese restaurant portions. This is awesome because you can try a variety of foods without having to force feed yourself and feel fat when you go shopping after (hint: do not try on clothing after lunch). To give you a better picture, 4 people ordered 8 dishes and the total was roughly $70-80. That's including tax and tip!

Joe... You da man.",1
"Came here on a Thursday night at 6p as a family of 4.  We had to wait only 15 minutes.  Its pretty cramped and loud inside but I promise you, it's WORTH it.  Their soup dumplings are probably some of the BEST you will ever have.  The soup is so flavorful and they have just the right amount of meat in it as well.  The wrapping dough is just the perfect thickness.  You MUST get this!

We also got the shanghai fried noodles, deep fried buns that you dip in condensed milk, and fried green beans.  We really liked how the fried green beans were not overly salty but just perfect (some places I feel like over season this dish).

Definitely COME EARLY.  As we were leaving (around 7p), there was a huge crowd waiting outside!",1
"I love this place! We ordered the crispy Shanghai pan fried noodles with beef, Pork soup dumpling, sweet & sour fried pork, and Shanghai fried flat rice with beef. If you go for dinner on Fri, Sat, or Sunday be prepared for a 30-45 min wait. Plan accordingly and you'll be fine.",1
"Great place, cheap food, crowded atmosphere, worth the wait.

It's a great place good cheap eat, but do know that there is almost always a line to eat here. 

Famous for their steamed buns, you can't go here and not eat it!
I also highly recommend their garlic eggplant dish, really good! I don't like eggplant and that dish made me love eggplant. 

It'll be crowded in there and if you go with 2-3 people, chances are you'll sit at a round table with 2-3 people you don't know, but that's part of the experience. Great place!

If you want the same thing, but in a ""finer"" restaurant, they have another location in Midtown. Prices there a little bit more expensive, and I don't think the food's as good, but it's an alternative!

Enjoy",1
"This place is known for their dumplings, and you know what, they're a pretty good deal -- as in their cheap. Are these comparable to Shanghai or even Din Tai Fung.. maybe not but not a bad effort.

The problem with the dumplings is their skin. It is way too thick to be considered Xiao Long Bao; they actually give you EDGED TONGS to pick them up which just goes to show how durable that skin is. I have honestly never seen tongs used to pick a Xiao Long Bao up. 

This might be due to the learning curve and delicate hands one must have to eat one of these dumplings. Usually you use chopsticks to pick it up gently and put it into a soup spoon, pour some vinegar/ginger on top, and bite off a small piece of the skin to drink the soup inside. Usually the skin is much thinner and delicate that many times, the dumpling does not make it into the soup spoon fully intact.

Taste-wise, the dumplings (both crab/pork and pork) were good. Be careful when drinking the soup inside because it does come out piping hot.

I also ordered the Peking Style Minced Pork Noodles that were in a slightly spicy peanut tofu sauce, which was pretty good. Also good were the fried green beans (si ji dou / four season bean).

Like other places in Chinatown, you're most likely going to have to share a communal table because there are a predominance of huge family style 10-12 seat round tables at this place so just beware of that before coming.

Even though the texture and flavor aren't as good as I've had, the prices just can't be beat. Given that an order of 8 dumplings will set you back $5-7, it's really hard to complain that much.",1
Really good. The pork dumplings are a must and by far the best I've ever had. If you have a small party the wait isn't bad. You do sit with other small parties as well. Be prepared to know what you want when you arrive. They want you in and out. We also tried General Tso's Chicken with vegetable lo mein. Enjoyed both entrees. Cash only and tip will already be included.,1
"You wait in line a while to get in this place. The primo is their steamed dumplings, which are excellent and stack up against the best I had in China.  The grilled green beans were also excellent.  The noodles were meh.  Service is great and people really seem to be having a good time there.",1
Always get the classic xiao long bao and noodle sticks! You can never go wrong with it. Be prepared to wait and don't be shocked if the make you share a table with strangers!,1
No credit cards accepted.  Very good but small place.  You will be seated at a table with other people.  The food is very authentic and good.  Prices are reasonable.,1
"Came here with two friends. Wait is about an hour depending on when you come. This place was on my dumpling roadmap so while we waited we walked over to try Nice Green Bo. Between the two, I would have to pick Joe's Shanghai. When you first enter Joe's, they greet you and give you a ticket. They call out ticket numbers whenever a table is available. Really busy on a weekend morning/afternoon. I ordered the pork soup buns and the crab soup buns. I like the texture of the dumpling wrap. It's not as thick as Nice Green Bo. But the soup buns are pretty salty. I probably chugged a glass of water for every 4 buns I ate. If I have to choose between the pork or crab soup buns, I would pick the pork one all the time. P.S. BE CAREFUL TO NOT BURN YOURSELF BY STUFFING THE WHOLE THING IN YOUR MOUTH! Definitely be coming back again.",1
"We stopped at Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown for a quick dinner before heading home after an exhausting day in downtown NYC! As usual the place is packed but we were able to grab a table on the second floor.  The service is diligent and quick and the food is always fresh and delicious!  After having spent the entire day enjoying different small plates in various places in Little Italy where we joined the celebration of the Saint Genaro Feast, we kept our dinner selection light.  My husband and I shared the combination Pork and Crab Soup Steamed Dumplings and Crispy Shrimp dish as the Entrée served with white rice.  Steamed soup dumpling is the signature dish at this restaurant and I concur!  They are light pillows of dough with a tasty meaty filling enveloped in a liquid sauce which characterizes the dish..  Delightful!  I can make a meal just of these!!!  I do prefer the pork dumplings to the crab ones, though... but they are both great!!!  The shrimp dish turned out to be in a spicy semi-sweet garlicky sauce which went absolutely well with the white rice.  This restaurant never disappoints!  When you are in the area and in the mood for great steamed soup dumplings do not hesitate to give Joe's Shanghai a try!",1
"I found myself exploring China Town for the first time and decided to pop into Joe's Shanghai.
There was a wait, but since I was a part of 1, it took about 15 minutes for me to be seated.
I ordered the house glazed crispy chicken which was a large portion, and I also ordered the wonton soup which was a GINORMOUS PORTION.
Being solo, I finished about 1/2 of the chicken and maybe 1/4 of the wonton soup.

I can't tell you what all is in that glaze for the chicken, but it is SO flavorful. Not so rich that it's overpowering, but just the right balance of sweet/savory. There were plenty of veggies with it too - that's a bonus to me. The breading was indeed crispy, not soggy like so many breaded chicken dishes in sauce that I've had at other establishments outside China Town.
The chicken was tender, and the dish was hot & freshly made.

The wonton soup was everything a wonton soup should be: the dumplings were full as could be, and the broth was a great hearty flavor. No watery soup here!

My only lamentation is that I wish I could have taken the rest to go, but alas I wasn't going to be able to carry it around with me for the rest of the day.

Side note: This place is cash-only, so bring cash or be prepared to use the ATM in the foyer.",1
"Honestly I am obsessed with this place. My boyfriend and I come here whenever we get a craving for some soup dumpling. They are to DIE FOR here (the pork is better than the pork+crab meat tbh). You get 8 for like $7, can't beat it. We also get pan fried pork dumpling which are also to die for, and if we're feeling extra hungry we split a plate of chow or lo mein (big portions). The bill is never over $30! Can't go wrong!

Be prepared to wait if you come on a saturday afternoon, and you sit at a big round table with strangers! Its not terrible tho, food is worth it.",1
"The soup dumplings here are 10/10. We also got the pan fried noodles. I could just eat the soup dumplings forever, they are big and have a lot of soup in them.

My sister and I ate here multiple and times and doordashed multiple times during our one month stay in NYC.

They're also open for in person dining late night.",1
Food was good. Service not the greatest but I already knew that coming in. Overall it was a good meal,1
"Really good good here! We had the crab and pork dumplings, shredded beef, scallion pancake, and vegetable fried rice. I think the beef was my favorite. Scallion pancake was crunchy. The restaurant moves quickly too. We didn't wait long for all dishes to come out. I used a ton of the chili oil and my water was refilled right on time and frequently. Only note is the fried rice was missing some flavor. I used all the other sauces on the table to make it better. Regardless will definitely come back.",1
"The only reason to come here is for the xiao long bao. You can order XLB with pork or crab. We tried the crab and it was very ""soupy"" which is good. We got a few other dishes too (onion pancake and seafood noodles), but both were mediocre. If I were to come back, I would only order XLB and nothing else.

Luckily, we came at 4:00 pm so there was no wait. We had to share a table with another party and when they left, another party joined our table, but it was ok.",1
"The soup dumplings really do live up to the hype. We got both the pork and the seafood ones; I liked the pork better but they were both great. You have to be very careful when picking up a dumpling though because a few broke open when we tried picking them up with the tongs. Also, the soup dumplings were actually listed as ""buns"" on the appetizer part of the menu and not as ""soup dumplings,"" FYI. 
I also ordered the spring roll, which tasted great, but the portion was so tiny, it's not worth it.
This place is cash only!",1
"I looove the food! Really traditional Chinese food, not American Chinese and the price is really good!
Probably my preferred Chinese restaurant. Sure I will be back!",1
"Do I even have to review this place? There's already so many...
I've been here probably 5-8 times and every experience has been similar so I guess I owe a review.
You're always going to wait to get in because it's so poppin' (and worth it). You can get seated right away IF you get there right when it opens.
Because of the amount of space available and popularity of the place, you'll most likely be seated at community tables with other guests, which is cool. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the smaller tables to yourself and your peoples. 
I would say that the service could be better because they seem to rush everything and try to get everyone in/out ASAP that they forget to be more accommodating. But, food comes out quick!
Must order: Soup dumplings! I wish they had veggie soup dumplings available.
I've tried multiple noodle dishes, and none have disappointed. I'm just going to say that you won't go wrong with any dish you order.",1
Awesome soup dumplings. They were big and really cheap! We also tried fried rice and husband got a chicken dish. Everything was great but such big portions. It was kind of nice though because we ate our leftovers when we got back to our hotel.,1
"We went all over NYC looking for food and this was by far my favorite restaurant that I tried while in NYC. The XLB were phenomenal. The dumplings were juicy and flavorful. The only downside to this restaurant was the wait to get inside. Would I do it again? Hell, yes.",1
"I am definitely going there again. You know it is a good asian restaurant if you see white people. 
I had Soup Dumpling from China to US. 
This is the Best Soup Dumpling I ever had! Get the Crab and Pork. (Better than Shanghai, China's)
Try it with the Vinegar and EAT the CABBAGES after you are done with soup dumplings!!!!


Also the Cold noodles was the one of best had. No offense, Better than what my Mom make. And we were from Shanghai.",1
"I usually avoid touristy places but this place was too good to ignore, delicious, and it reminds me of my grandmother's cooking. If you're visiting New York City , this is a must go. P.S the Soup dumplings are the main focus , it should be the first thing you order there",1
"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city. Although this isn't the original, iconic location down in Chinatown, the more upscale midtown option is in some ways even better. With table cloth covered tables and reservations, you don't have to deal with the long line outside a shady block. Although the dim sum options are limited, the few options they have are absolutely delicious. All of the standard American-Chinese dishes are delectable as well.",1
"I came here from a friend's recommendation. The dumplings were excellent! Especially the soup inside, I haven't taste a better place yet other than here. I personally like the pork crab one better :P The waiter took our orders quickly before getting our tables settle down, so the food came really fast!

*drool..* why can't you have on in sf? :T",1
"Joe's Shanghai has always been my family and I's favorite Shanghainese restaurant. My husband and I came here on our very first lunch date 18 years ago at their old location on Pell Street and decided to check out their new location for lunch again (we used to go to their Flushing loc too but unfortunately, they closed). We got all the signature dishes ranging from crab/ pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, Shanghai fried rice and fried rice cake with beef. This place has the best soup dumplings with perfectly thin skin, flavorful broth and just enough meat filling. 

All the other dishes were also cooked to perfection and food came out as quick as humanly possible. The customer service was near perfection with both water glasses and hot tea always remaining full without us having to ask. Parking can be a nightmare and there can be a slight wait due to covid occupancy limits. We went around 1 and waited only about 5 minutes or less. Besides that, this should be every person's go-to Shanghai restaurant when that craving arises. FYI: cash only and there's a 15% service charge, which is automatically added to the total bill.",1
"Joe's is a fantastic restaurant.  Table for 2? The restaurant sits you at a table for (?)people warmly sit together, showing me friendship to be or not? I always find other soup-dumplings. 16 Pell St -》 for your feet, etc, then you cross the narrow street literally, and eat, and eat...! Delicious,  perfect seasoning, never rushed! I wish they would deliver to Brooklyn! Easy enough to take home. One (1) train, all the way! Listen to  ,  and in a click, you're in CHINATOWN.  A DAY OF YUMMY FOODS@Joes, , A FOOT RUB at Heaven,. Extended to your wishes! 16 Pell Street is the start for your tired feet. Then, a meal of your choice!! You will never forget; you'll be back!  I hope you love this ""day"" as much as I do!!",1
"I had the (crab) soup dumplings, absolutely delicious!  And cheap!  I'd eat this everyday if I could.  I don't care much for the vinegar sauce.",1
pork soup dumpling was maybe the best thing i had on this trip. so much better than expected. i don't even really like soup. servers don't seem to be friendly but thats normal service for me when we are talking any restaurant in any chinatown.,1
"I was told to visit Joe's Shanghai to try their infamous soup dumplings! It was a beautiful day in Chinatown and I have arrived at the restaurant to find a busy and loud atmosphere. Plenty of servers running back and forth removing plates from tables and I could see the dumplings already on many tables being eaten. I was very eager to be sat and order and to my surprise we were given a table almost immediately. 
    My friends and I sat next to a couple who had already eaten most of their dumplings. I asked if they were the famous dumplings everyone talks about and the couple insisted that we try and finish the rest of their dumplings. We were shocked and accepted their generosity to try them. The hype was so true! The dumplings were delicious! I immediately ordered a fresh order for myself. A few minutes later they were placed right in front of me hot and steaming. I carefully placed this new hot steaming dumpling onto my spoon and began to slurp all the juices that were spilling from the doughy surrounding. The inside was filled with pork which was very flavorful and pleasing. I could eat these dumplings all day. They were one of the best things I've ever tried. If you're going to visit Joe's Shanghai you won't be disappointed with the dumplings. I'll be sure to return when I am in New York City again.",1
"I love these soup dumplings. When I used to live near the financial district, I would stop by here for lunch with my roommates. I have never been disappointed here. The only thing is the restaurant can be a little messy but it is still cleaner than most of the other Chinatown restaurants.",1
Excellent food.  Had the fried rice with dry scallops. Excellent and light on the oil. Snow pea sprouts very good. Splurged on shrimp with walnuts.  Can't go wrong.  Could mix of Chinese patrons meaning it's close to the real thing. Will go to Uncles again,1
You will not have better Chinese food in your life. I felt like the parents that turned into pigs in the movie Spirited Away. I could not stop eating.,1
"Perfect Chinatown restaurant with friendly staff and quick, attentive service.  All the food was on point, hot and delicious.  Facility was very clean.  4 stars for being cash only, otherwise a 5!",1
Shrimp rice cakes may be my new favorite food. Got this place delivered to upper east side on Friday and the soup dumplings and shrimp rices cakes were to die for!,1
"Big juicy dumplings. It's standard - great but not amazingly good. It's what a dumpling place should taste like. The wonton has more dough than what I would normally like. I also got the spicy fish fillet w rice. Super spicy and good! I rather go to Din Tai Fung but for the price point here, you can't really complain.",1
"Got seated after waiting for only 10 minutes which was great. However, the compromise was that the seating area was super crowded and my table was only like 1 foot away from the table next to me. I could easily hear the conversation of the couple next to us. 

Besides that, the food was delicious and the servers were attentive. I loved the soup dumplings and flat noodle dish. The spring rolls were a bit too greasy for me but yummy overall.",1
"Wow this is a truly amazing restaurant. Their dumplings are bar none! I went one night with some buddies of mine and was totally blown away. The people who run this joint are also super amazing, totally unexpected and five stars every time!!",1
"Everything I ate was amazing. I cant stop dreaming about the scallion pancakes and the dumplings.

I also really enjoyed the community style dining.I read a lot of reviews about ""awkward"" seating and conversations and I just think its a sad reflection on society. People rather stick with their small groups than have a chance to experience something different.",1
"Always delicious dumplings and decent food. I bring friends from out of time for the experience of shared tables, rude wait staff and yummy dumplings.",1
"Does this restaurant need a review?  Of course! They have moved about 2 blocks from its prior location, offering much more space and the requisite social distancing. The food has NOT changed, and that's a good thing! The soup dumplings are still out of this world. The rest if the menu is also thumbs up. Remember, they are CASH ONLY, don't get caught unexpectedly and having to use the ATM at the door.",1
Great soup dumplings or Xiao Long Bao! The pork ones were my favorite. The dumpling wrapper were thin but were strong enough to handle the soup. We also had the Seafood fried flat noodles. They were delicious as well! Will be returning,1
"You know when you go back to this place twice in the row for dumplings, that this place is good. We actually did that and ""yes"" it was the best dumplings that I have ever eaten in the states. We ordered a couple of orders to start which comes in a basket of 10 and trust me, when you start eating them - they go fast. 

Every dumpling is steamed perfectly, cooking in it's natural juices until you release the juices by putting them in your mouth. The key is to pick each of the dumplings and let the soup-base juice drain in your spoon.

Don't be surprised when a total stranger sits with you, sharing a table is common especially during lunch time.",1
"Excellent variety of Chinese food. Everything you order there is good and believe it or not, I'm not a Chinese food fan but this place is phenomenal. 
The crowd is big everyday so expect a wait of 20-30min. more or less. The line goes outdoors but it moves given the space in the restaurant is a descent size and you usually share tables there.",1
"Best place EVER!!! Been going there for years and the new location is super easy to get to.  This is a must have place as their soup dumplings are as good as those from Taiwan

A must have in your list of places to go",1
"This is a legitimate Chinese place. But with flavors that aren't too foreign, it is easy for tourists to enjoy themselves while having a new experience. I would definitely recommend the soup dumplings, because that's something that you can't experience at your corner Chinese restaurant. That is, unless, you live in china town in NYC.",1
"I dare you to find better soup dumplings than here .
Decor very simple but who cares when the food is perfection.",1
The wait....sucks.  The food.....AWESOME!  Best soup dumplings in American.  And those sauteed green beans are nomz too.,1
"Joe's Shanghai was my first ever experience with soup dumplings and I was not disappointed. So yummy! We also had the soft shell crab and a soup of some kind, which were both just as delicious. The bill was very reasonable too.",1
Above average Chinese food and I'm super picky. Good prices!,1
"Dang it.  The white people have discovered it, and now the lines are super long.

For those who haven't been there, be prepared to share a table and wait a long time for it.  I think it is totally worth the wait though.  I think the lines are better if you go for lunch/brunch, not dinner.  Waiting around in the street in sketchy chinatown is also not advised anyways..

A basket of pork XiaoLongBao was about 5 dollars.  That's ridiculously cheap.

I also really loved the flavor of their beef ChaoNianGao--I think it translates to rice cake in english?  If anyone knows a place that does ChaoNianGao as good as Joe's, please let me know.

And the ConYouBing (scallion pancakes) were super good too.  2.65 for six slices.  I might just go there for a snack one day...",1
"It is a given to most New Yorkers that this is where you go for the best soup dumplings. For the newbies of soup dumplings, it can be a challenge, so please follow these steps:

1. Order the crab pork soup dumplings with a side of scallion pancakes.

2. On your spoon, carefully tear your soup dumpling with your teeth (without letting the steam fog your glasses or burning your lip). OR be smart and poke a hole with a chopstick. 

3. Sip the heavenly goodness. 

4. Put some sauce on it, if you choose, and devour the rest of the dumpling.

There you have it! I only wish someone taught me how to eat these things many years ago. I would have not wasted all that precious broth or suffered from minor burns!",1
"Right in the middle of China town Joe's serves great and fast shanganiese food. Line seemed long but it moved fast. Tables are communal and waiters are immediately in your face asking you what you want so you better be ready to order. We tried the pork steamed dumplings, spicy garlic scallops and shrimp with steamed vegetables. Food was served within minutes of sitting down, the dumplings were the best for sure and the broth was good. They only take cash so make sure to hit the ATM before getting there. Not the best Chinese food I've had
But over all it was a good experience.",1
"Didn't expect it but, Joe's Shanghai was actually something else. The value is exceptional. The most flavorsome dish was Lo Mein, me and my friend genuinely loved it. It was so yummy. Team: perfect. Attentive and professional. What an amazing find Joe's Shanghai is.",1
authentic but expensive on cash. xiao long bao is defnitely the awesome,1
"Joe's Shanghai has the best xiao long baos in NYC. Being from Shanghai myself, I had to come and see what this city had to offer - in the sense of Shanghainese food. I was not too excited about seeing this place, as it was not in the best neighborhood, but I quickly realized my suspicions were not confirmed. This happened as soon as I sat down. I came for dinner on a Saturday, and I had been walking a lot. The staff understood our pressures to get good food after a long day. Overall, not going to this place and eating the XLB would be like living in a house without a roof.",1
The soup dumplings were amazing here!! The place has gotten much busier since the last time my husband came and you can expect a short wait or to be seated with strangers. However the food does not disappoint and is worth it :),1
"First time here!! The wait is long on the weekends, not sure about the weekdays. Once you're sat down, menu comes out, food comes quick. We ordered and the food arrived in about 5 minutes. We got the Pork Dumplings 5/5, Scallion Pancakes 4.5/5 (could've used more scallions but that's just for my own liking, otherwise, very crispy), and then we got the Peanut Noodles 4/5 (they're very good, but it's super filling since the noodles and sauce were so thick) - I mixed with their soy sauce which was really good. The place overall is very nice, and very crowded. The bathrooms are downstairs. Women's restrooms has three stalls, not sure about Men's.",1
Great food. Long line no reservation. Soup dumplings are incredible and their rice! CASH ONLY,1
"I have nothing to add to the conversation concerning the soup dumplings. They are the reason I was back to eat at this place. I brought my wife this time because she and I both thought that she would love them as well but alas, it wasn't to be. All the better, that just left me to eat both shares :-). What I would like to mention is the braised pork shoulder. It was divine!!!  The flavor was rich and well developed. The portion was easily enough to feed two. Of course I will admit to a bit of a prejudice, for I believe that there is little to not love about any part of the pig but this dish elevated the shoulder to unbelievable heights. It was so tender that a knife was superfluous. Absolutely falling apart melt in your mouth. The fat and connective tissue had rendered out every last bit of goodness they had to offer. I am drooling just remembering it. 
Yes, the place is a hole in the wall on a small back street (am tempted to use the word alley). Yes, there is a wait at the busy times of the day. Yes, there can be language barriers. Yes, you will eat family style with perfect strangers. Yes, it is wonderful!!",1
"HELLO SOUP DUMPLINGS!!! *DROOOOOOOOOL*

I had one request while visiting China Town...soup dumplings. My friend (the New Yorker) took me to this place, and boy was it worth it. We didn't wait long, but there were a ton of people in the restaurant already so we were really glad they were able to seat us right away.

I can not tell you how DELICIOUS those dumplings were. I tried the pork dumplings and the scallion pancake thing. They both come with these sauces and each sauce complimented each dish so perfectly. I'm seriously salivating just thinking about it. Both were really amazing!! I really enjoyed my experience here, and the service, for an Asian place, was actually really great! 

I will definitely have to come back to Joe's the next time I'm in NY! Can't wait!!!!!",1
"Best place to go if you have a xiao long bao craving.  As a 5 foot 2 happa I can eat about 2 orders by myself.  That's how juicy and delicious they are.  I prefer the classic pork as opposed to the crab, solely because they are the tiniest bit fattier and make the soup that much tastier.  The scallion pancake was meh, a little dense and a little too oily from over frying.  Skip them and just order the soup dumplings.  

Having been to Din Tai Fung in Shanghai, I can say these are not the best soup dumplings I've ever had, but definitely the best I've had in New York thus far.  

Don't bother with the tongs because they'll puncture the wrapper and lose all the delicious soup!  Brush up on yo' chopstick skillz if you aint asian, because there is a proper way to eat a soup dumpling (grab the top, bite a hole in bottom, drain out soup to spoon, drink soup, eat dumpling, add vinegar as desired).  Don't try and eat it all at once because I guarantee you'll burn your tongue off.  

Easiest to go if you go with a small group since they seat you at large tables with other parties.

Cash only, but at less than 5 bucks for a steamer of xiao long bao, you won't be needed much of it.

And gan bei cause it's BYOB.",1
classic - i would eat breakfast and dinner here four times a week if i lived closer - definitely great for the winter evenings.,1
This is my favorite place to get Chinese in NYC. Everything here is good and I really recommend. it's authentic and the taste is phenomenal. I always crave it when I'm in the city. I think it' better than Din Tai Fung because this place has more options.,1
"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of Joe's Shanghai at first. I walked up and there were about 10 tourists waiting to eat here (OK OK and there were lots of white people inside which I generally take to a be a ""this is not authentic asian"" sign). After waiting about 10 minutes, my friend and I were sat at a communal table with 4 other diners. I'm actually kind of glad we shared a table because the people next to us got this awesome looking fish dish which we also ordered. It was a steamed sea bass with ginger and green onions. The fish was really tender and flavorful. Good dish. 

We also ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings (shao long bao) and they were good. They certainly weren't the best I've ever had but definitely in the ""better"" category of the many I've sampled in Manhattan's Chinatown. Flushing is a whole other ballgame obviously. We weren't really all that hungry so we ordered soup - mustard greens with pork. It was decent - not all that exciting, but it was light if that's what you're going for. 

The server was surprisingly friendly and actually gave me another Chinese restaurant recommendation (I think it was because I spoke Mandarin with him?) 15% gratuity is included in the bill. You pay up at the front and get shooed out for the next customers. 

Summary? It's cheap and hits the spot.",1
Alotnof people avoid this place claiming it to be overpriced and a tourist trap. I disagree. The Soup Dumplings are the best in Chinatown. The crab one has roe in it and is full of crab. The Rice cakes was the best dish I had that day. N one makes it like Joe's,1
"Amazing Pork Soup Dumplings , Crispy Pan Fried Noodle w Beef . Also try the Chicken & Green Beans w. Garlic Sauce. Consider this your inside Scoop.",1
"THIS IS THE REVIEW I WAS TALKING ABOUT FROM THE SECRET BAR DOWN 2 streets from here!

I LOVE THE DUMPLINGS!!!! anyone that visits ny, chinatown should come here for them!!!!!

they also give great service and try their best focusing when they are so busy.",1
Soup dumplings!  That is about all that needs to be said. If you are a fan of soup dumplings this is the place to get them and it is well worth the wait.,1
"I'm not an expert but I've eaten A LOT of chinese food in my life.  Anytime I get an out of towner to visit and they like Chinese this place is the place.  I have never had anyone say that it wasn't the best.  Yea, yea the soup buns are delicious.  I like the string beans szechuan style.  You can't go wrong really..",1
"The restaurant is in an alley. Despite the location, there was a crowd of people, which made us reluctant to wait. However, after having to track down the waitress with the seating list, we literally got seated right away.

It was uncomfortable sitting with other groups but everyone got used to it.

The servers were actually pretty nice/helpful, though sometimes hard to grab their attention. The waitresses handling the people were actually the ones more hostile. 

We tried the crab soup dumpings, pork soup dumpings, and scallion pancakes.
We were stuffed by the end of it. All were pretty tasty, but too much..I was crying for hot sauce by the end of it. As the restaurant isn't all that clean, I opted out of using the sketchy old-looking bottle of hot sauce in the middle of the table. 

Be careful to not burn your tongue from the soup from the dumpings! If I had to choose between the two types, I would order the crab. The scallion pancakes would also be a great appetizer to share among multiple people.",1
Delicious as always! Soup dumplings or xiaolongbao are always the way to go! Our neighbors had a dish I hadn't seen on the menu that we decided to try which was amazing. Ask for beef or pork rice cakes. My only complaints are they really try to hussle you out and it's overpriced for Chinese food (they charge for the rice). We split around three dishes for three people and it came out to $21 each. The fact that they carry Tsingdao makes up for it. Oooo also make sure to order the eggplant (qiezi). Mmmmm,1
If you don't mind sharing the extra seat at your table with a stranger then this place is a must for Dim Sum.  We are definitely going back!,1
Went two nights in a row. I have been dreaming about the soup dumplings. Just know that if you are going solo or in a small group you will most likely be sat with other people at a large table. Was awkward but then I made friends!,1
"Such a small store for such popularity! Holler from Sunny San Diego!

Pros:
- Amazing Xiao Long Bao. The crab one and the other ones were amazing. GET THESE if you dont know what you're doing! You wont be disappointed!
-Prices are okay. Not too expensive but not cheap either.

Cons:
- If you are in a small party and there's another small party at a big table. They will put you with them. Kind of randomly awkward (it worked out for us because they were nice and offered us some of their food).
- Their Beef Noodle Soup was okay. Nothing special. 

I will come back if I'm ever back in NYC :)",1
"I just have a question , does anyone here know what brand of rice Joe's Shanghai uses? I've been wanting to know for some time now. Come here at least once a month, great soup dumplings.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is just simply wonderful. The price was super reasonable - I couldn't believe it! Joe's Shanghai had incredible food, I really liked their Sesame Chicken. The greatest part of the experience was the service. We will most certainly be back!",1
"Come here for the Xiao Long Bao (XLB's/Soup Dumplings).

There is almost always a line to get in here. You may have to share a table with another family. 

They offer crab meat, pork meat, and crab/pork dumplings. I enjoy the pork ones a bit more. Two orders of soup dumplings was enough for the four of us. Each order comes with about eight.

I have ordered some of their other dishes in the past and was unimpressed by them. Therefore, I come here primarily for one thing. 

The soup dumplings make a nice meal, but they also serve as a wonderful appetizer. We usually come here for appetizers, then go to another restaurant around Chinatown for a full blown meal.

{Note} Cash Only",1
"$5 Soup dumplings all day! So good, it will be worth the wait. Just avoid the busy times where everyone and their tourist mother also wants to go. It's an experience. Great to take out of towners to as well.",1
"Me and my mom went to this restaurant at 4 on a Thursday and there was still a line to enter and to get a seat.

Atmosphere:
-It is crowded it this restaurant but it's expected.
-There is a high chance that you would have to share a table with other diners.
-There were pictures of famous celebrities that visited this restaurant hanging up all over the walls, so that was pretty neat.

Service:
-The greeter was very friendly considering how many guests she must see everyday.
-The food came out fast.

Food:
-Sliced Braised Beef Noodle Soup ($6.25)
-The noodles were so smooth. I loved how the meat was so tender that it would just melt in my mouth. Since these were the same price as the soup dumplings I would rather just get another tray of dumplings instead.
-Pork Steamed Buns (8 for $6.25)
The famous soup dumplings! When I was picking the dumplings up, the skins kept breaking which was a disappointment but based on the other times that I've been here, this is rare. I probably just got a bad batch. The meat filling of these dumplings were very generous compared to other restaurants. I would recommend trying the dumplings with the vinegar that they provide, it gives it a different taste and you might like it more than the regular version.

Me and my mom decided that the next time we come to this restaurant, we would prefer getting two orders of the soup dumplings instead. I highly recommend you to visit this restaurant, especially if you like soup dumplings.",1
"The soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai is well worth whatever wait is required at the door.  The soup dumplings are the main attraction of this place.

When you first go in, you have to give your name/# of party to the woman at the front with a clipboard.  (Note: you have to go back to her after a few minutes to confirm that you are still there and haven't left in order to secure your spot.  Otherwise, your name gets crossed off apparently)

When you finally make it in, they seat you at one of the big round tables.  You WILL sit with other people you don't know.  Could make for an interesting story or two (:

When I come with my friends, we always get a few orders of the pork dumplings and a lo-mein dish.  I also tried the kung pao chicken here, which is pretty good.  The dish portions are generous, but they charge extra for rice, fyi. Be careful of the hot soup dumplings! There's a certain finesse to eating these not-so-little (perfectly sized actually) morsels of delight. Poke a hole in the top to let out some of the heat/steam.  I like biting the whole top layer off and sipping some of the hot soup out and then devouring the rest once it's cooled down.  Yum! (:",1
"My idea of Chinese food is golden fingers and fried rice. So when I came here with friends, I was kind of apprehensive about what I'd eat. 

Food - Delicious. Ive never liked dumplings of any kind, and didn't think I would like them here. I couldn't get enough! You have to get them if you come here. Our General Tso's and some noodle dish were delicious as well. Everything is served family style. 

Service - quick, not much else to say.

Atmosphere - Much like Chinatown itself: hectic and busy. If you come here with more than 5/6 people, chances are you are not eating together. There are communal tables. If you come with 7 people, and there is a table with 5 seats open, guess what? 5 people from your party are sitting there, and the other two are sitting someone else. Unsure if they take reservations, though. Our party of 4 sat at a table with two other ladies, which worked in our favor. Said ladies taught us how to eat the dumplings, and what was good here.

I was very pleased with my experience here, and will definitely be back when I'm in the area. Check it out, if you haven't been.",1
"Me and my friend stumbled on this place while walking through chinatown. Definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to. Be sure to get the dumplings, they're amazing and really cheap.",1
"There are certain things that I have heard over the years and always held off on believing. One is how wonderful the Chinese food in NYC is. This place made me a believer. 

The pork soup dumplings were unbelievably good. I'd never had anything like them before. They were delicate little pillows filled with the most flavorful broth and perfectly seasoned pork I've ever tasted. The ginger soy sauce they serve on the side added a sweet and salty component that made the things just sing!

Then we got the Beef and Broccoli and Kung Pow Chicken and both were simply fantastic too. Rich brown sauce that wasn't a gelatinous mess like so often I've found. Then the broccoli was fresh and crunchy that was a great compliment to the beef.

The King Pow Chicken....wow! So good. So flavorful and just the right amount of spice too. 

Seriously the meal was just wonderful. Great food, great service and honestly great prices too. Three people ate dinner for about $40! If I lived here I'd be a regular customer.",1
"This place is CASH ONLY, which is to be expected when you're in Chinatown. But fret not, they have an ATM machine right outside if you don't have any. I've seen my friends frequent this place and finally decided to go with them. We made the mistake of going on a Saturday night and the regular 15-20 minute wait turned into an hour long wait. I'm not complaining about the wait time, I completely understand, but I think they need a better system of seating people or at least informing people that it's not just based on the number you're given but also how many people are in your party. I felt bad for the hostess because people kept pestering her about tables when their number was skipped and she was getting really confused and frustrated which in turn made the customers even more frustrated. 

After finally being seated, we each ordered the regular pork soup dumplings, beef fried rice, sautéed string beans with minced pork, and a beef noodle soup.  The portions were huge! We had to take half of our food home. The soup dumplings were bigger than I anticipated and were delicious. The pricing was very reasonable as well; $6.75 for 8 pieces. I enjoyed the orange slices that they gave us at the end. 

Service is typical of Chinatown, they want you to be in and out so they can get as many people in. Food came out quick and plates were whisked away as soon as they empty. But even with the quick service, we felt relaxed and were able to enjoy our food. 

Overall, I definitely would recommend this place for anyone looking for soup dumplings in Manhattan. But I suggest coming on a weekday or some time earlier in the day. or prepare to wait for a while. I also would love to see a better system for those that are waiting to be seated and when they do, I'll give them the extra star.",1
"Food is better than average. My kids enjoyed it. We got scallion pancakes, pork & crab dumplings, beef Lo-mein & shrimp fried rice. The Lo-mein had a good quality beef & the noodles were thicker than a standard Chinese take out which I prefer. The rice was average with petit shrimp. We enjoyed both dishes. The hits for our table were the dumplings & pancakes. My children have advanced taste pallets so getting them to try & enjoy the dumplings/pancakes was easy. However, we were accompanied by two children who were not very adventurous & we ended up ordering 4 trays of dumplings to accommodate everyone. Everyone killed it. Regarding the seating process, you get a ticket & wait for your # to be called. The numbers are not called in order. I was told 15 minutes, but waited a little over an hour. We had a big party & they were really busy. At some point you've waited so long you just decide to succumb to the wait. In the end it was worth it. Nice pot of hot tea to warm us & we left with full belly's! As mentioned it's cash only, but it's cheap!",1
"Joe's Shanghai was probably the only place I liked in NYC. Their soup dumplings were excellent. I recommend their eggplant with garlic l, braised duck, general tsos chicken and the sautéed clams.",1
"Great soup dumplings but service was not. They kept rushing us and would pick up our food when we had one dumpling left on the plate and transferred it over to another plate so we could hurry up and finish after being there for all of 10 minutes.

I understand that business is about making money and there were a lot of people outside but after waiting an hour in line and then to get my food, I would have liked just  LIIIIITTLE bit more time to enjoy my food. It's a very small place and it's hard to walk anywhere without bumping into anyone. 

This place would have gotten a 1 star from me for the customer service but I would hate to deter anyone away from trying their exquisite Xiao Long Bao.",1
"Beautiful and delicious soup dumplings! So delicious! They spill onto your shirt, but it is worth it. I am going to go back.",1
"This is ranked the top location in NYC for XLB so I had to come try it. I came with my boyfriend earlier in the day before lunch time and we were seated immediately. We really just wanted to try the XLB and nothing else. We ordered just one order of the XLB and I appreciated that the waiter did not judge us lol. Fast service, quick and easy! They also offer take out too. Most people come for the XLB but I did see that other dishes looked good. Price was reasonable, but was it the best XLB I've ever had ? No. It was good, but just not the best. Love the quality and freshness though!",1
"It's pretty good, kinda expensive for what it is but the dumplings were good. Honestly though, there's a million places like it and they all have shorter lines",1
"Probably my favorite chinese restaurant of all time. First of all, this place is going to be packed when you get there, expect a wait. Let me tell you though, the wait is well worth it. My friends and I went there at 1pm on a Sunday and waited 20 minutes. Secondly, the seating is family style, large community tables of 10-12. If you're not a fan of sitting next to a person you don't know, this may not be the place for you. I, however, could care less who is sitting next to me, as long as this place keeps up the quality of their food, and ridiculously low prices. I came in here with 5 others, and we were all pleasantly surprised that our waiter knew perfect english (not trying to be racist or stereotypical). It is a general assumption from the wait staff that you are there for the soup dumplings, and that is the first thing they ask you when you are seated, everything else is kind of extras. Out group got the soup dumplings, General Tso's chicken, Seasame Chicken, Beef Noodles (OUTSTANDING), fried dumplings (in my opinion better than their steamed counterparts), and fried rice. Fair warning, order one order of soup dumplings at a time. After about 10-15 minutes, they get cold, and the quality of the product drops significantly. Also, for 6 people, the amount of food we ordered way WAYYYY too much. I think our final bill ended up coming out to $100 (gratuity included), and I would say we took home 1/4 of the food we ordered.",1
"I've been here twice this past month and more times than I can recall in the past. 

The first time I went with folks that work at Rocketboom. Here's what they said:

""This is the only place in China town where I can eat Chinese food and won't get sick from it afterwards.""

The 2nd time I went with Jeff C.'s group on a dumpling run. Here's what they have to say about it:

""I'm glad this place have Tsing Tao (beer).""",1
If you're ever in china town NY you mist stop by Joes for some soup dumplings. Try to get there when the restaurant opens to avoid the wait. Its small but most places in NY are and the turn around time is quick. Sometimes you might be sitting with another party at your table. My favorite is the crab dumplings but the pork is good too. Both are packed with flavor. It might take you a few times to master not spilling all the broth on your plate.,1
"The daughter INSISTED I go here while in NYC and I'm glad I did.  Would've been much better to go with someone else, but going by myself is better than not going at all.  Since it was just me, they seated me at a communal table.  There was a group of 3 friends, and another 2 oriental women.  I ordered the soup dumplings, which were SO VERY GOOD!  I struck up a conversation with the 3 friends, hoping that they'd offer to let me try some of their food.  It was VERY obvious that they'd ordered WAAAAY too much.  But when they didn't offer, I thought they'd be taking the leftovers home with them...  But they didn't!  It was sooooo sad to watch all that food go to waste, and I hadn't had a chance to try any of it!  The oriental women did offer, and I tried a soup that they had which was better than I'd expected it to be.  The building itself is kind of a dump, but the food was outrageously good.  And NOT extremely expensive, like most things in NYC!",1
"My annual trip to China for work doesn't look like it happening this year, and because of that this summer has been the summer of Chinese food (and lots of running because of it). 

The latest installment Shanghai Soup Dumplings. I have flown out of Shanghai twice but never had the chance to try a famous soup dumpling so Joe's Shanghai in China town would have to suffice. 

First off there is the technique, you pick up the top of dumpling carefully with your chop sticks and place it in the soup spoon, then once safely on your plate you gently puncture the top of the dumpling to let the soup cool, at this point you can suck a little soup out if you so desire, then once the dumpling is cool enough you attempt the eat the whole thing.
Biting into this wonderful morsel is new experince in itself, first soft sticky dumpling skin, then the rush of the soup and finally the meaty center. It is like a party in your mouth.

We had other food as well but the soup dumpling was the star!",1
"Forget the soup dumplings and get the Shanghai Chives & Shrimp with Meat Wonton in Broth. Don't get me wrong, soup dumplings were good, but we thought the wontons were so much better. Even the server said wontons have better flavor.",1
"We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings. They were hands down the best I've tried! Add the chili oil and vinegar sauce, so flavorful!",1
My favorite place for soup dumplings. They are so good! Also recently renovated and the indoor dining is very nice. Quick service and friendly staff. Take out always on point. Their hot and sour soup is so good.,1
"Came here for the soup dumplings, of course! Also got an order of the fried rice cakes. I think it's a little pricey for chinatown, there's always a wait for a table, and I don's think it smells that great. That being said the soup dumplings are huge and delicious and what more could you want on a cold day?",1
"The BEST xiao long bao ever!! Steaming hot, juicy, soupy dumplings!! The original was great but the crab XLB was even better!! Too many good stuff going on in my mouth for one bite!....So good!!",1
"Came for the soup noodles and was not disappointed.  I will say, I did not like the ones with the crab, they tasted fishy to me.  Next time, I would only order the ones with pork only.  My husband agreed with me.  We also ordered the Singapore Chow Mei Fun and loved it.  I have not been to the two other locations, but I loved traveling down to Pell St location, it feels like going to a secret hideaway.",1
"Out of this world amazing soup dumplings. One of the best meals I've ever had. My friend and I showed up about an hour early because we were told the wait can get crazy but we were still the only ones by the time they were open. We got an order of soup dumplings and an order of on fried dumplings. The soup dumplings were big and sooo juicy. The soup inside was so damn flavorful, it was like WOW xlb's can taste this good?! They were really big so equal parts fantastic and tricky. I feel like with soup dumplings you have to get them in one bite to do it right so that's quite the big bite. Pan fried pork dumplings were really tasty too but pales in comparison to the xlb. Staff were friendly enough but you don't go to Chinese restaurants for the service!",1
"First time yesterday for dinner, it's a great place. Everything we ordered was super, garlic eggplant, Shanghai shrimp and of course the steamed  crab dumplings. Highly recommend this place. Service was equal, very nice place.",1
"I dream about these soup dumplings. Fantastic food, but be prepared to wait since they do not take reservations here. Also, it is cash only! We were seated at a communal table with one other group of five, and it was fine. It does not take away from the experience. The food comes quickly, is hot, and delicious!",1
"The soup dumplings- amazing. Never had before, so I may be inexperienced to make that call, but I would go back and wait in that crazy line again just for them! Dumplings, rice/lo mein, and an entree dish would be enough for 3-4 average eaters- and all for about $10pp including tip!!! Great value. Plus, unlimited jasmine tea (a fave). 

Be prepared for a long wait, long bathroom lines, subpar service, and sitting with a table of strangers. But like I said- that price!",1
"The only thing worth getting is the pork and crab ""steamed bun"" which is, of course, soup dumplings.

There's a line to be seated even late at night which is probably due, in part, to the fact that so many other places in Chinatown close 10pm or earlier (despite posted hours to the contrary - I'm looking at you Shanghai Asian Manor).",1
"I've been eating Chinese food all my life.  So much so, that I got very tired of it.  And because its availability is high, the quality seems to go down and I rarely enjoy it.  Joe's is a different story.  This food is exceptional.   It was so delicious it was hard to put down.  I had the Green Beans and Beef and an order of Egg Fried Rice.  Amazingly exceptional.  I don't know how I will ever eat and enjoy Chinese food elsewhere.  Additionally, the community table sitting/eating was fun and we enjoyed great conversations.",1
"Obviously, can't compare with Asia and with that being said, this is some of the best pork Xiao Long Bao I've had in the States. Onion Pancake and Shanghai style stir fry noodles were good as well.",1
"This review starts what I believe will be 5-10 days of reviews of lunch spots near the courts on Centre St.    Yes, that means I am a juror (#5), so with my 1.5 hrs I figured I would do some good.

I usually go to the Joe's Shanghai in Flushing, and rarely go to this one and the one on 56th Street.  I have had soup dumplings all over NYC and Shanghai, and these are officially the best.  They trump the other Shanghainese places in Flushing (others have skin too thick or broth too lean).  My lunch here at the Pell St location consisted of a simple tray of 8 pork and crab soup dumplings.  And while the taste was spot on, a few were stuck together and some others were stuck to the bottom.  Both issues resulted in a loss of the precious juice; a major problem.  Hence, the knocking of a star.  I also like the beef with rice cakes, which I did not get this time but would recommend. For the best ambiance and cheapest prices, I would suggest this location and the Flushing location.

UPDATE: I was dismissed from jury duty because the case was settled.  No more fun Chinatown lunch adventures.",1
"If you don't already know about Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings, crawl out of your cave and go get some. And please bring me a dozen.

The only thing i have to add is that, lately for me, an order of soup dumplings is not complete without the PEA SHOOTS. Sometimes they're not on the menu and I think they cost as much as an order of soup dumplings, but totally worth it.  YUM.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is one of the most popular Xiao Long Bao (XLB- soup dumplings) spots in Chinatown and for good reason. They moved from their original location a few years ago where you had to share a circular table with other diners ( which added to the dining experience in China town) but they maintain the same great food. The XLB are large and filled to the brim with soup in addition to being well priced. It is a must try when visiting! Outside of the XLB, Joe's also serves other classic Chinese dishes but the star has to be the XLB. Joe's is a cash only establishment and there is usually a 20-30 min wait for a table. They do also automatically add an 18% gratuity on top of your bill regardless or how much you order or if your party size. Overall, Joe's Shanghai is definitely worth the stop for  their XLB, but make sure to bring cash!",1
"Yummyyy soup dumplings and reasonable price!! I would def. come back here :) The only downfall is that they seat you with a bunch of strangers so it's kind of awkward hahah. Besides that, the food is pretty satisfying.",1
"We heard about this place from chef Robyn from the rumor's bar kitchen ""palate party"" in Wilton manors, FL. check them out!!! 

Upon walking to the place located in a Chinatown-esk neighborhood, in an alley. There was a huge line outside the door. Walk inside give the hostess the number in your party and she gives you a number. Eventually the same hostess will come and call random numbers to come in. It's family style seating so be prepared to make friends at a shared table if necessary. Small place, seats about 25 people. 

They are known for their soup dumplings so that is all we were there to try before our flight. You can choose from crab or pork meat with crab. These dumplings were the best I have ever ever had. Huge portion, 6 for $9. We got the mix of pork and crab. Full of delicious broth with so much filling. Steamy and heaven! 10hrs later on a flight back home to Fort Lauderdale, and I was still talking about them. 

The people we got sat with ordered other food, that also looked and smelled delicious!",1
"For sure an adventure, not the best Chinese food I have ever had but very interesting. First off cash only so make sure you know that. Second it a scrum to get into this place so for sure plan to get there 30 minutes or more before you plan to eat and don't be surprised as you get seated for 10 strangers at a big family style table.  We were at a table for 10 with just the two of us. We had the soup dumplings of course and they were for sure the highlight. If I would were to go back I would have gotten two orders of those and perhaps just one dish more (for two people).  They are worthwhile as others point out, be very careful when eating as the soup is inside. 

We had a sesame chicken dish that was very good and a broc beef that wasn't amazing but servicable.  This is an experience and due to buddy who lives in the city I found it.

As point out cash only and the put the 15% tip for you, frankly the service sucks so they probably were getting less so added in.",1
"I think I was supposed to like this place more than I did or maybe soup dumplings just are not my thing. CASH ONLY establishment. Friendly takeout and it takes 15 minutes to get the dumplings to go. 

Soup dumplings are 8.95 for a nice portion.",1
"Best damn soup dumplings EVER. I was in absolute heaven here w/ these little juicy purses of deliciousness. 

Joe's Shanghai is apparently really well-known for these little puppies, but the noodles that my friend ordered are supposed to be a real hit too. The noodles were as good as she had promised, but I'm sad to report that I can't recall the name of em'. 

We ordered the dumplings and the noodles + a bowl of rice and were stuffed by the end of the meal. They are more than plenty for 2 people.

Thanks to my bff for bringing me to this Chinatown gem! What a treat!!",1
"It's been my must and first stop restaurant when I come in town.

Always, always, always! order xiao long bao or as I call it, explode in your mouth of deliciousness. I've also ordered the shrimp shumai soup. Delish!

They open at 11 a.m. and make sure you get there early enough cause it will get busy. If it gets busy, they will start seating people (if 2 or less) in a big round table with other strangers. I wouldn't mind that cause I'll be making friends anyways.

Service is just like any where in Chinatown, hard to explain and hard to understand. But it's hard for them to mess up your order.


Cash only and please don't be that guy who will give up your watch as collateral and run to the ATM.",1
"First time eating ""soup dumplings"" was at Joe's.  It's a great place to get an introduction.  Their scallion pancakes were cooked to a scrumptious crispiness.",1
"YOU MAY BE FREEZING OR SWEATING OUTSIDE BUT KEEP WAITING- IT'S WORTH THE WAIT.  Go inside and get a number and the lady will call you. There's no reservations and they will not call your phone. Do not walk away because when the lady calls your number and you do not answer she will give your seat away. 

It's aways crowded in here but the dumplings comes quickly- like 10 minutes fast if you order right away. 

This is a solid place for good Shanghai food. You get everyone from all walks of life to eat here from the locals, business men from Wall Street, college students, to tourists. Yes there is a long wait- usually about 20-40 minutes but the food is very good. The services is okay. This place is always packed. There was a time where it was easy to find a seat but that was over 10 years ago.

Xiao long bao- soup dumplings are the best here. It's always hot and it has cabbage underneath it which taste very good with the vinegar dip the dumplings comes with. The soup is to die for. No funky smell or taste- just really good dumplings.

pan fried dumplings also known as potstickers- they make these deeped fried and it comes with a sweet sauce. I like it, 

Shanghai thick noodles- dont get this. it's a greasy mess. They are thick udon type of noodles with soy sauce and preserved vegetables. I do not like this at all. 

Shanghai fried rice- Very good. Some of the best I had. Remember this is the Shanghai fried rice NOT the pork fried rice or the yeung chow!! This is nice, chewy rice texture and eggs with scallions and brocolli stems in tiny pieces. Here's a pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?select=ze5EjzJBcJfKTLOWpEmfag#liWom4GCKRqUWqPyyMzjjg",1
"A fixture of China Town, this place simply makes the best Chinese food I've ever had. I don't know if it's authentic, and the dining room is cramped and certainly doesn't have much aesthetic quality, but you're not going to care because the soup dumplings are absurdly great. Everything else on the menu is excellent too, and the food lacks that overly syrupy/MSG overdose tendency that much of ""Americanized"" Chinese food has - meaning that despite the generous portions, you don't end up in a food coma afterwards. Put simply, the place is great.",1
"Still my favorite Soup Dumpling spot in Manhattan! I hadn't been in almost a year, and the dumplings were just as flavorful. We waited for about 15 minutes on the Monday of labor Day weekend, and it was well worth it. Also, remember, it's BYOB!

Also enjoyed the kung Pao and the Sauteed String Beans with pork. 4 stars instead of 5 because of crowding and the effect on table service which was brusque at best, and bothered at worst. We ordered two orders of soup dumplings, and didn't get our second until well after we had our entrees. The price of popularity!",1
"We only ordered soup dumplings. ONLY soup dumplings. Plus fried scallion pan cake. 

The soup dumplings here is good. I like the crab meat soup dumplings better than regular pork soup dumplings. The crab has more flavor and tastes much better. The regular pork soup dumplings tastes too oily. 

Overall, this is a good place to go.",1
"Tucked away in a random Chinatown alley, Joe's Shanghai is a hidden oasis of amazing flavors. Ok, maybe not that hidden, considering the place was freaking packed and people (including us) waited at least a half hour outside in 20 degree weather.. or maybe that's just how popular it is.. 

The famous soup dumplings (Xiao long bao) from Joe's are pure awesomeness!  They are made to perfection and don't break and spill like at other places.. So good.. we killed like three or four orders of them!!  Oh yeah, we also got some pan fried noodles and a shrimp soup.. pretty tasty, too.  

It's was worth the long walk deep into Chinatown, dipping and dodging the Gucci and Prada peddlers along the way.  And it was definitely worth the wait just for those little flavor packed Chinese dumplings.  Joe's is a MUST hit for any NY trip.",1
"SO cheap, and SO good. I just don't like sitting in a table with people I don't know. But the restaurant has no choice because the line to eat is so long (I don't like waiting either, super impatient especially waiting to eat). So in a table for 10 people, they would fit 3 couples there, or 2 families there. I still think it's the best 小籠包 place in Chinatown.",1
"Visited Joe's Shanghai last Friday. Waited about an hour to be seated. This was partly due to how crowded it was, and partly because they won't seat you unless your entire group is there. We ended up having 9 people instead of 8, and one of the employees kinda flipped out a little over that.

Very crowded and noisy inside, which is typical of dim sum places. Reminded me of dim sum back in Hong Kong. My husband and I are vegetarian, and there were plenty of dishes for us. Loved the scallion pancakes! I was sad to have to pass on the soup dumplings. They looked amazing! 

Our bill came to $132, including tax and tip. We had ordered a ton of food, and I was surprised by what a good deal it was per person. 

The website says no reservations, but they will take reservations if you have a party of 10 or more.",1
"After hearing my family rave about this place I finally got to try it. It's a hole in the wall kind of place. This place is starting to gain traction because there's a lot of celebrities eating here. I want to say that their soup dumplings are the reason why they are coming but I looked at some peoples table and there's no soup dumplings. Do remember if you're coming here it's cash only. 

I came for the soup dumplings. I'd only order soup dumplings here and maybe every now and then chive pancakes. 

They serve two types of soup dumpling. The classic pork soup dumpling and a crab soup dumpling. I like the crab soup dumpling a lot more than the pork. The crab soup dumplings has the classic pork with some crab and fatty part of the crab. I totally recommend this place for that.",1
"BEST ASIAN RESTAURANT I'VE PROBABLY EVER BEEN TO! I'm a huge critic when it comes to food and I can honestly tell you that Joe's Shanghai is amazing! The wait was a bit long and kept getting longer, but that's okay given how great the meal was. The standout dishes for me were the pork soup dumplings and the sesame chicken. Both the crab and pork soup dumplings were good, very different, but still good. The better one was for sure the pork dumplings, however. The broth was rich and flavorful as was the meat. They were a favorite amongst the whole family. Now, I'm afraid to have soup dumplings from anywhere else because I doubt any other restaurant can top my experience at Joe's Shanghai. I'm hoping to be able to get my hands on some frozen ones if they ship to other states. The soup dumplings were life-changing and I would recommend them 100 times over!! Thank you Joe's Shanghai!!!",1
Shanghai dumplings were great. This place gets packed from what I read but it wasn't bad at all mid afternoon.,1
"This place is definitely the place for soup dumplings! HENCE MY PICTURE =) Always crowded but so worth it.  Even though I feel awkward sitting at the table with many other people. (its a small restaurant so you share your big round table with other people if you go wtih a few people)  But the feeling definitely goes away knowing your going to have some yummy dumplings.  we would buy basket after basket.  
everything else there is okay but i really wouldn't go there to buy other entrees.  Just fill yourself up with the soup dumplings because they are so worth it.

I also think this shanghai in chinatown is the best.  we went to the one closer to time square and it was more expensive and the taste was actually different and it seemed like there was less soup in the dumpling.",1
"Things to note:

The wait sucks.

Tsingtao beer goes with anything on the menu

The two teenage girls that work the door always screw up the numbers and I end up waiting longer.

Loads of tourist.

Loads of Chinese Families, so you know it's the real deal.

You sit with a bunch of people you don't know. So if you get the fat smelly dude as a dining partner, sorry brother.

Pretty much everything on the menu is good.

Soup Dumpling! Get them or don't even bother going.",1
"After a failed attempt to get a late Sunday brunch at Locanda Verde (subway closures, taxi snubs, and no seating after 3), we made our way to Joe's Shanghai for a very late lunch.  I'd had the place on my list since 2009 but never found a convenient time to go.  Apparently the restaurant is packed with a line out the door at all times - there was a half hour wait at four in the afternoon.  Impressive.

We took a number and grabbed boba next door, and with our hunger temporarily addressed, the wait wasn't terrible.  When a large party cleared out, a man called our number.  We were a party of three, and we got seated at a communal table with a few other small groups.  The setting was pretty dingy and uncomfortable, with, incredibly, the locker room stench of worn feet.  To my relief, that faded behind the smell of Chinese food when we sat down.

Service was curt and kind of funny.  ""What dumpling you like?"" was the standard greeting.  Our waiter spoke very little English and offered zero help with the menu when we asked what else was good.  Not rude, just brutally cursory.

We got an order each of pork and crab soup dumplings, and they were quite good.  They came eight to an order, so two orders were more than enough for three.  The dumplings were big and somewhat hard to eat.  I haven't worked out how to eat xiaolongbao without either losing all the soup or burning my mouth, so I did plenty of both.  Maybe someone will tell me the secret for my birthday one year.  Scalding aside, these were good dumplings.  The skins varied in thickness, but they were good where thick and good where thin, always supple, never too doughy, and sometimes pleasantly sticky. The insides were great, too.  I have to admit I couldn't really distinguish between the pork and crab (I suspect that the crab dumplings are mostly pork, or that our waiter mistook our order), but both sets of dumplings featured succulent mounds of meat enveloped in a wealth of hot, flavorful, fatty meat juice.

The dumplings were the main event, but we added a couple other dishes to round out our meal.  We chose them mostly at random from that vast, meagerly descriptive menu, and they were decent.  I actually quite liked the double cooked pork, which came in a stir fry with a mix of vegetables and mushrooms.  The meat was tender and very flavorful, with a hint of spice.  I was less keen on the Shanghai pan fried noodles, which came in a heap with some beef and greens.  They had a bouncy texture that was good enough, but the soy sauce flavoring was pretty one-dimensional.

I don't know that I'd brave the wait to try Joe's Shanghai again (I mean I haven't even been to Din Tai Fung, which is the main XLB purveyor back in L.A.), but it was worth it the one time.  You must love dumplings to enter, enough to put up with a long wait and a rather unlovable setting. If you do, though, give the place a go.  Let me know if you make it out without burning the inside of your mouth.",1
"I heard about all the hype with Joe's Shanghai and my friend actually told me his last meal on Earth would be their chili prawns so I meannnnnn I had to see what the hype was all about.

We came here around 6 and waited 30 min for a table which I felt wasn't that long since we came during peak dinner time. They had a temperature check at the front and a place to sign-in with your phone number (I'm assuming to give customers a call if there were any covid issues?) and we got seated at a table that an employee had just sanitized. 

We ordered the crab meat and pork soup dumplings, chili prawns with shell off, sauteed flat thick noodle with beef and sauteed string beans with minced pork. Ok, first of all, the XLB is filled to the absolute brim with delicious soup. I have never encountered a XLB with that much soup inside. The filling was full of flavor and you can taste the crab and pork really well. The other menu items were all equally delicious and I can see why my friend loves the chili prawns so much. The prawns are super plump and the sauce has the perfect balance of sweet & sour and loaded with large pieces of garlic.

Wow, honestly 10/10 solid meal! We even considered coming here a second time but decided against it to try other foods, but I'll definitely be coming back on my next NY trip.",1
Best soup dumpling I've ever had!! Singapore noodles too spicy but whatever were good. Everything was delicious!!,1
"The past couple of times I've been to NYC I have tried getting into Joe's Shanghai. There was always a line out the door, and at least an hour-long wait. So when we happened to be in Chinatown on a Monday afternoon, imagine my delight! Famous for the ""soup dumpling,"" Joe's Shanghai is a bit of a New York establishment...

I should have done my research ahead of time. Instead we went in without a clue (like most tourists.) We were seated at a round communal table, and given chopsticks and some green tea. The menu was somewhat baffling. Although the restaurant is known for the ""soup dumplings"" these items were not prominently featured on the menu. I flipped through for a while before asking the waiter for help. I was given a cross 'you-look-Chinese-but-can't-speak-the-language?' stare and after much confusion, the waiter made my order for me.

The Xiao Long Bao or, ""little dumplings basket,"" arrived fresh in a bamboo steamer. They were round, symmetrical things, that supposedly resemble a pagoda shape. Observing my neighbors, I decided the best way to eat them was to plop a dumpling on my spoon, nibble off the top, drizzle in some of the vinegary sauce, and then suck the meaty broth from the steaming pouch. Afterwards I could munch away at the delicious little crab and pork meatball and the yummy doughy wrapper.

Other specialty dishes at Joe's Shanghai include, the shredded turnip shortcake, a variety of seafood options, braised duck and Shanghai fried bean curd (this one was delicious!)

Please note: Dine carefully on the ""soup dumplings"" as these little pouches of steaming hot liquid can result in severe tongue burning!",1
"The most amazing traditional Chinese food I've ever had! Service was quick, and it was definitely worth the trip to China town.",1
Absolutely amazing! Been to NYC 3 times and to Joe's Shanghai a total of 5 times! The dumplings are a must! The general chicken is amazing and the pieces of meat do not disappoint!,1
YUM dumplings + fried rice off da chain! Worth making across town for.  I know good food bring a foodie from LA.,1
"Shanghai Cafe Deluxe is my go to spot whenever I'm in NYC but this time I was with some friends who wanted to try Joe's Shanghai so I bit my foodie tongue to go with the flow. I've always wanted to compare Joe's to Cafe Deluxe since so many people rave about Joe's. 

Overall, I still prefer Shanghai Cafe Deluxe since their soup dumplings are better. 

1. The dumplings were like a young teenage boy where the skin is so thin the dumplings were prematurely bursting with the graze of a chopstick.

2. The soup dumplings at Joe's are bigger but too big for the spoon where the dumpling skin flows over the spoon which makes it harder to eat. 

The flavor of the broth was good though with the Crab being my favorite. We also ordered the fried rice cakes and I liked Shanghai Cafe's better. These were pretty greasy. But the other items we ordered were actually really good.

Service was satisfactory and it was great to finally try out Joe's but my heart lies with another.",1
"May take a bit to get seated but great dumplings, sesame chicken, scallion pancakes and more",1
"best soup dumplings in nyc, sesame chicken good also",1
"Soup dumplings are the best in town. Family style dining makes this a normal occurrence as a solo diner. If there's a wait, grab a drink around the corner at the speakeasy apothke.",1
"I was kinda conflicted when trying to rate Joe's Shanghai.  If I could, I'd give it 4.5 stars...5 for the soup dumplings, but .5 deduction for bad service.  Normally, I'm not one to deduct for non-food related stuff (especially cuz what's the point of food...it's to eat it), but the combination of all the bad service-related issues plus the other so-so dishes on the menu, I ended up giving it 4 stars.

Let me start with the soup dumplings.  I'm from LA, so I've tried Din Tai Fung (the west coast contender for best XLB), but in my opinion, Joe's has, hands down, the BEST soup dumplings ever.  Every time I visit NY, I HAVE to have at least one meal at Joe's...even if it means waiting an hour to get one order of soup dumplings to eat as a appetizer before heading over to another restaurant for an entree and dessert.  The skin is perfectly thin and chewy, while the soup inside is so savory, you can't get enough of the soupy deliciousness.

For those who had tried other XLB places, here is how I think they compare.  Din Tai Fung - Joe's soup dumplings are way bigger, plumper, tastier, and cheaper.  Winner in all categories (except for atmosphere...DTF is way cleaner and presentable as a restaurant).  Shanghai Cafe - The skin is way too thick and doughy for my taste, but the inside does taste cleaner (not as greasy).  

Finally, let me touch upon why I ultimately gave Joe's Shanghai 4 stars instead of 5. On Yelp, their business hours are listed as being open everyday until 11pm, so imagine our surprise when we got there at 9pm, and they practically shooed us out of there saying that they were closed (the place was about 3/4 full with people still eating).  How rude!   And just a heads up - when you're paying, the bill they give you already includes a 15% tip (regardless of the size of your party).",1
"Best XLB that I have ever tasted in my life! Not that I have tasted that many....but still...it's the best! I went to the Midtown/Manhattan location a couple of weeks ago during a bachelorette party weekend. The crab/pork dumplings were rich, flavorful, and addicting. I really did not understand why people liked xiao long bao's until I tried Joe's Shanghai. I wish they would open up a location in the bay area.",1
"First rule: be prepared to be seated with strangers.
Second rule: rude hostess is to be expected.
Third rule: order the soup dumplings.

This is a traditional family style restaurant, where strangers are grouped together into a table, filling every chair - elbow to elbow. If you're shy, bring lots of friends. The soup dumpling are amazing. I like the traditional pork soup dumplings, and sometimes have the pork/crab soup dumplings as well. 

There is a secret to eating them:
1) place a single soup dumpling on your spoon
2) bit off the tip of the soup dumpling and let the steam out
3) pour a dab of the vinegar sauce into the opening
4) slurp the soup through the top, leaving some
5) then stuff the whole soup dumpling in your mouth

Your plate is guaranteed to be clean and all the yummy soup will be in your tummy and not on your plate.

And to the ""non Asian"" family I saw over the holidays, who were cutting their soup dumplings in half on their plates, leaving the soup - seriously, what part of the ""soup dumpling"" did you not understand?!?! It was heartbreaking to watch you guys eat.",1
"Two words. Soup Dumplings. Best I have ever had. Pan fried noodles are also really good and crispy if I have enough room for them after the dumplings. The place has been packed every time I have been in, its family style seating so there have been times when I have gone in by myself and got sat at a table with 8 other people I dont know, but I think that just adds to the atmosphere.",1
"Most of the time, unless you go during off hours, you wait forever for a table, get seated next to slobbering strangers, then get rushed out the moment you're done with your last bite. But being treated like such crap has never felt so worth it because those soup dumplings are soooooo good. I've definitely eaten fourteen or fifteen in one sitting, which is kind of gross (but it felt so right at the time!). If you've never tried them yet, just get up and go now. They're like heaven in a bamboo steamer.",1
"This place never disappoints! It has effectively ruined all Chinese food from hence forth. We order crispy beef and fried rice. Our kids love the pork dumplings, which is huge since they won't try anything new.",1
Great food. Great prices too. Dumplings and buns are phenomenal. The tofu dishes were delicious. Many locations. I personally have gone to 3. And they were all wonderful.,1
I love Joe Shanghai its the best. The soup dumplings is to die for. The general tso shrimp is so crispy but yet so sweet. General tso chicken is also great.,1
"Their food and pork dumplings are okay, but the crab and pork dumpling (xiao long bao) is amazing. I haven't been able to find another good crab flavored xiao long bao.",1
"My friend was raving about their pork soup dumplings, so we came by for those. They were absolutely fantastic! By far, the best soup dumplings I have had so far. $7 gets you 8 hot, delicious soup dumplings. You'll be craving soup dumplings the next day, and the day after that. 

Joe's Shanghai starts to get busy even when they have just opened for the day. Seating here is efficient, they fill their tables by pairing you with other groups, which is a pretty neat concept. 

I'll be returning soon for those soup dumplings!!",1
"There was a line at 2pm, but we decided to wait anyways because it took us forever to find the place and we've read so many good reviews. The hostess is rude, she threw our menu on the table, but I can understand because the place is packed with lines out the door. We ordered the Crab Meat with Pork Meat Steamed Bun (really juicy and tasty), Sliced Braised Beef Noodle Soup (a good warm soup with fresh noodles), and Shanghai Fried Flat Noodle (my ultimate go-to item). I really enjoyed the food, but don't expect a great atmosphere. They were watching our every bite to see when we would be done to get us out. Again, I can understand, it's just really crowded! Also, they don't use a lot of MSG as other Chinese restaurants, which was a big plus for me, and the food tasted very fresh.",1
"Joe's Shanghai is well known in Chinatown amongst both tourists and locals. Although I wouldn't say it is the best place to get soup dumplings or other Shanghainese dishes, it is a sort of right of passage in New York Chinese cuisine. 

Expect a wait, especially on weekends and for large parties as Joes does not take reservations. There's always a wait outside spilling into the street(we had a 30-45 wait for a party of 2 on a Saturday evening) and inside the restaurant is bustling and filled to capacity. Unless you are with a large group, you will likely be seated at a table with other diners. Although some might find the restaurant's tight space and shared tables uncomfortable, I enjoyed the energy, seeing what others were ordering, and chatting with other diners. 

If you're a tourist visiting Joe's, pay attention!! For the best experience, order items for your party to share. Guests are served tea with their meal so drinks are not required. Joe's is especially well known for their Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and I would say it's a must. Both the pork and crab soup dumplings are good, but I love the crab soup dumplings. DO NOT waste your visit by ordering the typical American Chinese dishes you're used to ordering at your local Chinese takeout spot (General tso's, Kung pao chicken,Sesame Chicken etc. Two other parties at my table did this and I was crying inside). Some tasty dishes that I recommend if you're new to Chinese food are Szechuan Beef Tendon Noodle Soup,  Shanghai Fried Rice, and Sautéed String Beans. From my experience the spice in dishes is toned down, even dishes marked as spicy are not too spicy. For those that want a bit more heat, there is also table chili oil (also pretty mild lol) to kick it up a bit. The meal is finished with complimentary orange slices, yum!

TL;DR expect a wait, order the soup dumplings, skip the American Chinese stuff you're used to, try something new.",1
"Have you even eaten in New York if you haven't eaten at a Joe's something??? It's classic. And Joe's Shanghai is no different. 

It's on the edge of Chinatown, walkable from the metro station. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and has a more modern vibe to it. 

My friend and I came in on a weekday afternoon (2pm) and it was still busy. We waited about 10 minutes for a table and the service was prompt and super speedy. 

We ordered the pork soup dumplings, the string beans with minced pork, fried rice cake with beef, and crispy pork chop. 

XLB: 9/10 this is my 3rd time coming here and I feel like the dumplings just keep getting bigger and bigger. The skin is on the thicker side and it's filled super full of soup and pork. They taste amazing, but minus one point bc I'm a thin wrapper girly

String beans: 10/10 perfectly cooked, not too mushy and not too crispy. Has that perfect crunch without being raw. Also perfectly flavored. Definitely a veggie dish though. The ""with minced pork"" means it has a small topping of pork. But super super yummy. Will always get this when I come here. 

Fried rice cake with beef: 9/10 chewy rice cakes with huge chunks of tender beef. Yummy, but not as flavorful as some of the other dishes. 

Crispy pork chop: 8/10 pork is tender and juicy and the fried outside is crispy. It's flavored really well and the sweet and sour sauce they serve with it adds the perfect extra flavor. I just wish the pork to batter ratio was a little better, batter can be a bit on the thicker side. 

Overall, amazing place with quality food. Definitely a classic. Add this to your list of ""Joe something's"" that you've been to",1
"Our number one place to go for soup dumplings. We don't usually order anything else so can't say much about the other dishes. The wait can be long at times but it's definitely worth it.

It's the perfect about of soup, pork, and skin per dumpling. We love to order the crab one. It's absolutely delicious and I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!",1
"My wife and I wanted to have a late lunch. I had read a review on this location and decided to stop. We were very lucky in that there was an open table for two at the front of the restaurant. Not knowing what is best, we ordered some gyoza and one order of soup dumplings. OMG we should have only gotten the soup dumplings!  The gyoza was ok but the dumplings...absolutely awesome. We ordered two more orders of these tasty gems. 
The richness of these juicy dumplings and the tasty morsels of filling were heavenly! When we go back it will only be dumplings.",1
My wife and I attended Joe's Shanghai on a Friday night and was greeted with a long line out the door.  After our long wait the soup dumplings were worth the wait.  In addition the sesame chicken was delicious.  Absolutely worth the trip!,1
Soup dumplings are so necessary! I've had a very limited selection here (we just came for the dumplings). Good prices and a TON of food. Service is pretty good. We enjoy coming here regularly.,1
"I have been to all 3 locations. My favorite one is the one located in Flushing. This one in Chinatown is not bad though. The wait is the worst part of it. At any given time you will wait half an hour to an hour. It's definitely worth it though! The other downside is they tend to sit you with random people, you can be sitting with like 2 other groups. It's kind of awkward at first, but most of the time, everyone is friendly. The wait staff is quick! Once you sit down, you can order your soup dumplings and they come out rather fast. I have to say the soup dumplings are the best thing on the menu --I always find a craving for them once the weather gets cold. The pork soup dumpling is the most popular, but the crab soup dumpling is my favorite. I also love their steamed buns with condensed milk as the dipping sauce!",1
"I actually like the dumplings here but not the pork-only ones.  There is nothing more to say about the dumplings that hasn't been said already.  However I think people are missing out if the only thing they order are the dumplings.  Their pure vegetables (not the junk with baby corns or their ilk) especially the snow pea leaves are so really good.  Also I suggest trying crispy chicken (only the skin is fried) or the pork shoulders.  Actually I haven't had anything bad except when I ordered typical Chinese American dishes like sesame chicken which came with a sauce that was way too heavy and sweet.

One bad thing is the wait.  I feel their whole wait list system is just plain broken which is why I like to come at slightly odd hours.  However the service is fine; you might need to raise your hand to get noticed but it isn't like they are ignoring you on purpose.",1
"Soup dumplings were amazing and waiter was helpful in instructing the proper way to eat them. 

Also ordered bubble tea and the chicken with mixed vegteables which was standard Chinese food. 

Pork soup dumplings were worth it though.",1
"My only exposure to soup dumplings has been at Din Tai Fung in California which I like perfectly fine and even crave sporadically. But I have friends who swear up and down that the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai will make my panties wet with joy so on our most recent trip out there, we stopped by Joe's Shanghai at my insistence, if only to sate my curiosity (the whole ""so delicious it'll make your panties wet"" thing was so not believable to me). 

Going to Joe's was seriously a random act so we actually ended up walking a few miles in the rain and ended up there at like 4 p.m. in the afternoon which I figured would be a good time to beat the crowds. I knew the place was popular but I mean, who would want soup dumplings at 4 p.m. on a hot and rainy summer day? A lot of people apparently as when we got there  the restaurant completely packed with a little bit of a wait.  

We had plans for dinner later on so we shared one order of the juicy pork soup dumplings between the two of us. To be honest, when I actually tasted them, I was sort of sad we were only sharing one order since by then I had to acknowledge they were pretty good and I could have eaten 2-3 orders all by myself. 

Was it that good? Yes it was good but who doesn't like soup dumplings? Was it better than Din Tai Fung? I couldn't say, the texture is different and each have their positive points. Would I go again? Sure, if I happened to be in NYC standing in front of the restaurant and there wasn't a line. Did it make my panties wet? Uhm no.

 Bottom line: I'm glad I tried it but with so many places in NYC to still get through, there probably won't be a repeat visit.",1
"Overpriced tourist trap
Mean hostess with a mean attitude and desperate need of manners. Watery dumplings, and barely ok everything else. Places hasn't been cleaned or re furnished since 1943",0
"This place is definitely paying for fake reviews. I get that it's always packed with tourists, but 2000+ reviews and 4 stars for unspectacular Shanghainese food?! You must be kidding me.",0
We got the soup dumplings and scallion pancake and it was just okay. Service was good. Weird that they charge a gratuity for all parties no matter the number of people. I wouldn't come back,0
"This place has gone downhill now that it is a tourist destination.  The dumplings are still good, but nothing else is.  Joe's Shanghai in Flushing is much better.",0
"I'm still searching for a decent soup dumpling restaurant in NYC. For me, this restaurant falls short on many levels. Immediately, upon entering, you'll be hit with a funky smell. The restaurant probably needs new carpet. Give it a few minutes and you'll get used to the smell. On to the food. All of our dishes were glistening in oil. I've come to expect this type of preparation at most chinese restaurants, but it was a little too much here. After waiting 30+ mins to get seated, you're ready to feast, so you get past the smell and oiliness quickly. Your stomach will be full after a meal here, but the quality and atmosphere could be improved. Also, don't forget this is a cash only restaurant!",0
Wanted to try the best soup dumplings in NYC but found the place a little overrated. I found the dumplings dry on the outside and soup not as flavorful as others I've had. It was nice to see all the famous pics of people on the wall who have eaten there.,0
"My friend recommanded this restaurant for me, but unfortuanately I had a verrrrrrry bad experience at there, probably this is the worst restaurant service I have ever had in New York. They refused to gave us seat only because one of our friend still on the way and didn't wait for the seat with us, we waited in January's cold wind for 30 minutes while there was a spare table all the time, and get a bunch of stink-eyes from waitress and boss because we argued. The food was OK , the price was cheap, but still very hard for me to take such a bad service. I'm a Chinese, I love Chinese food and always gave rather good rate for Chinese restaurant, but this one really irritated me. I can't believe our Chinese fellows can be such mean. There are tons of wonderful food in China Town, if possible, chose another one,  this is not the only choice.",0
"Listen, I love Joe's Shanghai, their thick noodles with pork and their soup dumplings are the fucking bomb. But I don't like the fact that their sesame chicken is 19$. It doesn't taste any different than your average NYC Chinese restaurant sesame chicken platters.",0
"For unknown reasons, this is probably the most popular spot in Chinatown. I'm kind of surprised but the food here is just alright at bed. I haven't been here too many times having been brought recently via a reservation and also with a group once. They specialize in XLB/xiao long bao and I would not order anything else but them. 

In terms of said soup dumplings, I have had better even in Manhattan Chinatown. As said by others, the skin is a bit too thick. The broth inside is fine. The meat is the best quality where the crab and pork is a lot better than the plain pork. It is a pretty good soup dumpling but there's better. I have (mistakenly) ordered the kao fu which I found it to be too cold so the texture was off not to mention the odd sizes of the wheat gluten compared to other spots. Another person got a noodle dish which was overpriced and just not that good. 

Perhaps the high reviews are coming from people who have never had Chinese food outside of American Chinese classics or something because I can't see why this place is popular enough to have a line out the door. Low/mid 2.",0
"As an Asian! I will say it just ok, pretty average! And place is a bit dirty. So I guess they know how to put money on Advertising. Maybe their food is more for the people who are not Asian",0
"I was visiting in NYC and decided to give this place a shot.  The xiao long bao weren't too bad and I am a bit biased since I prefer dumplings from the northern part of China.  With that being said I gave this place an extra star for their XLB, however everything else was pretty terrible.  

General Tso's chicken was more like orange chicken you can find at Panda Express and the Garlic Scallop and Shrimp had barely any flavor.  I forgave the fact that the place was not that clean and that we sat next to the trash as it is packed and super busy, but was so disappointed in the food.  Panda Express food for anything but Panda Express prices and I hate Panda Express.  The spring rolls should just be called  fried eggroll skins because their was literally nothing inside and the scallion pancakes were oily and soggy when they should be light on the oil, crispy on the outside, and layered goodness on the inside.  

I try to be gentle on Chinese dining since there are so many regions and specialties, but this place is a tourist trap.  I would agree with many of the reviews only order the XLB and if you are used to amazing XLB then just go somewhere else all together.  This place is not worth it at all.",0
I usually love the food here but today I was not as impressed. The pancakes and noodles were super greasy. The bao were really doughy and the dough was tough. I also found a piece of plastic in the noodles. I get they are busy but I think they should be a little more aware of what they are doing. Definitely questioning if I would go back.,0
"I have been looking to trying food in this restaurant based on the reviews and was deeply disappointed. 

The soup dumplings were officially the worst I have ever tried and I had tried a lot of them in various parts of the world including close to where they originated in Asia  

The corn and chicken soup had no taste and sesame chicken needed resuscitation with lots of sauce to at least have some flavor. 

Possiblity I'm not used to this taste and I apologise for this review as I assume huge number of people waiting in line who obviously like the taste but it is not for me.",0
"this place is just OK for me since I've had better Chinese food in Chinatown. it's such a tourist place and trust me, if you're tourist, please walk around Chinatown and experience other Chinese restaurants, they're way more authentic & tastier than Joe's Shanghai. tourist books may be helpful but sometimes, not ALL the restaurants that are recommended in the book are ""good"". 

cash only and authentic Chinese food don't have beef broccoli and General Tso's chicken and many more.",0
"My family and I got lucky and the line was not long when we arrived around 2:00 pm, there is usually a long line outside.    

The food was good - just good/decent, the overrated xia long bao are no way near as good as dim tai dings.  If you come here, just try the xia long bao and not the other entree dishes.  My family and I just arrived from miami, and we went straight to China town to get our late lunch at joe Shanghai following a friends recommendation. We were hungry after a long day journey but did not find the food as good as the other yelp reviews.  Get prepared for decent food.  

The service was impeccably rude, and most of the time felt like the waiters were trying to kick us out of the restaurant to admit others.  Even when we were done ordering and done eating, the waiters did not give us a good impression/service.

If I go back to New York City chinatown, I would try out other restaurants and definitely another place for xia long bao.",0
"Classic spot for soup dumplings and you can never go wrong here. However, the other dishes were somewhat lackluster. I was craving Americanized young chow friend rice as well and having been raised by Chinese restaurant owners, I was massively disappointed in their other dishes. The young chow fried rice had zero taste, so I imagine the chefs forgot to add flavor given customer traffic. I'd still return for soup dumplings, but may not be so willing to try their other menu items.",0
"We had a good time here although we aren't completely certain we'd come back. We enjoyed the food, but just weren't super impressed in the end. Felt underwhelmed. That being said, or group did have a fun time, just be prepared to be seated family style with other patrons at large tables!",0
"I was a bit of disappointed. I went there because of good review. The restaurant is so crowded. I ordered the famous crab dumpling; however, the dumpling filling has crab shell. Some dishes just put too much of soy source and oil. I was so embarrassed since I brought a guess there with me. If you had good Chinese food before, you won't consider to go there again.",0
"Havent been here for a few years but stop by yesterday. It was a disappointing at best.  the XLB or soup dumpling are still loaded with soup but they were obviously sitting in the steamer too long.  In each of the three order of XLB there were 1 or 2 that had burst.  

Wait staff was fine. The other dishes order (beef with green peppers) and rice cake with beef were greasy and average.  Quality has gone down and Joe's is jusy living off its previous reputaton. I have had better XLB in Flushing.

Whats even more insulting is that a 15% gratuity is automatically added to the bill.  Service was fine but the quality of the food wasnt.",0
"If you like to inhale your food, in a chaotic atmosphere, with abrupt and pushy ""hurry up and order"" waiters (when there were plenty of empty seats tonight, Super Bowl Sunday) then this place is for you.
If not, you're better off ordering takeout and sitting on the curb to really enjoy what I believe, are the finest scallion pancakes in New York City.
The soup dumplings were good too, nothing to rave about as so many do here, but overall, for the hype and quality of what was ordered by my party, I've gotten delivery uptown and found it just as good.
But again, the scallion pancakes are immaculate.
Note, count your change.  My friend (who treated) noticed his change was $5 short.  This from a man who has dined all over NYC for nearly 6 decades.
He told me, ""This has never happened before."" But because they already add in the tip to the total, felt the need to ask for his proper change.",0
"No.

Dirty looking.

They seated us in a round table with 3 other parties. Fat dumplings with fatty brought inside. It's supposed to be a light CLEAR broth. I'm not supposed to be seeing un purified broth. Sick. Tasty, but sick. Stomachache after.

Hot and sour soup was good, but we were too full from 2 sets of dumplings.",0
"Restaurant was awesome in terms of service and food, but shared tables has its downside sometime.. this person has been talking about me in front of me and possibly taking pic of me without consent, so I took a pic too just for the record",0
"Waited in line for an hour just to realize they forgot about us. When we approached the seating staff, she insisted that we didn't have our whole party with us when we actually did. No apologies either. Sat us down with some random strangers, waiter delivered food without telling us who it was for. When the food came, it was horribly mediocre. Screwed up service and run of the mill food. With the long queue to boot, this place hardly deserves half a star from me.",0
"This is probably the worst restaurant I had ever gone to in Chinatown NY. I ordered a dish, but obviously they did not have one of vegetables, so they just used others to replace it without telling us, pretending to offer the right dish. I knew he moment I saw. Shouldn't the restaurant at least tell the customer that they do not have something rather than pretend nothing happened? This is lack of credibility. And they only take cash. I asked if I can write a check, and they said 'no, who knows whether your account has money."" No respect to customers, at all.",0
"The customer service is horrific. The woman who calls out your number when they have a table ready was not calling my number even after 20 minutes when she said they'd be ready so I went to ask her. She said to wait 20 more minutes. I told her we've been waiting 20 minutes and she said ""You have no right to talk like that to me. Wait 20 more minutes!"" She calls our number a minute after that but seats us at a same table as some random strangers. The restaurant also automatically includes a 15% tip fee into your check. 

Terrible workers and overall rude and annoying experience. 

You can get soup dumplings at better serviced restaurants and probably won't have to wait as long for them as Joe's Shanghai. Fuck you Joe's Shanghai.",0
"The food was okay. Since the place was very crowded, they did not give us an option to share seat or not. 
We ordered soup dumpling and fried fish fillet. The soup dumpling was okay but nothing outstanding. The fish fillet for me was a bit too greasy.
Overall, it's just like any other dumpling place.",0
"Not bad at all, but I guarantee you'll find better on the Pacific side :)
The only things really worth ordering were the xiao long bao, all the other food was not even mediocre. The skin was a little thick for my liking but the broth was tasty. Be prepared to have a shared table.",0
To be fair their soup dumplings are unparalleled but the tourist lines ain't worth it. Joe's Ginger which is a few walks down  (90% sure they have similar owners). Skip the wait and go to the other place.,0
"We were seated at a rather small table to share with 4 others.  Its typical to share tables at chinese places but I've never been to a place that had so many ppl at such a small table.  I noticed that my spoon had dried food bits on it and asked the waiter for another.  When all our food came it was a challenge to maneuver.   

We got two orders of dumplings and crispy squid.  Dumplings were average.  I guess the squid is from some other region because it was very greasy and soggy.  Being korean we needed our hot oil so we asked the waiter for another jar since it wasnt easy to share the one jar with 4 other ppl.  He just took the jar from the other side of the table from the other diners and walked off.  At that point I just told myself service isnt a strong point in chinese restaurants and I let myself not be guilty for tipping low (or not at all) as is the custom.  

When the bill came I was shocked to see 15% tip was included.  When I asked the cashier she said it was included in all bills.   I guess they felt the need to capitalize on their tourist trap success and charge for what they call service.

So I've decided that there are definitely better places in the city for soup dumplings.  If you want cheap food, crap service, and a kick in the butt for mandatory tip then go here.",0
"The three of us stopped by for some xiao long bao around 6 PM on a Friday night and were told that the wait was 25 minutes.  There were a lot of many people waiting and complaining about when they were going to be seated. The place was so crammed, we ended up taking up a little corner on the stairs and waited for over an hour to be seated.  About one minute after we ordered, we got two orders of pork steamed soup buns which definitely had been left out for a while....they were hard and not very juicy. 
About thirty minutes later we got our crab meat with pork soup buns and these were delicious.  Maybe I'd go back for the crab meat with pork soup buns, but I don't know if I'd be up for waiting so long in a crammed area. How do you New Yorkers do it?",0
"The dumplings are what's ""hot"" here. Even the shrimp dumplings have pork in them, all of the dumplings have pork in them, it doesn't say it on the menu but ask and they will tell you. 

The shrimp I ordered wasn't anything to scream about, barely any seasoning on it, it wouldn't hurt them to have some bean curd options... On the upside I'm pretty romanced by the scallion pancakes. 

The waiters are pretty passive, the ""don't wanna be bothered"" demeanor is every where. 

Ooo yea, and plan for a 20 min - 1 hr. wait on weekends,",0
"New York's Chinatown has always been a treasure trove of exotic delights from sugar apples, rambutan, crocodile meat and ancient herbal cures. And yes, xiao long bao, or as we call it in English, soup dumplings. 

Literally translated, xiao long bao means 'little basket bun' and not considered a dumpling by the Chinese for it is pinched at the top as opposed to dumplings, which are pinched along the semicircle. Mistranslated as it is, it has made its way from Shanghai's province of Nanxiang into surrounding Asian nations and into the United States. They are made using partially raised flour that results in tender, almost translucent dough but one that won't break while cooking, and traditionally pleated 18 times. The broth inside is produced by wrapping the filling with a gelatin based aspic or by grounding it into the filling. As the buns steam the aspic melts and the result is that lip smacking deliciousness that is the xiao long bao. 

Joe's Shanghai opened its first store back in 1995 in Flushing, New York. Since then they've opened 2 other locations, one in Chinatown and another in Midtown. They also have 3 stores in Japan where xiao long bao has a cult following of sorts. A visit to Joe's during peak hours inevitably means a wait but turn over is fairly quick and a half hour wait is more than worth it for their xiao long bao. Since the serving portions are rather large it's best to go with a group of 4 or more. Try both the pork and crab xiao long bao. To consume them minus the painful hot broth burn place a bun on a spoon, gently nibble off a piece of the dough to let the steam out, season with the vinegar sauce, and savor the bun together with the broth.",0
"Bad service. They ask us to share table with others. Bad taste either. Left with dishes almost like it was served, and cost us $20/each. I lived in Shanghai for 7 years and I know the cuisine. The materials are low quality, and not well cooked as well. One of the worst Chinese restaurant.",0
"4 star for their soup dumplings- they were pretty fat and juicy! However the best part about a soup dumpling is the soup... They actually had the audacity to serve one that was clearly popped and dry. I was so annoyed because I had to suck it up and eat that one :'( other than that, the pork soup dumplings were delicious. Crab soup dumplings were alright- I still recommend you try one of these just so you can decide for yourself if you like it!

Other food- DONT DO IT... Unless you're not Asian or you're into like Americanized Chinese food. If you are bringing your Asian friends and family here, seriously don't bother with the food outside of soup dumplings. That last picture was apparently twice cooked pork... But for anyone who actually has eaten twice cooked pork, this is nothing like it!
The green beans were okay but they were supposed to come with more meat in it...
The beef dish was mostly veggies and like a small amount of beef... It should've been in the veggies section of the menu!
Everything tasted unauthentic which is really unfortunate because I expected better from an Asian restaurant in Chinatown.",0
"I'm a New Yorker. This is New York Chinese food, plain and simple. I don't get the thousands of fawning reviews. Tourists? Bots? People who've never had decent Chinese food? It's OK - I've had better. 

Tip: if there's a line out the door, as I've heard there can be, go to any place nearby. No difference.",0
"The food was excellent. I enjoyed how they grouped multiple parties at one table. It didn't feel awkward at all. It was really packed. And the service wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. It felt rushed. And a waiter spilled some hot tea on my friends leg. Again, the food was great. I would have preferred better service though.",0
"Everyone be sure to do not double tip! They have already charged you 18% service fee. 

The soup dumpling was 2/5, quite disappointing with its thick layer of skin. The fried rice was pretty good though.",0
"Bad service, missed our order, put wrong food. Everything is oily, I don't recommend any one who wants have decent dinner experience come to here. Besides soup dumplings, there are all American style Chinese food. If you are Chinese please save your money and find other dim sum places are way better than here.",0
"Maybe I just don't ""get it,"" but I thought all the food we got was just fine - not exceptional.  We got the soup dumplings (xiao long bao), scallion pancake, and bok choy w/bean curd.  The bok choy/bean curd dish came with a lot of thick sauce - just wasn't what I expected, but it was fine.  Xiao long bao were fine, I didn't think they were that exceptional.  The scallion pancake was crispy.

I guess it's good to try it once if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way again to eat here.",0
"XLB were good, but some were a bit dry at certain parts. Turnip cake was very tasty, as was the roast beef noodle soup. Extremely reasonable prices. 2 hour long wait for Christmas dinner, though. Honestly, not worth more than a 45 minute wait... the prices definitely justify the wait.",0
"I don't normally write reviews but I felt compelled to because I came to Joe's Shangahi with a friend based on a recommendation and also reading Yelp reviews. First let me preface by saying I'm from Singapore and have eaten at some really darn good Xiao long bao restaurants in Singapore and Taiwan. The friend I was with had also lived in Singapore and Taiwan before though she's not Chinese. We ordered the regular pork XLB and the crab meat and pork XLB, plus the scallion pancakes and crispy pork based on Yelp reviews. I have one word - NO. To anyone expecting anything resembling Din Tai Fung XLB, you couldn't be further from this. Even though the skin was thicker than it should be and a lot of it, every single XLB tore off the lettuce leaf, but at least that gave us a chance to see the fat scum in the broth that came out of it. What we could salvage of the broth tasted blah. The scallion pancake was thick, deep fried and soaked in oil. The crispy shredded beef was really mediocre. Needless to say we didn't finish anything even though we had arrived with a XLB craving. The next day I went to another Shanghai Asian Manor for round two, I was hesitant from the previous experience but it was waaaayyy better - definitely go there instead!",0

"Nah man these are NOT the best soup dumplings.  The staff here were nothing short of obnoxious.  I can't believe there was a 2+ hour wait for some dang dumplings.  It has become a tourist oasis, everyone thinking that they are getting the best, where in turn there are so many other places better than this.  I was hugely disappointed by the soup dumplings because they were not filled with soup! The scallion pancake was probably the only good thing that we ate, and that was not even cooked correctly - it is not a deep fried pancake - it's supposed to be pan-fried! The pan-fried dumplings had no flavor either, just plain balls of meat with flour coating on it.  What did I even eat?  Everything was just oil with no flavor.  Dear tourists, steer clear of this one.  At least go to the Flushing location, Joe's Shanghai because this one is doing it ALL wrong.",0
"For second dinner we decided on Joe's Shanghai! They are known for their soup dumplings and we couldn't wait to try them :) We ordered some beers, tea and crab/pork soup dumplings. We also got some scallion pancakes as well. 
The soup dumplings were good but weren't the best I've had. The broth tasted great and you get plenty of crab but the meat itself I feel wasn't seasoned as well. The scallion pancakes were okay too. Overall the meal was just okay. Worth the try though!",0
The soup dumplings were gamey.  They serve the same food that's at a joint with a lit up menu over the counter.,0
"There were 4 of us that went at around 11pm and the place was packed! We really wanted to taste their uber popular soup dumplings so we sucked it up and waited 20 mins to get a table - which we also shared with a couple of strangers.

I am not a dumpling kind of gal but their soup dumplings were good, not the best (I've had better). Honestly, it was all about the broth. The dumpling itself was ordinary, but what made it juicy was the broth inside it.",0
"I am confused why this establishment has such great reviews the food was bland, mediocre, and forgettable.  The service was okay and the waiter surprisingly told our group not to order a dish because it was frozen.  The dumplings were just okay. Stay away and do not be fooled.",0
This place is packed with Good Chinese Food! The Soup Dumplings are to die for!We'll defly go back to this Place!I just dont like the idea of sharing table with other People.Otherwise its A okei.,0
"This place was super busy when we came around 8:30PM on a Thursday night. Luckily, we were seated within 15 minutes but they almost wouldn't seat us because even though we were the only group of 5 people waiting to be seated, the receptionist was convinced that there was another group before us... but there wasn't. We ordered 3 orders or the crab xiao long bao and 2 of the pork xiao long bao. They came out piping hot, which was great! Unfortunately, many of the xiao long baos (I'd say over half of our order) was broken so all the soup leaked out before they even touched our plates :( They were bigger than the ones I've had at Din Tai Fung, but the quality wasn't there. Other than the rude receptionist that seated us, the service inside was okay. Something to note is that they already add on tip to your bill so double check and make sure you don't double tip (unless you want to, then you're welcome to do that! :) ). This place is definitely quantity over quality, but it's decent for the price so give it a try and judge for yourself!",0
"I came here a bit early (10:50a) and there was already a line formed. Getting a table was no problem if you waited in line but at 11:10a, all tables except the larger table in the back was full. 

Soup dumplings are actually called Tang Bao but I guess here it's called xiao long bao. Anyways, make sure you tell the server what kind of soup dumplings and how many orders when he first approaches so you can get your food fast.

An order comes with 8, Burin and I shared one order which definitely made us content. The dough was cooked just right: soft and a bit chewy but not too chewy. Not sure if this is standard but there is an automatic gratuity of 15%.

We shared a table with a couple who ordered 4-5 dishes! They even admitted ordering too much but they enjoyed their entrees and even offered us some but we were already content and kindly declined their offer.",0
Been there so many times. Dumplings are good. But never know they put service charge even two people and not telling you. AWARE of that. We tipped every single time until we noticed last time..,0
"Friends and I waited for almost an hour to get a table, even though the girl told us 20 mins wait. We went from 2 people ahead of us to 4 because she let 2 Asian group in and not have them wait just like everyone else. We finally sat, please know, all dumplings are pork. The food was just like any other Fast food Chinese restaurant, nothing special. Not worth the wait and the hype.",0
"My son has been throwing up all day. I feel very queasy. This is very expensive junk. Unfresh and sketchy food that caused us food poisoning. We had the crab soup dumplings, twice cooked pork and the mai fun. Also, this isn't advertised anywhere but this restaurant is cash only. How is that still possible? The atm fees are outrageous of course. I don't understand how it is rated so highly on yelp",0
"Joe:

Our twelve year affair is over.  We're done.  

Yes, we've had good times.  I've overlooked your flaws (sub par food, rude service, excessive lines) because you had some very good qualities...ok, maybe just one good quality: soup dumplings.  

In truth, our relationship was built on soup dumplings.   I bent over backward, waited in the streets amongst garbage bags and the foul summertime smell of Chinatown.  I ignored others offering Xiao Long bao and saw only you.  

No more.  

Tonight,  after waiting an hour in the stank streets, you gave me a steam tray full of soup-less dumplings.  Two batches of deflated sacks.  Why you wanna play me like that?  And in front of my out of town guests, no less.   

Then, a roach crawled across our table.  A ROACH.  I threw up a little in my mouth.  I felt itchy all over.

The shine has officially worn off.   Even if I have to learn to make Xiao Long Bao myself, I'm never coming back.  We're through.  Adios. 
F*ck you, Joe, I'm so over you.",0
Food is great but expect not get homey service. Depending on your race you can get treated well or poorly. If you don't order enough food for the table they try to rush you and sometimes the check is given to you at the table without it being completed. It is a get in get out establishment.,0
"Very bad service. This restaurant caters to tourists. Not authentic Chinese food. We waited for 1.5 hours to get in and one of our dishes never came out. The waiter never showed up after taking the orders. The only person that helped us at the end was Jeff. He came and apologized for the lack of service and for missing the food. They included 18% service charge on the bill, which is fine if we got decent service.",0
Wow. Worst service ever! Why bother going here when there are so many other places to have XLB!! seriously rude staff - from the 'hostess' fixing her hair to the wait staff walking by. Forget it...absolute tourist trap.,0
"Oh my gosh. Those dumplings were fantastic. I came here because my mom's coworker recommended it. I must say though that the non-dumpling dishes that we ordered were rather bland. Their string beans were undercooked and very tasteless; my family only ate half the dish and didn't even bother to consider taking it home with us. So when you come here, JUST EAT THE DUMPLINGS.",0
"I heard about this place for having ""the best dumplings"" ever.

I tried the dumplings and they were good. Only good because of the sauce that came with it. I was craving the sauce, not the dumplings. 

And looking at the prestigious reviews articles and celebrity photographs hailed on the walls of Joe's, I find it quite disturbing that this establishment takes cash ONLY. 

It's like Michael Mina or Gordon Ramsay accepting cash only!",0
"Ordered wonton soup with shrimp wontons, Shanghai beef, Crispy Duck and Seafood with fried noodles. The crispy duck was ok, shanghai beef too soggy, Seafood with fried noodles, noodles was not crisp but the rest was ok. The wontons & steamed dumplings was the best part of the meal. Strangely the main course arrived before the soup & dumpling appetizer. Overall nothing to rave about.",0
"The worst wait and service experience. 

Person said the wait was going to be 15-20 mins., but ended up waiting an hour - namely because I was a party of 3 and a party of 5 was easier to seat. This logic makes no sense to me and why should this matter since you have to share a table with strangers. If I was given an honest estimate on the wait, I would've went someplace else.

Finally got seated and put my order in, which consisted of soup dumplings, a rice dish, and a vegetable dish. 

The waiters never said ""Happy Lunar New Year"" to my group, while many non-Asian customers received a warm welcome with New Year greetings. What a joke. I guess that's why 85% of the customers were non-Asian.

Ate the soup dumplings and they were good as usual. The rice dish came and, like typical asian dinners, the rice should be eaten with something, like the dam vegetable dish I ordered. 

We waited 15 mins. for the vegetable dish (while the rice was getting cold) and then ended up asking the waiter how long it will take, who went to check but never came back with an answer. I decided to cancel the vegetable dish and was given an attitude.

Paid my bill and collected my change and gave the waiter a $1 tip while he stood next to me to make sure I tipped.

Would not recommend this place to anyone.

From here on out, you're dead to me Joe Shanghai.",0
"First of all, I completely understand that Chinese restaurants are not known for their service. I have been to many Chinese restaurants in my lifetime. However, I actually walked out of Joe's Shanghai because the waitress/hostess was such a b word. We came in around 3PM on a Thursday.. it was busy but not the usual line out of door busy. There were 2 spots available, one was part of a larger table shared with other people and the other was a small 2 person spot in the corner that they were still cleaning. When she pointed us to the larger table, I asked if we could wait to sit at the smaller one. She yelled at me, saying that it was too busy and that that was all they had. 

I don't care if the waitress doesn't even talk to me as long as the food is good but yelling is uncalled for. Very disappointed.",0
"I've heard it's sooo good from friends but unfortunately it's pretty limited for those with a gluten allergy. I was able to get something, but it was plain chicken, rice, veggies and a little bland. Definitely grateful they had something to accommodate though and my friend enjoyed her meal!",0
"I've been here on a Monday for lunch, and it definitely wasn't crowded then!  The soup dumplings are pretty big and soupy, and the other food is satisfying.  Nothing spectacular though and a little bit greasy.  Since I'm currently living in a place devoid of decent Chinese food, it hits the spot for me.",0
"I eat quite often at Joe's....But I agree with some of the reviews. Some or should I say most of the food here are really nothing to rave about...but it's really a matter of KNOWING what to order. I've learned the good and the not so good. So next time you go, definitely order the pork soup dumplings (can't say much about the crab one since i'm allergic) they are known for these so you really can't go wrong! it's great especially during cold weather. Also try the beef fried rice cakes, scallion pancakes & vegetable with bean curd",0
"Restaurant is set up like a large dining hall. We ordered the pork soup dumplings and the boiled pork dumpling. The pork soup ones were pretty good, but lacking some flavor. The boiled pork ones were relatively average, but not bad. The waiting staff is very attentive and kind. Hot tea is complementary on the table and is delicious. The only downside to this restaurant is if you are a group of 4, you may be seated at a table for 6, which you will end up sharing with a random group of 2. The tables are circular as well so you'll most likely be sitting across from a random person.",0
"Ive been here a number of times.  

The smell outside of this restaurant is a test of willpower to any brave patron.  Of course you probably rationalize ""hey I'm being DARING and coming to Chinatown!  Gotta get used to a few putrid smells right?? Its authentic right??"" 

Literally every time I've been here its the same awful smell out front.  Sometimes with a green watery sludge nearby.  

On to the actual restaurant.  Soup dumplings - they are really good.  They are fatty and sticky and soupy, and porky, and they are good.  

Ive had many dishes ranging from chicken, noodles, steak, pork.  I would say that overall the meat scares me a little bit here.  Its always extra soft...not undercooked, but somehow doesn't have the texture of meat as I would expect it.  This happens with the chicken the most.  Perhaps they texturize the meat first?  Perhaps its just a texture I don't really like. 

I dunno about saying this is the BEST Chinese food I've had.  Its A-OK.",0
"The shao long baos (soupy buns) are the best here.  Be careful, soup inside buns is VERY HOT.  The other kitchen dishes are overly oily, I always feel heavy and gross after eating the noodles or other dishes. 

They pack you in like sardines and rush you out, kinda dingy too but must try the shao long baos with crab!",0
"Totally not impressed by the soup dumplings. My expectation may have been too high from reading the reviews. I was expecting the same standard as ones I had in Taiwan. Unfortunately, it was not close. The skin was too thick. The fillings were just okay. The dumplings were a little too big to feel delicate.

The service was efficient but robotic.",0
"When you go, order:
1. soup dumplings: the pork + seafood ones were better than just the pork ones
2. scallion pancakes: I grew up eating these things, and hands down, this place got great scallion pancakes

don't order:
1. jellyfish: bland bland bland.... again, my grandma always made this dish when I was a kid.. this place does not make their jellyfish well...
2. cold sesame noodle: nothing too special.. 

The thing I really didn't like was how I felt so stressed out the whole time I was eating there... rush rush rush..... I could not enjoy the delicious food even if I wanted to.",0
"When Joe's Shanghai first opened, it was like the hottest restaurant in Chinatown.  Now that the word has spread, I feel like the quality has declined slightly.  The dumplings are okay.  I prefer the crab to the pork, and you should make sure you order the soup dumplings right when you sit down since it takes 20 min to cook.  

After waiting forever, you are ushered into the craziness.  It's super crowded inside and the waitstaff totally rush you to eat faster and finish so they can give you the bill and seat the next waiting party.  Service can feel rude at times.  Terrible for large groups.  I stopped eating here since it's become a major tourist attraction.",0
"Jon- Our dumpling pilgrimage continues. My buddy Jaideep says this is the place. It was pretty good- but I think I'm more of a fan of Shanghai Cafe. The dumplings were aiiite. Big, filled with juice, and tasty, but I think they don't cut it the way Shanghai Cafe knocks them out of the park. And you only get 8 :(  All the places in LA give you 10!

We also ordered the green scallion pancakes, beef noodle soup, and hot and sour soup. I've been downing hot and sour since I was a kid. It was just a little hot, just a little sour. Didn't want to make the bold move. And where was the fungus?! Green scallion pancakes were too thick, too crispy. Doesn't match up to my grandma's. Beef noodle soup was just barely okay- some thin slices of tough beef, a few sparse greens, bland broth, and doughy noodles. Not bad. 

We didn't mind sharing tables, and the service is really attentive. I think it's funny how they ask you right away if you want dumplings. The waiter asked us first in Mandarin, then Cantonese, and then English in one breath! I chuckled. 

I'll come back here, but it ain't the best on the block. . .

Jenny-
This place is definitely overhyped, and after seeing all the attention from the press, I was disappointed.  The dumpling skins were thin, but every dumpling burst when barely even touched, and some of the juice was lost.  The hot and sour soup was blah.  It had shrimp and little pieces of pig blood in it, which I found interesting.  Not to toot my own horn, but my hot and sour soup is waaaaay better.  

Honestly, when I walked into the restaurant and saw that Asians were in the minority of the clientele, there was a high chance that the food was going to be disappointing.  The service was excellent, but I came here for good food, not good service.  Plus, the waiter kept trying to take away my food when I was still working on it. 

Jon-

I cannot vouch for Jenny's hot and sour soup. She has never made it for me :( And she always thinks a place is not authentic if there aren't a bunch of FOBs patronizing it.",0
"Naaaaa
I don't recommend here, I know more good place.
Go to Shanghai 21 at China town.",0
You'll want to look elsewhere. Food below par. Pork dumplings smelled and tasted like canned dog food. Actually that does a disservice to dog food. Don't bother asking about minor changes or substitutions. Customer service seems to be a foreign concept. Cash only joint. 15% gratuity automatically added to bill and it shows in the crappy service and attitudes.,0
"We came by on a Wednesday evening and ordered takeout.  We ordered crab and pork dumplings and double cooked pork.  The food was good however the service is not so much.  The girl placing the grubhub orders on a table will elbow you snd push you out of the way, personally not how I would treat customers, it's a cash only place, wait they take grub hub orders how can you be cash only then  but they say they are. If you ask for extra sauce packets or hot sauce packets you start getting dirty looks.",0
"I was deceived by Yelp's rating of this place. Yelp stars should be given based on a combination of things -- taste, service, decor, etc. 

First, it felt weird that the waiters were giving non-Asian customers the special treatment -- shaking their hands, saying Happy Lunar New Year, etc. -- while my Asian party was given a less friendly attitude. For God sakes, we're Asian; at least wish us Happy New Year too! I know that non-Asian customers are the bulk of your business (80% of the customers in the restaurant were non-Asian), but show your own people some love too!

Second, the dam waiter's thumb was swimming in the vinegar sauce for the soup dumpling when he brought it to out table. GROSS!

Third, two dishes that should have been served at the same time were served separately. We decided to cancel the order, but was given an attitude.  

Fourth, the bathroom was filthy, which made me think back to the waiter's thumb swimming in my vinegar sauce.

Would recommend people not to go here; there are other soup dumpling restaurants that are just as good.",0
"LOVE the dumplings, both pork and crab are very food. 

other than dumplings, everything else is extremely greasy, i meant EXTREMELY. thats a huge no no for me. I would def come here for the dumplings and probably JUST the dumplings",0
I hate when I am hyped up about a restaurant and go to find out the food is blan and just sucks,0
"The XLB is very good. plumpy, juicy, as good as the ones in Shanghai.
Serice is rude, room is crowd, which is actually ok for me. Nevertheless, EVERYTHING ELSE is pretty bad, not authentic Shanghaiese cuisine at all.

Recommendation: XLB (steamed dumplings) ONLY,  they are GOOD!Ordering anything else and you will regret.",0
"SO maybe I am not the best person in the world to rate this, given that I am not the biggest fan of Chinese food, but I am not sure what all the hype is about. 

I will start with the positives -- the Kung Pao Chicken and soup dumplings are delicious. The soup dumplings are filled with broth and pork, and have the perfect consistency, which explains why Joe's is known for this dish.  I also enjoyed the crunchy shrimp in meat sauce - which is a bit of a tangy, spicy dish FYI.

Ok now for the negatives: As for the rest of the food, though, I was pretty underwhelmed. We ordered the crispy beef, flat noodles and general tso's chicken as well as one additional dish, and none were really incredible. It also didn't help that the food rating outside was a ""B"".  Also, the service was terrible. There is a long line to get in and the servers stand next to your table, grilling you until you leave. They don't bring you any water and when you ask for it seem annoyed and they tend to ignore you every time they walk past. Overall, it was a pretty ""mehh"" experience and I don't think I will be going back.",0
"This was not the same Joe's Shanghai experience I had when I went there ten years ago. The dumplings aren't as fresh, the meat inside is typical take out mystery meat, and the broth inside is now greasy where it was once fresh and brothy. I was very disappointed. I was ready for a one of a kind experience and got something more along the lines of    a better than average Chinese take out experience",0
"The food is everything cracked up to be but for Yelp's sakes, please accept credit card for the convenience of your guests. Who cares, just charge a surtax for credit card use. This will really help out business and foreign travelers.

I'm a Din Tai Fung fan myself but I can appreciate Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings. Worth a visit and it is fun looking for it.",0
"Like everyone says, you can't beat the soup dumplings. Had both kinds (pork and crab-pork), and they were delicious. Should have stopped there. Also ordered the Crispy Pepper Skin Duckling (influenced by a 20-year-old daily news review in the window), which was not that great. dry, flavorless. win some, lose some!",0
"I don't know what the hype for this place is. Honestly, it's just alright in my book.  The xiao long baos weren't even memorable for me, and didn't leave me craving for more.  I think Shanghai cafe is a lot better than this place.  Of the dishes I've ordered here, none of them left me wanting more.  

I got the scallion pancakes, and they were alright. The soup dumplings (xiao long bao) were just ok....maybe it's the skin.  It was thick compared to other places I've had them.  meh...I don't even feel like describing anything else...it was just ok.",0
Ok food. Not very authentic. Xiao Long bao was good but definitely not the best. Yes you should try it. Is it going to WOW you? Probably not.,0
"first impression of this place:  the place is packed with non-asian people.  this must be a ""westerner trap"".  no person that really eats chinese food would appreciate this place.

yes, meh, i've experienced better.  try ANY place that serves shanghai food in California and you will find better xiao long bao, or ""soup dumplings"" as those new to chinese/taiwanese food will call them.  the meat was NOT juciy, the skin was much thicker than i would like, and the wait is ridiculous.  as for other food: i've had better stuff at panda express. 

save your money and visit din tai fung.",0
"If you're asian and have tried actual authentic Chinese food, this place is not worth it. Leave now. Notice how there's no asians here, it's all tourists. The wait is short, but that's because they sit multiple groups at one table. It was the most awkward dinner I've ever had 

The food at most is just average.The infamous soup dumplings were mediocre. The outside skin is pretty thin which is a plus but the fillings were rough and I couldn't even taste any crab in it. The rest of the food is average, however I saw the roasted duck and it looked pretty good to me. Maybe try that? I""d recommend just walking over to Little Italy and eating there.",0
"I guess sometimes Yelp ratings can be deceiving, as I had high expectations coming to Joe's Shanghai, and left slightly disappointed. Located off of main roads in Chinatown, it's a small hole in the wall kinda place, surrounded by an abundance of other Asian restaurants. As with most Chinese restaurants across the USA and Canada, you're not really going for the best decor or ambiance, cause you're definitely not going to find it haha.

We ordered a few things to share, including the steamed pork dumplings and the Xi Long Bao (steamed soup dumplings). The steamed pork dumplings, despite being $10, really mimicked the ones you could get in a bulk bag at the grocery store. Served with vinegar, it didn't taste bad, but it definitely wasn't super fresh nor mindblowing. I will admit, the soup dumplings were far better and definitely the redeeming factor. They were massive in size and were piping hot and fresh. 

I wouldn't say this restaurant is a huge standout among all the Asian restaurants in NYC, but if you find yourself in the area, the steamed soup dumplings were really tasty and good value!",0
"What am I missing???
Not a fan. I didn't come into this expecting 5 star service, didn't come into it expecting 5 star cleanliness, but was expecting delicious xiao long baos from the rave recommendations from friends. Alas, I should've known, looking at the walls lined with celebrity pictures... 

The XLBs were really big, difficult to eat in one bite. However, the real catch was, the skin/dough wrap was really inconsistent and roughly textured. We tried both the pork and the crab filling. The crab filling was really clumpy. 

We also ordered chicken Shanghai rice cakes and a plate of bok choy. The rice cakes were also really inconsistent in texture: chewy and soft. (Not sure if this is just Shanghai-nese style? Nevertheless, it was very inconsistent) The bok choy was fine.

Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait. I feel as though if we did need to wait, I would've disliked it even more... Not worth it! Lastly, I felt extremely unclean eating here. Was not a pleasant experience.",0
"Very underwhelming. We ordered the shrimp spring roll, pork meat soup dumplings, prawns in chili sauce, and the Shanghai sautéed flat noodles. For a singular spring roll that cost $5, it wasn't anything special. The pork meat soup dumplings were okay; the dough was very chewy. The sautéed flat noodles were also alright, it had more vegetables than noodles. But the spicy prawns in chili sauce were the best out of everything. This place wouldn't be my first choice to recommend in NYC for soup dumplings, but it was worth a try.",0
"Not a fan and don't understand the hype. We waited forever to get incredibly greasy flavorless Chinese food and share a table with incredibly annoying tourists. Why?! The soup dumplings all had pork so I couldn't try them, but my friends were not particularly impressed, including my friends from China who are obsessed with soup dumplings.",0
"We lined up for over 40 minutes to be served. We ordered soup dumplings, baby shrimp, beef and vegetable. It is fair to say only the taste of soup dumplings and vegetable could be accepted from a Chinese point of view.",0
"Poor service. I did think it was interesting that we were sat at a table with others unannounced- the place was packed. The dumplings were disappointing, but not bad. The jelly fish appetizer was good, but plain. The broccoli and mushroom vegetable appetizer was good.",0
Soup dumplings is what they are known for and I can say it's yummy. It has become a tourist spot due to many celebs going there. Long wait line and have to sit with random strangers at tables. Service wants you to eat fast and gtfo to service other people. Decor is non existent and cash only. 2/5 for me just because good food is still existent is this bustling place.,0
"The thing about this place is that they are always rushing you out the door. The minute your food drops they haunt your table in hopes that your almost done. They basically start clearing the minute the dish looks half empty. The dumplings are fantastic however. They really do a great job with those pork dumplings and I love them... BUT everything else is mediocre. I guess I would say get the scallion pancakes and the red bean dessert...but nothing is comparable to those dumplings. The service really sucks. I mean, they're quick and your order comes out right away...but you don't feel welcomed to stay and enjoy your meal. It feels like your in a fast food service environment so just be aware.",0
"So, after viewing on yelp how highly recommended this dim sum restaurant was, we made it priority to go while visiting NYC.. I was expecting all the dim sum appetizer dishes to be great; but they were really nothing special.. Their dumplings were definitely delicious as well as their scallion pancakes.",0
"I was so excited to try this place as it is supposed to be known for the XLBs. But, sadly this place is all hype. We got the dumplings (xiao long bao), crispy beef, and soup (can't remember what kind). The crispy beef was ok. It wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be. The soup was not memorable. Their famous XLB was bleh. The weird chunky soup inside had a strange taste to it. The consistency reminded me of a watered down chunky gravy. I prefer the clear soup inside the XLB from Mama Lu or Din Tai Fung. 

The place is tiny. They divide tables up so you are sitting in a round average sized Chinese restaurant table cramped with 2 different parties.",0
"This place is crazy, in good and bad ways. 

First, the good:
-soup dumplings are pretty good. Would I wait 30+ mins for it again? Probably not. Do I think other Shanghainese restaurants have just as good soup dumplings? For sure. 
-prices are decent for NYC. Average per person comes to $27 a person, after drinks and food. 
-service is fast. We got our order taken and out in 15-30 mins. 

The bad:
-every other dish besides the Chinese food is VERY VERY bland. Fast food Chinese food is much tastier than what we got. We had the spicy roast duck and the fried pork....it was both BELOW AVERAGE. The duck was over cooked and the fried pork was chewy in the inside and the outside was hard. We were really disappointed.  
-the waiter was really rude and abrasive. He has a major attitude with our family and we excused him because they were busy but if it was a tip based restaurant, we wouldn't have left any. 
-Oh yeah, a mandatory 15% tip is added on to each bill. 
-the lines to get in average 30+ mins.
-small tables - can only fit so much and barley have space to eat. My hands kept touching my neighbors. 

Overall, pretty poor service and food. Yes the dumplings are good but I wouldn't go here again.",0
"2.5 - even 3 stars. (Rounded down for uncleanliness and notably bad service.)

Alright, so I ended up coming here for at least an unexpected third time after my last review. For some reason, everyone in NYC just seems to want to visit this place?? A friend and I were around the area (in SoHo/Nolita), and we were deciding between Lombardi's Pizza or Joe's Shanghai (we had been to both already). She seemed to prefer Joe's Shanghai for the price...so I went along with it with little fuss...although as my previous review suggests, I'm not the biggest fan of the place. Haha. 

I don't remember there being much of a wait for the two of us. But this was the first time I had to share a large table with two (actually, I think three) other parties. Another time I was with one friend, and I guess we were lucky to get a table for two. Anyway, this time around, friend and I were the only two Asians on a large, circular table with a couple of white European tourists, and out of towners. There was one particularly obnoxious man who throughout the meal insisted that he knew all the best things to order on the menu, as if everyone around him wanted his ""expertise."" This guy went on forever...literally throughout the meal...which made my dumplings even harder to digest...friend and I just could not get over how ridiculous this guy was. And he recommended random fish dishes instead of the dumplings... 

Anyway, seating like that is just another reason to avoid this place. It is also so dirty and grimy (even for Asian restaurant standards) that I would not bring my Chinese family here... And especially considering all the other options around, there is little reason (other than the very inexpensive price) to come here.

Not to mention, the oily, grimy-textured dumplings didn't sit too well this time around with my friend's stomach...",0
"Known for their soup dumplings which are indeed excellent; but just two varieties- pork & crab and pork. Little else that would be considered dim sum (no other dumplings, shrimp or otherwise; no roast meats, turnip cakes have pork in them, etc) so I have no idea why it gets listed under top dim sum places. The other dishes I saw around looked heavily greasy and uninteresting.",0
"The food here is a good but not anything extra-ordinary. It's not something I would wait a long time for. We waited about 20 minutes. Service was quick and easy. Soup dumplings are big and tasty, but again, not something I would go out of my way for.",0
"The cold sesame noodles are delicious! But the ""C"" on the storefront leaves me thinking...I hope it was cold sesame noodles I ate...",0
"I know, everyone loves this place. Not me. I have been there twice...both times take-out. First time the young woman who took my order was very nice and friendly. She made suggestions and was quite helpful.  However, the food was all very underwhelming. Fast-forward a year and another disappointing experience today. On way home from work I passed it and thought I would give it another try...as it was kinda empty. This time the two women at the counter who took my order were not friendly or helpful. I understand the language barrier, but if I have a question and they can't understand me or answer it, would it not be the end of the world to have one of their co-workers who does speak English help out?  But they were not very interested in helping me. When I asked the host for a menu he did not even want to be bothered to move aside so I could grab one. Overall even putting the language barrier aside, the contact I had with the staff today was cold.

The soup dumplings were good...but not amazing. The scallion pancakes were great, but they are good at a lot of places. Although the place was kinda empty, the people who were there were mostly tourists.  Maybe I have not ordered right the times I have been there, but in my opinion this place is not so much a hidden gem, more like a over-hyped tourist trap.",0
Okay shanghai dumplings. This place has great reviews and was referred by a friend while I'm visiting NYC. I don't know if I would get in line for this place. (We didn't have much of a wait during lunchtime on a weekend.) I had much better dumplings in ding tai fung and other shanghai places.,0
"Meh. 

You ask, ""HYPE or the REAL DEAL?"" Unfortunately, HYPE.

I only came here for the Xiao Long Bao.

So.... my bar might have been set a little too high.

In retrospect, my problem was that I had been missing and craving Din Tai Fung so much since my last trip to Indonesia in November 2011. Especially so since my OB/GYN asked me to cancel my trip back home when we discovered I was pregnant with my first. 

In my mind, the PERFECT Xiao Long Bao must meet the following requirements:
1.) Thin, slightly translucent wrappers that don't tear when you lift them onto your spoon. (Joe's wrappers were too thick, kind of gummy, and yet tear surprisingly easily, relatively.)
2.) Well-flavored soup. (Joe's soup was just decently flavored.)
3.) Bite-sized portions. A larger quantity of regular-sized XLB would be better than fewer giant-sized XLB. (Joe's dumplings were way too big.)

I'm going to need to give Yank Sing's XLB another try when I get back to the Bay Area. I could be wrong, but I feel like even Yank Sing has Joe's Shanghai beat.

If that doesn't satisfy my craving, I'll have to take yet another secret trip (doubt Dr. Green will ever read this review) down to SoCal to visit the Din Tai Fung in Arcadia. Sure, the crab XLB (too fishy) & ""Shrimp & Pork Wonton w/ Spicy Sauce"" (not as sour nor at all spicy in the US) are still not as delicious as the one in Jakarta or Beijing, but at least they have great pork XLB.

* CRAB & PORK XIAO LONG BAO - [3/5] 
* PORK XIAO LONG BAO - [3/5]",0
"For a tourist trap place, Joe's Shanghai is not terrible. That being said, I only got the soup dumplings - one pork and one crab - so I cannot attest to the other food. Honestly, the soup dumplings were pretty good and had lots of meat and soup inside, which is pretty surprising (most places skimp on the meat). The crab had an interesting flavor, and it's not bad, but I think the pork is definitely better. The pork soup was really good, even though I burnt my tongue on the first sip. The only complaint I have is that the skin of the soup dumplings were sticking to my lips every time I took a bite. 

The other food looked kind of mid and was pretty expensive, but I don't know if you should expect authenticity if none of the other diners are Chinese. Also, this place is cash only and adds an automatic 18% gratuity, which is a little weird for bare minimum service. This restaurant is definitely geared towards tourists, but the interior is clean and the soup dumplings are pretty good.",0
"After hearing such great things about soup dumplings I had to try them.  This place was supposed to be the best but I left disappointed.  I didn't think they tasted that great.  The price was fair, around $5 for eight dumplings.",0
"Why on earth does this place get so much hype?  Is it just merely because there's no good Chinese food in NYC?  
I'm from California and I'm going to admit - I am a big fan of Ding Tai Fung.  I've heard mixed reviews from my friends as to which joint is better but I would have to say Ding Tai Fung for sure!  

Here's what we ordered:
Xiao long bao
Szechuan Beef Tendon Noodle Soup
Vegetables

Xiao long bao isn't that great as the skin is super thick.  
Szechuan Beef Tendon Noodle Soup was a disappointment as it was quite bland for a spicy dish.  I had to dunk hot sauce in the soup for flavor. 
I guess you can't really go wrong with vegetables but it was $9.95 vs. the xiao long bao and noodle soup that were $4.95.  

The only plus side is that this place is pretty cheap.  I mean 8 xiao long bao for $4.95 is a great deal but why torture yourself to cheap bad food?  

Two thumbs down!  I'm never coming back!",0
"I was told that there was going to be a long wait for it, but there wasn't. We were seated pretty quickly. I was told that the dumplings were really good, and they were yummy. We ate the pork soup dumplings, and it's only the second time I've eaten soup dumplings, so not much to compare it to. The soup was good, but I had more noodles than broth. The beef rice cakes were yummy, we took them home with us. Wish it was a little cleaner, and less crowded for seating.",0
"This i what I don't understand.   The front of the store is narrow. the  Smell from last night garbage still there  / One morning I found a dead rat right outside the sideway in front of the resturant .  
 
and these tourist still stand in front this smell.  - what class.


The owners attempted to repair the street of the pot hole but the pot holes are still showing up or coming back.

Dirty and Touristy 
Have to Share a Table with strangers
The back of the restaurant was kinda messy
Very tight seating
They rush you out when you are done.
Good food tho.

there should be 32"" between seating by Fire Department - Health Hazard if there was a fire and you had run of there.


Comments i have seen:

""Not very big on the communal dining aspect though.""

""The place is really busy on Friday and Saturday evenings, so the wait for a table will be a long time.""

""got seated right away at this big table with some other strangers ""

""This is no high class dining establishment... here you sit, you eat, you pay, and you leave (given a check before YOU ask for it)""

""The food is a bit greasy,""


Totally  Not a place where the Locals would be hanging at   but a  bridge and tunnel joint .

Nothing more dumber than a tourist going there than , standing out in the cold/heat (and the smell)  for over hour just to go in and eat and be rush out of there.   That is not the kind of new york experience I would want 

Still 2 stars.

Go to Nam Wah on Doyer, at least their sideway don't smell like last night trash",0
"We've  lived in the east coast for 25 yrs and moved to texas 6 months ago. And at those  time we ate here almost once a wk. were back for vacation and went to joe's shanghai for their specialty soup dumpling. They served us 5 pcs mini dumplings , warm not hot . Since we have not been here long time we thought that they made it smaller. We didn't complain. We ordered  take out 2 orders of dumplings. We reached home and my daughter opened the package to find  out that theyre bigger and same size as before. Apparently they served us a substandard food. Its a  shame . When i checked the pictures i've taken i found out that they served us collapsed dumplings the reason why it was small and dry.",0
"The Good:

Obviously the soup dumplings are amazing, pork over crab. 

The beef with scallions was fantastic, very good quality scallions and the beef was cooked just right, slightly crispy and full of flavor. 

The Bad:

The pork lo-mein and it was probably the worst I've ever had. The amount of grease was hard to believe, and even with all that grease, it lacked any flavor whatsoever. The pork didn't even look like pork, we thought they messed up the order. It looked like chicken, but it was dark and full of fat. Inedible. 

The chicken fried rice was not much better, I wouldn't order either of these dishes again.",0
"I went there with my friends to eat late lunch :) we didn't have to wait and could get in soon! That was the nicest point because usually we have wait !! There are two 小籠包 but I recommend you to choose meat with crub ! That one is better! Make sure when you eat, use spoon ! Because there are a lot of soup in 小籠包！and it's the most delicious part !!",0
"I had high hopes for this place since it's so popular but I was slightly disappointed.

Went in just to order a simple pork soup dumpling to go. Waited a couple mins and two other people came in to order take out as well. As the first bag of take out comes out I expected it to be mine because I was the only one who ordered one item. But no the lady at the counter claims it's the other ladies first when I was standing right there as I heard her order and pay for the same item I did ONE PORK SOUP DUMPLING. It was not worth an argument but it's not hard to remember who came first when all you do is stand at the counter and place take out orders and collect money. Anyways my ""order"" came out a minute after and I just grabbed it and left because I know the first one should've been mine and the one I took was supposed to be the other lady's. 

Although disappointed from the poor service I still had high hopes for the soup dumplings I was about to devour. Open the container and all I see are sloppy flat looking dumplings with all the soup surrounding it NOT IN THE DUMPLING. (Maybe this wouldn't have bothered me as much if I actually got my order instead of the one that came out after). As I pick up the dumpling with my chopstick the top just splits open inviting more soup to spill out over the tiny spoon. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the soup that I drank from the container, not the dumpling, was very flavorful. But the soup also left my lips really sticky which was very annoying. I didn't even finish all 8 dumplings because I just got annoyed with eating them. 

Maybe it would've been better to dine in but with those lines I would rather eat at other Shanghai places in Chinatown. But who knows maybe I'll be back to try some other dishes everyone raves about.",0
"This place is a favorite, but lately the juice buns have been a little overcooked and burst before I get them. The ambience is cheap and cheerful, and you often get seated with other people, but it's part of the fun. I wish they would go back to making the juice buns better. Their handmade sauteed noodles are delicious. Staff is OK, not superfriendly, but they get the job done.",0
It's the crab meat that makes these soup dumplings good especially since the classic place to go in Shanghai also does the same.,0
"Overrated, oily food, annoying strangers sit at the table with you. (But you might like that? :) 
Not a place to take a date. Been here 7 times at other people's request and can't really get into it.",0
Food was not bad but not good at all.  The service is terrible.  The servers are rude and rough.  I felt very offended and won't go back in my life.,0
"i've been here a handful of times over the years, but this last trip was surprisingly disappointing. 

obviously, the thing to order here are the juicy soup dumplings. we've ordered a bunch of other things like noodle soups and apps, but they're not memorable.

and if you're doing the dumplings, you should do the pork dumplings. that's the OG. the crab dumplings are just too rich. and this, coming from a huge lover of crabs, is saying something. 

it's cash only and they add in the service fee already, so remember that when you're automatically adding in the tip.",0
"Went with my friends. We ordered some soup dumplings, drunken chicken, rice cake with shrimps, and string beans.  Nothing was tasty!  The service was bad.  Waiters paid no attention to our table.  But put 18% tips on after tax.  That was so illegal!  It was the worst experience!  Over rated, over priced!  Don't even deserve one star.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is a restaurant famed in New York for its xiao long bao. Having hearing excellent things about it, it had long been on my places to eat, and we finally made our way here on the same day as the Chinese New Year parade. When we got here, it was 11:30am on a Sunday, and there was a large crowd standing outside the restaurant already. Much of the crowd's attention was directed to an argument between a group of prospective diners, and the hostesses handling the line. 
The supposed disagreement was due to the party stating they had enough people for a reservation, and had confirmed this over the phone, but found that when they got to the restaurant, the staff said there were no reservations offered at all. At one point, one of the staff members was shouting at the potential customer, which really wasn't a good look for the restaurant. 
Anyway, we managed to put our name down, were told it would be about a 25 minute wait. The wait time ended up being exactly that, and when finally our number was called, we had another brief wait for a table, but this time, inside the bustling restaurant. 
The inside of Joe's Shanghai is one of the busiest New York restaurants I have ever seen. There is barely standing room, and you will inadvertently push, or be pushed, just being inside the restaurant and standing. After a couple of minutes standing, we were then seated at a large, round share table. We ordered the crab and pork xiao long bao, the pork xiao long bao, and the scallion pancake. 
The food was served quickly after ordering. The scallion pancake was equivalent to other restaurants I have had this at. It was fried without being excessively oily, and retained a crisp exterior. It was not terrible but not something I would rave about, nor order again if I came here. 
Both of the xiao long baos were quite good, though not the best I have had before. They were cooked well, with the right amount of broth in them, and had good flavor, though I had a strong preference for the crab xiao long baos, which I thought were more flavorsome. 
Service was satisfactory and friendly, despite the public disagreement we had witnessed prior. This is a place I am content to visit once, as I've tried Shanghainese food equivalent to this place in New York, and without the long wait.",0
"Due to the high reviews i found on yelp, i decided to try this place in chinatown. Boy do i regret it! The wait was not bad for two but we were not informed we would end up sharing a large table with strangers. The first thing i noticed about this place was that 90% of the customers were well.. Not asian. Being asian myself, i have gone to hundreds of chinese restaurants. I found some of the items to be way overpriced. The 1/2 crispy duck was mostly small, boney, skin, fat and cost $18 dollars. Usually, this would cost much less in the surrounding restaurants or where im from. Although, my girlfriend did enjoy the crab and pork dumplings. i think it's truely overhyped and would never return. People should give surrounding restaurants a try as well. This restaurant is definitely capitalizing on it's yelp reviews and naive first time customers like me.",0
"I am SO SAD (and angry). Joe's Shanghai is dead. I used to crave these specific soup dumplings on a regular basis, make it a point to take friends from out of town here, and even dine at their midtown location. My hubbie and I went tonight and ate what was hands down the worst Chinese food I've ever had in NYC. Actually scratch that - the takeout restaurant in my upstate NY hometown is better these days. The crab and soup dumplings were painfully bland and had shells in them (totally changed from the amazing savory pockets of tastiness they used to be); the noodles came out in a solid ball and the waiter tried to tease it out like a hair knot at our table looking ashamed of himself (the sauce too was again, flavorless); and the new place has lost all of its vibe and feels like a shabby healthcare clinic. I don't even care about the long lines, the shitty service, and the fact that they now charge tip (probably bc they know you wouldn't want to leave any) - it's the travesty of having no sense of pride and respect for what this place once was (which was even a bit overrated but at least tasted good), clearly not caring at all about the quality of the food, and taking advantage of poor tourists just to make a buck. People - please do yourself a favor and stay away.",0
"Place is definitely over hyped.  Yes, they have extremely good soup dumplings, but let's also judge this place for other things.  The place is crowded and packed like a sardine can.  It's noisy.  The waiters rush the heck out of you.  Aren't you here paying for the whole experience?  So why is it I feel like the one that must bend over backwards to get some service?  Remember, you are the paying customer, not part of their, ""they get rich, you get out asap,"" plan.  The decor started out nice, but is really in the need of a make over now.   As for the other food here, it's okay, nothing above the other area establishments.  The price is slightly higher than the area competition.",0
The soup dumplings are yummy. We had other dishes also it was alright. The fried shrimp with sweet and sour sauce wasn't good. Other than that it's alright. Not worth all the hype.,0
"Just so so. Soup is too thickened with corn starch. The place is now a tourist spot, unlike it was 15 years ago. I am from Shanghai and was disappointed with the current quality.",0
"Living in Los Angeles and San Francisco, I've eaten at a lot of chinese restaurants and have grown to appreciate the finest of chinese foods.  I was pretty excited hearing about Joes Shanghai Dumplings and all the rave .  However, when the food came out, I was bitterly disappointed.  The dumpling meat was overcooked, drenched and soggy from too much liquid.  But, I also ordered the meat noodles and that was decent.  

Price: good. fair price for chinese food
Presenation: its chinese food so whatever
taste: okay, but not the best
service: chinese waiters are notorious for continuous PMS attitudes

Overall, I've had better.",0
"The steamed buns are the only thing worth here. Too bad. The service is horrible. Not only the waiters barely speak English,  they toss the plates at you. By the way, the gratuity is included in you check. Will never return to such a place. Do you want to enjoy Joe's Shanghai? Order steam buns to go. Everything else is overrated.",0
"We got here around 3:30 and there was already a wait.  You get a number from the hostess and you wait until she calls your number.  We waited about 20 mins.  

Once seated you will be sitting at a table with other patrons. It's definitely a little awkward but after a while you don't even notice the people at the table because you're busy eating.

We ordered the pork dumplings and crab dumplings. Both were just ok.  The soup seeped out of the dumplings and the skin was a little thick on some.

We also ordered scallion pancakes which were very delish.",0
"Tables are cramped in, service was absolutely disgraceful , signature dumplings were a 2/10 compared to Shanghai in melbourne. 

I recommend giving this place a miss",0
"We came around 1pm on a Thursday for lunch. It was crowded and we had to get a ticket to get seated. We had 3 orders of soup dumplings which turned out to be too much for 3 averagely hungry women. The soup dumplings are larger than other dim sum restaurants and are very doughy. They taste like a hearty beef broth inside.

Pluses:
- Seems authentic
- Food is good

Minuses:
- Cash only, and they automatically tack on all the service fees
- Servers are kind of rude
- Very chaotic environment
- Little conversational privacy since you're seated with other random people",0
"Not good. Came here because of all the good reviews but I don't see it. Really excited about the soup dumplings but was very disappointed. Chewy, over cooked, flavorless and greasy...The rest of the meal was mediocre at best...Oh, and let's not forget the rude service...also a great bonus...!
I'm sure there's a good soup dumpling somewhere in Chinatown, it's just not here...",0
"I'd heard about this place from a few people and saw the reviews on Yelp. People seemed to like it and I'm not sure if that played a role into my experience here but I felt that it was really overrated. 

I love soup dumplings. They're so flavorful and delicious. And the ones at Joe's were incredibly delicious! but based on what we ordered, that was the only thing I can recommend here. We also ordered a whole fish and beef and broccoli. Neither were that great and the beef and broccoli was mostly broccoli. I'd say it was about 3/4 broccoli, not even kidding. So from that standpoint, it was a rip off. 

On top of that, we had an hour wait for just the two of us at 8:30pm. I know you have to expect to wait here, and I did know that was going to happen, but I was hoping the food would have at least been worth it. If I find myself back here in the future, I know to only get the soup dumplings and then leave. That's what the table next to us did and I think they already knew that everything else on the menu just wasn't worth it.",0
"This place is overrated. However, I must confess that in addition to being a foodie, I've also spent a significant amount time in Asia. The xiao long bao are oversized and tasteless. The pork inside lacks the freshness and juiciness that a proper soup dumpling should possess.

We also ordered the string beans, Shanghai noodles and Yeung Chow fried rice. All were very greasy. The noodles were over cooked and the string beans hardly had any minced pork served with it.",0
"First time I had their steamed buns was great, but after trying a few other places. Shanghai village on Elizabeth or Mott street is much better. Also joe shanghais food is over priced. More for tourists now rather good comfort food",0
"First time visit. No waiting line cause today is raining. Quickly get seated, the staff forgot to give us water so we have to ask to remind them. Ordered their popular dishes. 

Spent over $100. 

XLB: it's not authentic XLB, the flavor is kinda off. I don't like it. 

Fried scallion pancake: I didn't finish the whole thing. Too greasy, and not crispy.

The dessert soup is way too sweet. 

I had a really high expectation before coming, and left with disappointment. Nothing special. Would not come back again.",0
"NYCgo website raved about the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai, so my friends and I decided to stop by while exploring Chinatown.  We went around 1:30pm.  The restaurant was still filled with customers, but we managed to get a table for 6 within 10 minutes.

We ordered the pork soup dumplings and the pork&crab dumplings.  Each order came with 8 dumplings.  The size of each dumpling was a little bit smaller than a golf ball.  The pieces that I ate were all filled with soup.  However, a couple of my friends said that their pieces were dry inside.

Overall, I thought the dumplings were average.  Not bad tasting, but I've had better.  Not tasty enough for my Asian taste buds.",0
"Damn fellow Yelpers.. I'm quite shocked by all the great reviews for this place because I wasn't impressed by anything I had here. Also quick tip, cash only. 

For a table of 4 people on a Friday night, the wait was about an hour or so which isn't too bad. Prepare to sit with strangers at your table. We got 4 orders of soup dumplings, 2 crab meat and 2 pork, an order of fried rice, and a plate of vegetables. 

I have had my share of soup dumplings and was hoping these would be comparable to Shanghai Manor (right around the corner on Mott St.). However as soon as I went to pick one up, I knew it wasn't going to be any good. The skin was on the thicker side, yet each one broke at the bottom when we picked it up. There was no flavor to either of them, they could've both been pork for all I know. The vegetables... bland. Fried rice, bland. 

I really don't understand the hype of this place. If you really want good soup dumplings without all the tourists, do yourself a favor and go to Shanghai Manor. The prices there are better too.",0
"This place always looks crowded. For me, it's overrated. I bought a seaweed fish. They gave me a tray of fish with a carton of white rice. No sauce. $20 something. The fish was so oily i couldnt finish it. I was tender. I really wanted to enjoy it esp bc of the reviews but I wont be going back.",0
"3 months after my visit I'm finally writing this review.

So I visited Joe's Shanghai on my 2nd trip to NY (Feb). Came here Sunday for lunch and the wait was about 30 mins. I guess it's not bad compared to how many people was there. 

Xiao Long Bao (crab meat) - skin is too thick but the fillings were good and juicy.
Xiao Long Bao (regular) - skin is thick too and the fillings were not as good as compared to the crab meat ones and it was also juicy.
Shanghai Fried Rice Cake - It was good but I've had better.
Shanghai Fried Noodle - also pretty good

I would come back here again for their Xiao Long Bao but just wished their skin could be as thin as Din Tai Fung's. Price here is a lot cheaper than Din Tai Fung's tho.",0
"We went there on a Monday night around 8:30pm.. was able to get a table super fast (yay), but we had to share the table with 4 other strangers :(.
I watching them fork n knife the soup dumplings away.. ( such a waste of soup )  :-o
Good thing the food came out really fast, hot and fresh. But  I was very disappointed after tasting it. Blah... greasy, and  flavorless.

on top of that, they did not use the right type of vinegar for the soup dumplings. There were barely gingers in the vinegar sauce... enough said.

When the bill came, I noticed they had already added 15% service charge. Is that standard in New York?? 

Overal, it could had been a 2 1/2 star, but do i even want to come back here again?? NO!!!",0
"We had a hard time finding this place, which was recommended by friends of ours. People come here for the food and the famous dumplings. Otherwise, there's not much to appreciate. Service can be sporadic, prices are Disneyland-like, and seating is uncomfortable. If you're not in a large group, you will most likely be seated with other parties around a large circular table. It's not all that weird because many Chinese restaurants do this, but I don't like hearing other peoples' conversations.",0
The place told us it was a 25 min wait and we waited an hour. Tables are shared and the food was not all that for the wait and line outside. The dumplings were not even that good. We orders beef that was shavings and was not good at all. Don't believe the hype.,0
"After a typical New York City weekend of shopping around SoHo, drinking PBRs until 4am, and eating frozen yogurt, all I wanted was Chinese delivery on my Sunday night.  My legs were tired from walking to the NBA store earlier in the afternoon, but I decided to make the 15 minute walk for the tasty food that I had heard about at this restaurant.  I was disappointed.  The food was one word: bad.  The dumplings were the only saving grace and that's honestly not saying much.  The noodle dish was bland at best.  The noodles were over salted and not cooked al dente.  I had to immediately throw the noodle dish away and take out the trash because it smelled up my house. The kung pao chicken made me want to punch someone.  I had two bites which is one more bite than I could handle of the noodle dish.  I would not suggest this restaurant...ever.  Walking through the extremely smelly and crowded streets of Chinatown to pick up this below par food ruined my Sunday night.",0
Pretty average dumplings. You'll find may places nearby are better. However they are the rudest of the lot. I swear the 3 waiters helping us were hovering so closely I could feel the heat off there junk!!! Pass.,0
"No dim sum here!

Was in Manhattan the other day with a hankering for Dim Sum . Used yelp to find a dim sum place and was directed to Joe's.

Got there around 12:30, was seated immediately.  But I didn't see any carts.  I asked the server about dim sum, and she said no carts, dim sum through the menu.  Looked through the menu.  The options were either hidden, or on another menu.  I got up and left.

Giving the place 3 stars out of courtesy.",0
"The dumplings were amazing! I got the Lo mein and it was okay, very large portion, probably wouldn't order it again. Lots of people waiting but moved quick!",0
":-0

Yikes.

I haven't been to the Chinatown location in a year, but I just went to the Flushing location, which my friends heard was better all around. More authentic, etc.

Hence, here are my 2 recommendation for your meal @ Joe's, if you are seeking authentic Chinese food.

     1) Get the Steamed Dumplings.
     2) Get nothing else.

"Love me some xiaolongbao. Especially on a chilly fall night. A party of 3 of us went for dinner on a Saturday evening so we already knew that we should be expecting a wait to be seated. We saw the massive crowd of people outside the shop on the otherwise empty-looking street and knew we had reached our destination. We got a number and were told the wait would be 30 minutes. I'm really not sure what the system is for seating here, a lot of people waiting seemed confused. A few times the girl would come outside and basically roll call everyone's numbers to see who was still waiting. For this reason, it's probably not a good idea to take a walk around the block while waiting for your number- they are not called in order or anything close to that. After about an hour and a half we finally got seated at a round table with 2 other parties. We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings with some beers right off the bat. Beers weren't super cheap, but dumpling price was on point. As others have noted, tip is included in your bill. Decided we would try another dish while we were there, so we also got the mapo tofu. The guy asked us if we also wanted to order rice with our mapo tofu, which was confusing since mapo tofu always comes with rice. It's not a dish you just eat straight by itself. OK, so we order some individual bowls of rice so we can eat the mapo tofu. Dumplings came first. They were very tasty and hit the spot. Slurp your heart out. No complaints with the side vinegar and ginger dipping sauce either. We finished these pretty quickly and then our mapo tofu and rice came out. The dish looked okay, but seriously lacked in any flavor (big flavor bang and numbing Szechuan peppercorn feeling is what defines mapo tofu). So this was a fail. We had to ask for the hot chili sauce and vinegar dipping sauce to mix with the tofu to even make it palatable enough to eat. We probably should have just stuck with what this restaurant specialized in- soup dumplings. We weren't a big fan of the host/waiter that kept hawking around the table, trying to pull dishes out from under you before you were even finished. It felt very uncomfortable, like he was just waiting to shove you out even though you were ordering multiple rounds of drinks and dishes and hadn't even been sitting down for a half hour yet. I understand there's a line outside, but come on, I just came from that line....after waiting for an hour and a half. Let me at least enjoy my meal in peace. Front of house staff was very friendly as we were leaving though.",0
"The Skinny: Joe's Shanghai is the ninth circle of Chinese food hell; (1)service: barely existent, the worst ambience, definitely not kid friendly(1); value: do not come here...you have been warned.(1)

My husband has a xiao long bao obsession. Normally I have no problem with this except for today when he chose to bring me, my parents and our 7 month old here. If thoughts were daggers, my hubby would be deader than Jon Snow with no hope of resurrection because I'd kill the Red Woman too. (I do not leave things to chance -I'd even birth an assassin shadow baby too).

First of all, the ambience is terrible even by Chinese restaurant standards. By terrible I mean the hub's cheap vinyl chair had a massive rip in it with foam bits sticking out. Not to mention the fact you get seated at filthy crowded communal tables. I didn't go to the restroom but the hub's did and can verify how disgusting it is. 

This place is definitely not baby friendly by any means. The hostess made us store our stroller in the front so my baby was on my lap. This meant I couldn't sit comfortably the whole time. And I want to be frank... My child is breastfed. I am not ashamed of breastfeeding my baby in public but I do not want to be in people's face about it especially while they are eating. The communal table meant that the four young people sitting across from us had to watch me breastfeed and change my kid (which is out of necessity and because we had no stroller to do so). Totally awkward. This joint made me feel like an animal wanting to chew off its leg to escape.

We ordered some pan-fried noodles, some soup, soup dumplings (regular and crab filled - 3 orders), green onion pancake and a dish of duck and vegetarian goose.

The dumplings were mediocre. Too large, too thick skin and half of them burst when handled. The pork flavor was minimal and tasted a lot like filler. The crab dumplings didn't taste like crab. It was oddly stringy...kind of tasted like crab from a tin.

The duck tasted old like some bad leftover duck. The vegetarian goose was horrible too. The green onion pancake was greasy and too thick.  The soup was a terrible mess of thickened salt water with peas and carrots floating around.

The pan-fried noodles with seafood were stir-fried with a bunch of broccoli, snow peas and carrots (completely saturated with a goopy sauce). This is pretty much a sign that this place is not legit and caters to a largely Caucasian crowd.

All of this terrible MSG ladened food set us back $75 before tip.

Avoid this place. There has got to be better Chinese food in NYC than this.",0
"waiter: ""WHAT DUMPLINGS DO YOU WANT?"".... wait what? i literally just sat down, i haven't even opened the menu yet!!! but people come here mainly for the soup dumplings & the abrupt waiters already know it (i guess it gets people in & out faster)

we ordered the 2 most yelp-recommended dishes:
-----the pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao): i've had better.. the soup inside was a bit game-y & SOUR.... BUT i liked the thin skin
-----scallion pancake: nice unique charred flavor!

FOODS CHEAP, but there are better xiao long baos & scallion pancakes elsewhere

NOTE: if you're a small party, you may be seated at a large table w/ strangers so that they can accommodate the large number of customers!",0
"Waaaaay overrated.   Poor service, greasy food, and always a crowd of people.  One of the dishes we ordered looked like it was reheated in the microwave.  I prefer Asia Manor on Mott Street.",0
"Not really worth the hype or the long wait in line. The only thing decent is the soup dumplings. Nothing really too special about these dumplings except for the size. Also, don't bother ordering anything else. Things I usually get at almost every Chinese restaurant does not look the same here and tastes pretty bad. If you want some soup dumplings, just go to any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown that offers dim sum and they should have it.",0
"On the night of December 2nd, Joe's Shanghai got 105 violation points from the health department... and I got food poisoning. It's too bad because the food tasted great.",0
"I love soup dumplings and joes got some decent dumplings. But to wait for a table and to deal with the staffs that thinks their better than their job, I'll pass. So many places in Chinatown to get decent dumplings, I'll have to pass.",0
"Crowded with law fans and tourists. I think they soup dumplings got bigger and less tasty but still one of the best places for shanghainese food. Last time i was there we ordered crab soup dumplings, pretty good and crispy duck, it will not disappoint. The jelly fish was very bad. Tasteless, flawerless, waterly, not fresh. I don't think i had jelly fish so bad. I don't understand how they managed to get this one wrong.",0
"Came in for xiaolongbao because the place is famous.  People are right : tourist trap!!  The service is poor.  My friend and I were seated at a large table with strangers.  We were not given the option to wait for a private table.  Before we had a chance to look at the menu, the waiter barked at us about ""soup dumplings"" (apparently, everyone comes for the xiaolongbao).  We ordered the standard pork/crab combination, as well as an order of mapo tofu (called something like ""home style spicy Szechuan bean curd"").  The xiaolongbao were decent, but just decent.  No need to write home.  Grand Sichuan's are clearly better, soupier, and tastier.  The mapo tofu was bland, not spicy at all, very little taste.  Had a generic feel to it.  Again, Grand Sichuan's mapo is much, much better--tastier, earthier, spicier.",0
Service was OK.Place is super busy. Food is Ok. Another place that is built on word of mouth rather than the quality of its food. It's like eating food cooked in 10-w30.,0
I have to say this restaurant is like a piece of shit. The only star is for onion pancake and fried rice. Three people spent 80 bucks on lunch but what we felt is eat 20 bucks food. The other food can be directly dropped in the rubbish bin.,0
"Overrated! Joe's Shanghai used to be a great restaurant serving authentic Shanghainese dishes but since it became very popular, the quality of their food noticeably went down in quality. We ordered XLB, crispy noodle and Peking duck. The noodle was okay, my son liked it, the CLB was decent - it was juicy but the wrapper was a little too thick - pls skip the duck it was not worth the price, the portion was small and the meat was dry, the skin was not crispy ( definitely not recommended!)",0
"This is a place to avoid n Chinatown.  It seems they stopped caring once they received their awards.  Maybe zaggot needs to give out Negative awards to places which clearly do no make the grade.
Let me be specific with some low lights.   pot stickers are greasy and have a
thick skin.  The soup dumpling shao lung pao were suppose to be delicate
with thin skin wanton wrapping, they were much larger in size.  and the
meat inside was very fatty and the soupy center was a bit of a goey mess.
Then the pan fried noodle consist of a  meat and vegetable topping over crunchy ""ramen"" like noodles.  Probably my mistake for ordering cantonese food in a shanghai restaurant.   
Then the pea pod greens sautéed with garlic was not very tender, chewy
and tough is not how this dish is suppose to be.
Oh i almost forgot to mention service.  I know in ny chinatown is not
known to to provide anything beyond good food at a good price.
we arrived early for a week day lunch and had five good size adults, and with the restaurant almost empty they want to sit us on table pinned to the wall, so we asked if we could sit at a table which had a little bit more 
room, the hostess rolled her eyes and threw the menus at the table 
we requested.  I wished i could have videoed this to a youtube on
how not to act in a service industry.   
Apparently they don't need any more new customers because they must have plenty of loyal followers who don't mind being treated like dirt.
They have a row of seats outside on the sidewalk for a waiting area.",0
"Fuck this place. Yeah I get it the dumplings are good. I can't say they are the best I've ever had but I think the prices are reasonable, the food is good, and the portions are of good size. The service sucked. Rude ass wait staff who couldn't care less. Beware 15% gratuity is ""built in"" to every check. I didn't think the service warranted 15% and they didn't get a dime more than that. This place was a complete disappointment.  Also note this is a cash only location.",0
"WARNING FOR PEANUT ALLERGIES!!!!

My cousin went here for dinner last night and ordered noodles with his dad. His dad took a bite and asked the waitress if there were nuts in them to which she said no. My cousin is extremely allergic to peanuts and didn't have his epi pen with him at this time. After his throat started swelling up they ask another waiter who confirms there are ""no nuts but there is peanut"" in the sauce (not sure why they didn't disclose this on the menu or confirm after the first time asking). This is a SERIOUS thing - restaurants need to a. Know what's in their food and b. Tell customers what's in the food before they eat it and almost die.

Best part is that they actually wanted payment for the food until the manager finally came out and realized how serious this was and didn't charge them. The free food didn't exactly cover the costs of an ambulance to the emergency room / medical costs that incurred so in summary would not be recommending this place for people with food allergies.",0
It was good but not the BEST of the BEST or so they say. Basically can have the same quality in any other chinese restaurant that makes soup based dumplings. Nothing special about it. Not worth the hype.,0
"Came here to try the food as I had read so many reviews about the dumplings here - this place is located in China town and we got here around 6:30 and got seated around 7 pm. This place has a nice ambience for a Chinese restaurant and the seating was also quite comfy. The service is mediocre though as the food took forever to come out in between dishes. We ended up ordering:

* pork soup dumpling - large pieces lots of soup and flavor

*crab soup dumpling - unique flavor and yummy taste

* sesame chicken - crispy and crunchy on the sweeter side

* lo mein noodles with beef - terrible with no flavor I would definitely skip this

Overall, didn't meet the hype for me but nice Chinese spot with lots of options for food.",0
"Super crowded. Sat with other people in a round table. Food came out pipping hot. Had to flag a waiter down for water. I ordered the soup dumplings w beef and shrimp, scallion pancake and spring rolls. The food appeared fresh. I had been shopping all day and I didn't take my food to go. I didn't get service while I was there so I couldn't look at pics on yelp when I was ordering.",0
"Somewhat disappointed by dinner at Joe's. I've been there two or three times now and feel like it is totally overhyped. The actual food is nothing special in the least! It's standard Chinese food...everything is fine but nothing outstanding. Just some regular sesame chicken, lo mein, etc.

Really, the only noteworthy thing on the menu is the soup dumplings. You can go with pork or with crab/pork so we had one order of each (8 dumplings to an order). They are delicious. The dumpling dough itself is thin and the soup inside was tasty. Only disappointment was that some of ours had no soup inside!!!!!!!! Not good! For seafood lovers like myself the crab is the way to go. The broth itself really tastes of delicious crab. If you aren't such a shellfish fiend, go with the standard pork.

For the amount of time to wait on line and the annoying drunk frat boys who were playing loud drinking games a few tables over (I feel very sorry for the poor people who had to share a table with them), it just wasn't worth it. I've been to some much better restaurants in Chinatown.",0
We had dumplings and Kung Pao chicken here. Both were pretty ordinary. We have had much better dumplings and Kung Pao chicken elsewhere. The waiter had a very bored look on his face and it seemed that he was quite unwilling to be our waiter. The service was average. We have been to much better Chinese restaurants overall -  with respect to the quality of food as well as the service. Just because it is in Chinatown in Manhattan and it is highly rated on Yelp doesn't make it a good Chinese restaurant.,0
We waited for an hour to be told that they are not making the dumplings right now and they don't know how much longer it will be.  Very disappointed!,0
"I don't get the hype.  We ordered both kinds of soup dumplings and they were decent but not outstanding.  My meter-stick for comparing this type of restaurants is how good their ja-jiang mien is, and this place is absolutely horrid.  It's literally just noodles with some runny goop heaped on that tastes like kungpao sauce.  I don't believe in a universal standard way of making all dishes but this is like rolling a stick of butter in instant coffee and calling it tiramisu.  I sincerely hope this isn't actually the best dumpling house that New York has to offer because it is far inferior to what I'm used to from the West Coast.",0
"Shanghai 'soupy' dumplings as big as your face. Ok, bigger than I have ever seen and definitely struggling to fit on a spoon/inside you face hole.  The bonus of being seated at a communal table means making friends and getting some good china town tips for further dumpling enlightenment. (Big Wong's and Prosperity Dumplings next on the list.) Also highly entertaining bants.",0
"I think Joe's Shanghai was definitely overhyped for me. Everyone would talk up their XLBs, so I was really excited to try them. I thought they were okay, but really not worth the hype or the long wait...or the hassle of getting cash. The XLBs felt clumsily made, and they didn't feel very fresh either, so that was pretty disappointing. We did try some other noodle dishes and those were decent, but also nothing to write home about. Prices are decent though, especially considering we're in NYC! As for the staff, much to their credit, they're very quick and efficient, so once you get seated, you can be assured you won't be waiting too long to get your food! I wouldn't necessarily recommend Joe's Shanghai, but if you were keen on trying it, I wouldn't try to discourage you from going.",0
"Cash Only. 

Pork Meat Soup Dumpling was delicious when It was hot. But I thought it became too oily when I had the last two. I shared the dish with my friend and I had four dumplings total.

Fried Dumpling was a ok but nothing special woul

Crispy Shredded Beef was like beef version's orange chicken. Overpriced. 

I wouldn't come back again because I didn't like the fact that we had to eat with other groups of customers at a same table.",0
"On my recent trip to NY, I was asked what I wanted to do while I was in town.  My only request was to a) eat ""real"" ramen (I live in FL and the ramen options are seriously lacking in this state) and b) eat soup dumplings....and soooo I checked out my trusty Yelp app and it pointed me in the direction of Joe's Shanghai.  Boy was I disappointed.  Probably out of all of the meals in the city, my dining experience at Joe's was the most lackluster.

I timed my visit perfectly.  There was absolutely no wait on the rainy Monday morning at 11am.  95% of the dining room was open...so why would they make my dining companion and myself sit at a table with 1 other diner.  I understood if it was busy or if we came in at lunch time....but really did they need to force us to sit with a stranger for no real reason besides laziness?

Moving onto the menu...well they have pork soup dumplings and crab.  Ordered both options and some additional menu items.  Don't get me wrong, the soup dumplings were good...just not great...and definitely not mind blowing.  Similar to the dumplings you can find at any standard dim sum restaurant but with some additional liquid inside.  The portions are fair and the prices are reasonable but not really worth making the trek all the way to Chinatown to experience these underwhelming bad boys.

They are cash only.  Also the dining room is small and they try to capitalize on dining space by making communal dining tables when it's busy.  Decoration is typical to a Chinese restaurant...not the cleanest or awe inspiring but standard Chinese restaurant vibe.

My real complaint was the service.  There really was none and the little we did made our dining experience less than enjoyable.  Interacting with our various servers was almost painful.  They forgot one of our orders...which to be honest wasn't a big deal but when it came time to pay the bill the server argued with me saying I never ordered the item...which come on kids who really forgets food they are looking forward to consuming.  Anyways I'd stay away...check out other options for soup dumplings on Yelp and/or restaurants in Chinatown.

Meh.",0
"Crowded as fuh.. . Filled with tourists and zero space between tables. We had to share a table or else stand around awkwardly waiting for one by the entrance. 

The soup dumplings were very good but a lot of places have good soup dumplings these days. 

What set this place apart from other Shanghainese was some of the other dishes. The giant meatballs had a great taste - I think consisting of worchister sauce and cumin. They were very tender and delectable. 

Just don't make the mistake of ordering Cantonese dishes here - the salt and pepper ribs were pretty mediocre. 

Prices are not exactly cheap for a hole in the wall crowded Chinese eatery but I'm happy for them to have ""made it"" with the tourist crowd. 

What's up with the ""C"" health inspection grade though?",0
"Please Bring Cash, and get ready to share a table with complete strangers and wait 45 mins ! 

The decor and the wait staff is below par but the soup dumplings are AWESOME! Its a bit expensive for NYC Chinatown but I guess if you are craving Soup Dumplings (Siu Long Bao) and Shanghai food this is the place to be.

My Picks:

Appetizers:
- Soup Dumplings (Siu Long Bao) Crab/Pork, I personally like Pork
- Scallion Pancake
- Cha Jang Mein (Noodles with Blackbean Sauce), this is a Big bowl

Main Course:
- SubGum Pan Fried Noodles
- Fried Rice Cakes",0
"I've been going to this place for years. The food is incredible. 

Must order items: Soup Dumplings, Scallion Pancake and the Sesame Chicken. 

It's a shame the service is terrible, the wait is incredibly long and the ""suggested tip"" of 15% is already included with your bill.  Shouting waiters that slam plates on the table can really ruin a meal. 

This would get 5 stars if it was take-out only.",0
Long wait and always a crowd. Decent steam dumplings but I've had better. Cheap food but they force a 18% tip. Weird for Chinatown in my mind.,0
"This place was good, but considering the fact that my dinner slots were limited to my trip to New York, I didn't think it was exceptionally great. 

To me, it just felt like any other decent Chinese restaurant that we can find in almost any well populated city. The Shanghai dumplings were in fact, pretty good, with lots of juiciness inside and a more of a salty flavor. In comparison to Din Tai Fung in Seattle, I would have been able to wait to eat at DTF and feel just as satisfied (or yet, more satisfied). This restaurant is your typical china town restaurant- busy, not much of an ambience, and the hustle and bustle of waiters. 

If you are compelled to try this place, I wouldn't say don't go, but there are SO many delicious foods in New York to try, I would probably go elsewhere and give this place a whirl if you are in the area.",0
"After getting lost to find this place, I really wanted to be at least 4 or even 5 stars, but I can't lie and will not be fair to those read this review for advice. So I am giving this place 2 1/2 to 3 stars. The 197 persons place is cramp once you walk in and you may sit with strangers while you eat. We were a party of 3 and luckily when we walked in, we were seated right away at our own table.

We went here for a reason and that was for their siu long bao (steam dumplings); however, since we were there, we wanted to try other things as well so we ordered the pan fried seafood noodles, onion pancakes, and fried yellow fish.

I have to admit, the siu long bao was worth being lost for about 10 minutes in the rain to find this place. They were big and juicy inside. When I say juicy, I mean juicy. It was filled with the broth and the skin was nice and soft. We ordered the pork and the crab one and I have to say the pork tasted way better. The crab has like a crabby taste, I mean I don't think it was bad but it didn't seem fresh. Oh, it reminded me crab in a can type thing.

The green onion pancakes were thick, crispy and filled with onion flavor which I enjoyed very much.

I don't know how yellow fish usually taste but I didn't like it very much even though it was fried with some sweet chili sauce. I guess is a milder fish. The pan fried seafood noodle is one of the worse pan fried noodles I had. I guess I expected the Cantonese way of making it but the noodles in this dish was white thick noodles, normally would not be for frying. The crispy noodles had the texture of foam and the soft part tasted like mushy spaghetti. I think the best part of this dish, was the scallops and shrimps, everything else seemed like it was from a can.

If I had to, I will just come back to this place for their green onion pancakes and siu long bao but other than that...I will pass.",0
Xiao long bao is good but fried rice is bad. I think you can order more xiao long bao and noodle.,0
Seven fat fish swim in a tank near the entrance to the restaurant. I am convinced that the souls of the waitstaff live exclusively inside of these fish.,0
"I read the reviews and saw the pictures but was not informed that I would be sharing a table with several complete strangers.  The food was fair and the service was very curt.  We ordered pork and crab dumplings that were fair honestly not as good as 101 Noodle Express in San Gabriel, CA.  Our second dish was the scallop pancake, which was good but rather small.  Pan fried rice cakes  with beef followed by black mushrooms with bamboo shoots rounded off our dining excursion.  The value was on point for the quality that was mediocre.  Please be mindful that they include tips on the bill so there is no need to provide gratuity.",0
"The Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) are DELICIOUS!
I went to Joe's Shanghai with two other friends, we ordered two orders of dumplings and one noodle, and this was enough.

I liked their crab meat xiao long bao better than their pork, but that is personal preference. I do suggest that you go and try both :)

This place is semi hidden in an alley...small and smelly street. bummer!

I went on a Tuesday for late lunch, so I didn't have to wait, but we did have to share a table with a person. Be prepared to wait longer if you go around noon or the weekends. I can see how crowded this place can be.

The reason for the 3 stars: 
-I liked only their dumpling, the noodle dish that we ordered was alright - not bad, but super oily - had better at other places
-it can get crowded. I personally don't like to share the table with another party, but it gets crowded, you don't really get a choice (unless you show up with enough friends to occupy a big table!)
-CASH only! remember to bring cash people! 

I would go back, but i'd stick with the xiao long baos only. However, I would like to try other places that can offer good xiao long bao and other dishes too :)",0
"Yes, the dumplings are good.  Yes, the food is Chinese.  But, what's up with the long waits and the overpriced food?  Is it because it's a tourist trap?  Yup.  Good for them.  Lucky for them!

I'd only go back if there was no wait, and if I weren't that hungry.  There are a multitude of other places where you can get as good food for half the price.",0
"I am devastated to see how much Joe's Shanghai has  increased their menu prices and it's astounding that not everyone is mentioning this here. 

 We were regulars here for many years back when they were located on Pell.  By regulars, I mean we were often there weekly either at this location or at their (now closed but very greatly missed) Flushing location.  We have only done take out from the Bowery location so far.  We've always loved the pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, crispy beef and pan fried crispy noodle. Also could never get enough of their chili oil.

But these prices are now absolutely insane.  I understand, COVID, COVID, COVID and transportation increases, the increase in prices of chicken and beef, supplies, and on and on. But come on, guys.  

Your competitors have increased their prices by a couple of dollars or $0.50 in many cases, but you guys have literally more than doubled your menu prices within the past year or two.  

This is so devastating and depressing bc many of us, who once had good salaries (after spending so many years getting advanced degrees) no longer have that excellent salary and, as a result, we currently cannot afford to spend $16.95 for for fried rice(!?!!), $19.95 for pan fried crispy noodle (?!!?), $24.95 for crispy beef (!?!?!),  and $14.95 for soup dumplings (WHAT?!!?).  Goodness even bokchoy is $19.95.

Oh, and after paying $14.95 for soup dumplings, I see that they aren't even packaged nicely. They are jammed together with all the precious soup 
leaked out at the bottom of the container. THe dumplings get totally torn up.  We do not have this issue when we take out from your competitors who are also charging 1/2 the price you are charging for better food. 

We drove by on Saturday, April 16 hoping to place a takeout order  but we couldn't believe these prices.  We couldn't even  bring ourselves to place an order due to their outrageous prices, and here I am two weeks later still feeling devastated by this.  You were among our favorite restaurants in NYC.  We even gladly suffered through the brusk service and being forced to sit on top of strangers just to enjoy this food. 

This inflation is so beyond what it should be.  How could you do this to your loyal customers? I am just so sad because I really miss this food and i am extremely disappointed in these decisions that you have made.

For those of you eating here, just think carefully about your money situation as we are living in a time in which things can change without warning.  There are far, far less expensive places that are on the same level (or even better) as Joe's Shanghai.  Just search online and you will find them.   Save your money by making wise choices especially if the food quantity and quality are better, or at the very least equivalent, elsewhere.",0
"This place is so overrated and not worth the hype. The only pro is the quick service and nice/clean interior. I'm not sure if there is just a decline in food quality since it's become so popular with tourists, but I didn't find any of the food we got enjoyable or flavorful at all. The scallion pancakes barely had any scallions in it and were really bland. The fried pork dumplings had no flavor, just grease, and the dough was way too thick and gummy. The pork soup dumplings were really big, making for a good portion size, but the skin was also way too thick, the soup was not clear or flavorful, and the filling was just okay. The dumpling skin to meat filling ratio was so off that we couldn't even eat most of the skin bc it was too much.",0
"We end up at Joe's due to extremely high volume of positive reviews on Yelp. We arrive on a Saturday night around 7:00pm and waited an hour for an open table. The wait wasn't the reason why I rated this place with a 3 star, it was just the mediocre dishes that garner the middle of the road rating.

First on the plate, the xiao long bao was not up to the standard that I am used to in Taipei or Los Angeles's Din Tai Fung, the skin was too thick near the top of the bao, the soup was fairly well represented, but the filling not well mixed between the lean and fat pork. There also a lack of sweetness in the filling. The The fried pork chop was dry and uninspiring. The fried rice was perfect in this otherwise average meal. 

If this what Chinese food taste like in NYC, I'll have to stick to steaks and pizza.",0
"I'm probably the only person that feels this way, but I was a little disappointed. Joe's Shanghai has such phenomenal reviews, and I was so excited to try their soup dumplings. They wrapper was a little too thick, and the filling was dry. Definitely not the best soup dumplings I've eaten. The sautéed green beans were absolutely amazing though. By far the best green beans I've eaten. Maybe I'll just need to return and try different dishes.",0
"The staff did not pay attention or come to your table unless you called for them. They stood around until they were called for. Even if you were ready to order and you looked like you are ready to order, they did not go over to you unless you called them over.

I was okay with sharing a table since it's often done in Chinese restaurants. But usually, there is a seat in between you and the separate party. We were elbow to elbow on a Tuesday afternoon and each time the large group spun the rotating tray or turntable in the middle, it would bump something. I sat with a seat in between at first and they were very insisted on having me move over (told me 4 times lol) and I eventually did. Turns out, they planned on putting another group of 2 at the same table, which now consisted of 3 groups (2 groups of 2 and a group of 6). This was my first experience at a restaurant sitting elbow to elbow with strangers when there were more than enough EMPTY tables for us to have sat a seat apart, more than enough tables for each group to have had our own tables. Was not the communal seating I expected or have always experienced. 

The pork soup dumpling tasted homemade, but the same usual filling that other restaurants and stores sell. Still delicious soup dumplings. I order Szechuan food for the spicy kick, I could not taste the spice, but I saw a small amount of Szechuan sauce. Tasted like any other beef noodle soup. 

tl;dr - overhyped, most likely won't visit anymore and if I do, its a no to sharing a table. (They don't usually ask you to share if its a group that fits their open table sizes; they have tables for groups of 2,4, and 10)",0
The dishes we order were tasty. It always crowd and long waiting time. The restaurant is cozy. Bad customer service. I didn't enjoy the food since I felt I have to rush to eat and get out from the restaurant.,0
"Hmmm. Coming from la, this is on par with din Thai fung. Shorter wait. 20 mins vs 90 minutes. Actual dumpling is larger but the actual wrapping is thicker. The meat could be cooked more thoroughly. 

Only disadvantage. They don't have as many dumpling selections when compared to the #1 spot in la",0
"Stumbled upon Joe's while in China Town, only to find out it was an acclaimed restaurant with plenty of reviews and high praises, which came as a delight! The concept was hilarious to me - tons of people crowded outside, one woman screaming numbers and giving you nearly 5 seconds to get to the door before moving onto the next. Amazing. 

After about 20 minutes we finally entered the restaurant to find a packed house. The restaurant moves quick, you're shoulder to shoulder with the people next to you and your server is at the table before you have even sat down. All amazing. Unfortunately however, the food was lacking. My girlfriend is vegetarian so we asked what was on the menu for us. The vegetarian shanghai noodles were a must. Unfortunately, our vegetarian shanghai noodles came with beef and only after a few fork fulls did we notice. This kind of threw things off. I'd suggest laying off the vegetarian duck as well, as it was really just cold mushrooms. 

While this is a slightly unfair review, we had read plenty that said it was great for vegetarians. The dumplings, which they are famous for, only come with meat/fish, there are no vegetarian spring rolls and I mean aside from that, who wants a plate of steamed vegetables? Next time I will be returning and trying the chicken / beef dishes. I'm sure those are good.",0
"I have been to this place before and yes they do have amazing soup dumplings. HOWEVER... I just had lunch there today and I have a fully backed COCKROACH stuck against one the dumplings!!!! It was the most disgusting scene and experience I have ever had at a restaurant.

We understand in CTOWN we take our chances but that crosses the line. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED",0
"This place is usually packed with a diversity of people from all over. Their hottest item on the menu is the juicy pork buns. Today I got to try some of the items on their menu and were not very crazy about most of them. I guess the only dish, besides the pork buns, I would have again is the pan fry noodles.",0
"Food: terrible. Extremely greasy and every single bite is coated in salty, greasy sauce. The sauce wasn't even mixed well, some piece of vegetables have so much sauce while some has no sauce. 

Service: terrible. The waiter seemed very rude and didn't even want to hear our questions. Condescending tone. 

Ambience: ok.",0
"To be honest, I don't understand why everyone likes this place. I think it's just a Xiao long bao place that all the kids and tourists go to. I've been to many other places that have better soup dumplings.",0
The soup dumplings are always good. They are what put this restaurant on the  map after all. The rest are standard Chinese cuisine. The only problem with this place is that they add 18 percent service charge to the bill automatically. And when they bring the change they leave out the receipt so I'd imagine some customers would leave more tip thinking that the bill didn't include it. That's some shady as fuck move. I am not against tipping and I normally tip 20 percent. But I'd like to have that choice rather than have the 18 percent included without my say in it. Just be aware.,0
"So my first on my NYC pigout.... came here bright and early on Tuesday for some XLBs. We had one order of the pork XLB, green onion pancake, and shanghai noodles....  Food came out quickly and service was medicore... thought the XLB's were juicy, large and of course fatty! Pretty good but for some reason wasn't all that impressed...due to jetlag? who knows... I'd probably go to Shanghai Cafe instead for some XLB grubbin..

Also they charge you a 15% ""service charge"" here for tip and its cash only.",0
"This is supposed to be a Shanghainese restaurant, right?  Well, I came in and ordered two ""longs"" of Little Dragon soup dumplings and the wine chicken - both of which are Shanghai classics - and I was sorely disappointed by both.  The soup dumplings were hot, but the broth was almost sour.  The dumplings themselves were too large - when dumplings are too large the meat inside of them do not cook right.  The wine chicken was a complete disaster - the smell was about right for this aromatic dish - but the taste was bland and oily.  The chicken itself was white instead of the traditional yellow for wine chicken and my girlfriend and I didn't even finish the dish.

This place is swarming with tourists.  If you want a more authentic Shanghai cuisine experience, go a couple doors down to Shanghai Gourmet for a more authentic experience.  There, they actually speak Shanghainese, I saw a bunch of Shanghai tourists munching down, and their soup dumplings are way better (although I did not try their wine chicken)",0
"It was all hype for us. 
Place was very crowded, outdated and the bathrooms were disgusting. The food was just okay, honestly the reviews on this place set my expectations a little too high which is probably why I was so disappointed. 
Cash only",0
"Horrible service, dirty and rude workers. Waited for half hour in the cold just so the front door girl can tell me they skipped my number",0
"Joe's Shanghai on Pell St. on Sunday night with six friends. Mobbed. We were told 20 minute wait for table--we waited 45 minutes and got seated with two strangers who hogged the table. Obnoxious servers who declined to offer any hints or suggestions from their multi-page menu. We each ordered different dishes with intrnt to share, but soup, appetizers and main dishes arrived all at the same time making it impossible to try to share anything. Waiters brought stacks of bowls and plates which we passed around the table. Empty dishes remained uncollected which made the table more of a garbage can than a place from which to eat food. Requests for tea refills went unanswered as did rèquests for water. Food was serviceable but nothing memorable. The din and crowd noise was headache level. Of course no credit card service and our individual checks were written in pencil on scraps of note paper. None of the waiters was able to decipher the bill or tell us the cost for individual items. So our group of seven got ripped off to the tune of more than $350. Mediocre food, absolutely the worst service since the Soviet Union went out of business. With at least a dozen superior restarants within a five minute walk I am totally baffled by the rave reviews for this unremarkable at best second rate dive.",0
"I ate dinner at Joe's Shanghai (crab/pork soup dumplings, vegetable lo mein and pepper shrimp) last night and by 4 a.m. was sick as a dog with food poisoning. Beware!",0
"It's been 3 years since I've come to Joe's Shanghai, and I always had fond memories of its soup dumplings, however, today's experience was a two thumbs down! My soup dumplings were super mediocre, the skin was a little 'rough' and the meat and soup tasted like they put too much MSG.

 I also ordered the cold sesame noodles, which was flavorful, but I bit into what tasted like hardened old noodles! No, no, no!  I guess with a restaurant this popular, the quality of the food has gone down and it doesn't really matter to them anymore. Too bad!",0
"This place clearly comes highly recommended.  I didn't love it.  Yes, there was a 30 min wait on a Thursday  at 6:30 but that was expected.  Ordered the pork soup dumplings, which were just average if not bland.  Tricky to eat, one exploded and shot out on my dress - you've been warned!  Also had Kung Pao chicken, again not great but to be fair, I don't eat peanuts so it may be better.  Also had double cooked pork, it was good but very garlicky.  Personally, I won't be back - too many great restaurants in NYC!",0
"If you like to dine in cacaphony sitting next to a bunch of strangers, go here.

Also, their soup dumplings are decent, but Shanghai Cuisine is better.

If you're in the market for Soup Dumplings, go to Shanghai Cuisine. I can't sing their praises over Joe's more than this.

Joe's: Annoyingly loud, crowded, long waits, mediocre-good dumplings.

Shanghai Cuisine: quiet, not crowded, decent service, best dumplings in NYC.",0
"First time back in years -- what a mistake. 

The XLBs were different sizes and shapes. Most were lopsided and thrown onto the bamboo basket with shreds of lettuce around the dumpling I couldn't peel off the skin. Three were torn with soup seeping out onto the lettuce. The worst part? The filling was greasy and the soup, an oily, scorching mess. 

Their XLBs are offensive, borderline criminal; simply hot messes.
(See photo for proof.)

It's like Joe's doesn't give a two sh*ts about quality anymore since they are so famous. I will never step foot in there again.

SCREW YOU, JOE'S.",0
"Very good food but poor service and too many people for what you get.

Pro:
- Great soup dumplings
- Other menus are pretty good too

Con:
- unfriendly and unresponsive staff
- unreasonably long wait during peak hours
- place is too full of people (uncomfortable)",0
Too busy..overly crowded. I've had better Chinese food and soup dumplings. It's overrated for what you actually get.,0
"This was my first time ever eating the ""dumplings with soup"" inside, so I didn't really know what to expect! We ended up waiting a mere 30 minutes, but I was impressed that the server said we'd be waiting 30 minutes. Not a minute more or less. There was a huge line outside so I could tell from the mixed crowd that Joe's Shanghai is pretty popular.

The funny thing about this place is that they seat you with random people in a huge round table. Forget about getting your own private table, you'll probably be rubbing elbows with some random person. But that's the fun part about being in New York!

All we got were pork dumplings and pork + crab dumplings. I honestly couldn't tell the difference in the two, but they were both really good! Just remember not to pop the entire thing in your mouth or you'll burn it (as it shows on a funny cartoon on the outside window)

The best part about this place was the bill. Including tip, it cost about $8 per person WITH DRINKS! Amazing!!! I was totally stuffed! 

I think I would have to visit one more time to see how consistent all of this is, but for now it's a 3 star place for me!!",0
"The food is just ok
Service sucks and the soup dumplings are ok but nearby noodle village is better",0
"This is not my first visit to Joe's Shanghai, but it's the first time I've been here in a while. Usually when I crave soup dumplings, I frequent two Shanghainese places on Mott Street. This time, I was with a friend who is new to soup dumplings, so I decided to take her to Joe's Shanghai since this place is more wellknown (so I assumed better). The last time I had been here was 3 years ago and I didn't remember much about the taste. 

Came as a party of 2 and didn't have to wait, but we were also right before the dinner rush. Wait service was good for chinatown, but I think that is because they cater to a large foreigner customer base. 

The food: we ordered a soup, pork soup dumplings, and beef pan fried noodles. The soup was okay, friend and I were both happy with it. The beef pan fried noodles were 3$ more expensive than the other places I go to, and did NOT taste as good. Greasy, oily, not authentic at all. 

However, my problem was with the soup dumplings. The middle dumpling was already leaking, and the ones on the side were all stuck to each other or stuck to the side. There was basically no way to eat them without having them all break. Maybe it was because I had ordered in English, and they thought I wouldn't know how soup dumplings should look?

Anyway, after some deliberation about whether we should just eat them or not, I called a waiter over and made the problem known in Chinese. The waiter seemed very surprised to hear me speaking his language fluently. He tried to be like ""oh, it's only one that's broken. It's very hard for the entire batch to all be perfect."" As he said this, he tried to move two of the dumplings that were stuck to each other on the side. As soon as he did, they both broke and started leaking soup. At this point, he gave up and just got us a new batch. The new batch was a little bit better but still had two/three that broke easily. 

All in all, I've never seen soup dumplings look that sad... at least the waiter was nice enough about getting us a new batch. These dumplings are definitely not the best in NYC; you get find better tasting ones for cheaper in many other places. 

Lesson learned -- more famous place does not mean better food. Everyone, go to Mott Street for your soup dumplings.",0
"Can someone please explain to me the hype over Joe's??? Think I'm missing something but my two experiences here have not warranted anything above an A-Okay Dumpling house.  Typical Chinese pushy in & out service, check.  Not so good XLB, check. Typical Chinatown hole in the wall, check. 

Skin is too thick and rough, takes actual skill, time & technique to craft a thin skin soup dumpling that doesn't fall apart.

Definitely not worth the wait.",0
"tl;dr:  AVOID THIS PLACE - food was subpar; service was almost non-existent; and they snuck in a 18% gratuity without informing us and then chased us down the road like raving lunatics to hustle another $10 out of us.  
----

The wife was craving some good chicken dumplings, so just like any other hapless tourist, I found this restaurant using our favorite search engine.  Read the glowing reviews there and on Yelp, so we took a subway down to Chinatown to get our hands on these dumplings everyone was talking about.  We arrived around 2:30 PM on Thursday (12/23/21) and had to wait about fifteen minutes to be seated.  The place was busy, but not overwhelmingly so.  

First thing I noticed was that the place only took cash, which I thought was a little strange considering how well it was rated by others and seemed to cater to a diverse, non-local only crowd.  Okay, no big deal.

We were seated and it took about 10 minutes until someone finally got around to coming by our table.  We were expecting them to have a full dumpling menu like most of the other Chinese restaurants in Manhattan, but no, they only had two types of dumplings - pork and vegetables.  Strike one for me, since my wife couldn't get the dumplings she was craving.  Since we were already there and were quite hungry, we decided to eat and we ordered a plate of veggie dumplings to start.  

Along with that, my wife ordered the sake and I ordered a Diet Coke, which took  another good while to arrive at our table.

Along with our dumplings, we ordered two dishes - I ordered the bean curd dish and my wife ordered the Singapore chow mein. 

The dumplings were okay at best and pretty much standard fare one would get at any random Chinese restaurant in the area - nothing special. 

The bean curd dish was just a plate of tofu with veggies, but with very little sauce or liquid.  It was also okay - nothing to write home about.  I ordered a side of rice to try to make more of a meal out of it.

My wife's chow mein was substandard with poorly cooked noodles.  She said the chicken was good and tasty, but the rest of the dish fairly bland and routine.

So we chalked it up to not reading the reviews closely and getting sucked into a tourist-trap type of restaurant and we finished up and asked for the bill.

This is what we ordered (with prices taken from their menu online):

Steam veg dumplings - $7.95
Sake - $8.95
Diet Coke - $2.25
Singapore Chow Mein - $11.95
Bean Curd Home Style - $12.95
Extra Rice - $3 (guessing, since it was not listed on the menu)

Total - $47.05 before tax

So we received a cash bill for something like $60 or so.  This means that they had already added 18% to the bill as a gratuity.  Being inattentive, I just put down $70, figured that a $10 tip should be sufficient for a $60 tab.  That's about a 15% tip I thought in my mind, which is generous considering how bad the service was.

For some reason, my wife had $3 more dollar bills in her pocket and she put those down too.  We normally tip 30% whenever we eat out, so I am guessing she felt bad that I had not tipped the usual percentage.

So we laid down $73 cash for a $60 bill, or about a 22% tip.

Now remember, this was an extra $13 tip on top of the 18% gratuity they had already added to our bill!

Without thinking much, we walked out of the restaurant and we were about half a block away when someone from the restaurants comes chasing after us yelling and carrying on.  I couldn't fully understand what he was saying, but it seemed that he was telling us that we had shorted them on the bill.  He was waving around the cash we had put on the table, but he was pointing at the bill and saying something that wasn't very intelligible.

My wife, not wanting to make a scene and wanting to make our next appointment and escape this raving lunatic just handed him an additional $10 bill and we walked away.  I guess we both looked like unsophisticated tourists to one of the restaurant staff, so thought they could hustle a bit more money out of us by startling us and by making a scene in the street.

So they essentially got $83 out of us for a $60 bill that itself was inflated with this hidden 18% gratuity.

We vowed to be more careful in reading online reviews and religiously avoiding hyped tourist-trap restaurants in the future.",0
Good soup dumplings and awesomely old school interior with neon lights. The place is bigger than it looks on the outside and service is quick and thorough!,0
"Didn't see what was so special about this place that warranted the reviews it is getting. The service sucked and was rude ate that. The restaurant was a hot mess and the food was nothing special. We had gotten Crispy Pork Chop with Pepper Salt and pork dumplings. Which were good, but nothing to rave about. Not to mention the location, on Pell, a dumpy back alley street that stank. Will not be coming back.",0
"To the girl who compared this to Din Tai Fung, no no.

4,000 reviews?! I had to come and try it. However, trouble from the start is that China Town parking is RIDICULOUS. Just try to park wherever you can, then walk! Walking will get you there faster, and you'll get to enjoy more scenery.

This is the first time that I've been seated WITH a random group. Alright, so it's 11:45am, and there's a good chunk of people waiting. The lady tells us 20minutes, which was a lot shorter than we were guessing. We planned on walking around, but we ended up staying and waiting. Good thing because we ended up getting seated in 10 minutes instead! What was NOT a good thing was the fact that my party of 3 was seated WITH another party of 3 that are already eating so that we fill up the 6 table perfectly. IT'S SO WEIRD. We just split the table, but you can't help but feel squished and uncomfortable.

Now, the comparison between DTF and here caught my eye. My top 2 dumpling houses are Din Tai Fung and Mama Lu's, and this place falls under these 2 in my opinion, for the debate was not very close. It costed $40 for 3 items, so it's pricing is between DTF and Mama Lu (with Mama Lu being the cheapest). The inside is small and kind of dirty, which drifts away from DTF and more towards Mama Lu's, but the dumpling is the most important factor. Although the dumplings are very big compared to regular ones, the juice inside is dull--nothing special. Mama Lu's is sweet, and DTF's is boldly spiked. The only one-up this place has is its size that makes it more filling.",0
"Joe's is pretty well OK in my book.

You come here to get xiaolongbao (literally, and quite comically, ""little juicy buns""), otherwise known as ""soup dumplings"" or ""Shanghai juicy dumplings,"" a specialty of that particular Chinese city.

They're relatively large as far as dumplings go, and they're basically pork meatballs with a little bit of spiced aspic stuffed into elastic and chewy wheat-flour wrappers. The aspic melts during cooking, filling the dumpling with ""soup,"" hence their name. Just don't chomp on them, as the scalding juice WILL squirt all over your face and leave you with painfully pink burns on your face for a few days! That goes for any xiaolongbao you ever eat, regardless of where.

Get 'em with the optional crab. My buddy, who's got a severe allergy to shellfish/iodine insisted on having them that way and he got sick (DUH!). Fortunately, both of us have been trained to deal with such emergencies!

They also made a really tasty salt-and-pepper fried quail.

Since I hail from the Chinese-food capital of the U.S. (the San Gabriel Valley, near Los Angeles), nothing in New York's Chinatown really appealed to me, but it served its purpose while I lived there. It's definitely worth a try!",0
"I really believe that people who gave this place anything higher than 2 stars have never had the authentic shanghai style soup dumplings (Xiaolongbao) or their are not Chinese. This place is terrible. I won't come back to eat even if the food is free, unless u pay me $50. 
I've never had such an awful Xiaolongbao. The size is like a fist big and the wrap is so thick, and I thought it has not enough juice inside! Authentic Xiaolongbao should be tiny, a bite size with wrap so thin, u can see through it. And have a lot of juice in it.
I have coworkers who thought this place was awesome and that i'm super picky. One of them are Texan and one of them are Mexican. So I told them, why don't we go to Applebee's for steak and taco bell for tacos? Then they stopped teasing me and apologized.
I wish I could give this place zero stars",0
"I haven't been to this famous soup dumpling landmark in a while.  Ever popular with both Chinese and non-Chinese patrons, it is perpetually packed and one reason I haven't visited for years.  Memorably, this was where I had soup dumplings for the first time over a decade ago.

It's a no frills, small-ish dining space primarily decorated by their numerous articles and media recognition pieces.  Cramped seating and tight spaces all around.  Service basic but adequate.  

Every table gets the soup dumplings and if you're not here for that, I don't know why you are.  Order one or two sets of 8 as soon as you arrive at your table, then take a seat and pick out the rest of your orders.  I prefer the crabmeat and pork over pork only.  The soft, tasty filling is encased in a thin, pliant skin, with a mouthful of soup inside.  After eating heavenly soup dumplings in Shanghai, I've had trouble finding satisfactory ones in NYC.  Joe's are good, not great.

Also had five spice beef (ok), fried cold tofu (better than expected, very tasty), scallion pancakes (lightly crisp, good balance of substance and thinness), tofu with crabmeat (delicious!), Shanghai fried rice cake (good but very oily), and the subgum casserole (HUGE portion, tons of items in the soup, good flavor).

Overall a decent meal, if not exceptional.",0
"Heard about this place from several reviews and a coworker about how awesome it is and I'll say it lived up to the hype, but not necessarily the OVERhype. Came here with family and they were all impressed with the food - got the scallion pancake, soup dumplings, kung pao chicken, singapore noodles and the chicken fried rice. Food had simple flavors.. spicy dishes weren't very spicy (probably a 3 on a scale of 10)?

No reservations and we had a half hour wait around 6:30 on a Thursday! Food came out quickly though. Overall a decent place but there are many good eats in this city so if the wait's long I'd say go somewhere else. If you are going, go with no expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",0
"The complete finest Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao) outside of China (perhaps even better than Hong Kong). The crab ones are really so tasty they melt in your mouth. Do not expect excellent service or cozy atmosphere. It is a restaurant in Chinatown, which means you go there for the food, not the setting. as soon as I lived in Hong Kong, this place was a must once I visited NYC to get my xiao long bao repair!",0
"The food looks better than some other Chinese restaurant I'm Chinatown. The beef Sichuan had medium amount of paper which was good for my taste. The pick probably not the best choice for a shanghai style restaurant. Usual folks try soup dumpling which is their signature dish,  but it does not have enough variety. Also 15 percent tip is already added to your bull.
 Downsides, small space,  decor is way old and rusty, only cash accepted. Servers do not attend regularly only when you ask them, basically looks like there is no assigned server for any table like some low key Asian restaurant.",0
"The soup dumplings are pretty good. I went there ~1pm on a Sunday and waited less than 10 minutes. Service was fast. The place was packed and the guy at the next table kept on bumping into me. 

Overall the xai long bao (soup dumplings) were really yum, the scallions pancakes were greasy and crispy, and the fried long flat noodles (pork) were alright.",0
environment is poor. arrived at 3pm but still be request to share a table with others. some tables are empty but not to open for us. XLB is not traditional. Too big and hard skin. Ordered spicy fish and chicken bone. Totally not Chinese food.  Using same sauce in these different cuisine. The waiter said they serve for foreigners. Okay. Definitely will not come back.,0
"Don't know what's the big deal with this place.  Had to wait 45 minutes to sit.  Their bathroom is an absolute war zone.  It's so disgusting.  One of my requirements for a restaurant is to have. Spotless bathroom.   This place was so dirty I felt like I had to go disinfect my whole body.  The soup dumplings everyone raves about were so whatever.  The Chinese food we ordered was a little on the pricier side of other establishments in Chinatown.  When it came to pay the bill, I didn't realize it was cash only and pulled out a cc.  They ran over like a swarm of bees and started yelling cSh only cash only.   Gottttttt it buddy.  Heard you the first time.  They were swarming around us like cockroaches.  Prolly cuz they have many cockroaches in the kitchen.  It is so dirty in there. When I was leaving.  The waiter started saying something directly to my face in passing.  Grrrrrr. I know what you said",0
Beijing duck disgustingIt's not Beijing duck! They even use Mexico wrap...Other food tastes so so.,0
"Just so you know this is a family style restaurant so you're sitting at a large round table with a bunch of people you don't know. In my case 5 other people that did not speak English which made for an interesting dynamic. 

This place seems constantly busy so make sure you have plenty of time and plan on a wait.

The Pork Buns seem to be the appetizer/meal of choice here. I did not much care for them not that they were bad just a texture issue. However, the 5 other people at my table ate 4 orders (32) of them so take that for what you will.

The Kung Pao Chicken was bland and just tasted like bell pepper not much flavor at all.

Then since this was my first time in Chinatown I went with a true safe pick Sesame Pick. It was delicious something I would definitely eat again.",0
"Not worth the wait and hype. Soup dumplings are fine but you get more of the same almost anywhere else (or better) with better environment, service attitude - waiting to eat here on a weekend night is like standing in line at Boba Guys on opening night for 3 hours: not worth.",0
"They require cash only, but they charge us with tax. And the service is horrible!! I don't think the price matches my experience.",0
"This place had a lot of hype. Maybe it was too hyped up for me. I wasn't impressed. 

What the reviews say is true. You get to sit next to strangers. They try to pack as much people as possible. I think that's cool. It's better than waiting in lines. Just ignore your table-mates like I did if you're anti-social.

Anyway, I tried their crab and pork soup dumplings, pork soup dumplings, and their seafood noodle soup. 

Their seafood noodle soup was bland and terrible. Honestly, with the excellent noodle soup places in NYC (eg. ramen and soba), there is no reason to get it here at Joe's Shanghai. The noodles tasted like it came straight out of a bag, and the broth was tasteless and tepid. 

Their soup dumplings tasted okay. The soup needed more flavor. It also tasted too fatty. The meat needed more umph to the flavor. It wasn't a bad soup dumpling, but I expected better.

This place is cash only, but it's cheap. Their service is lightning fast and efficient. They're not the friendliest of bunch, but they're polite and fast. I like that. 

I would advise you to ignore the hype and save yourself the trouble. I would avoid this place. 2.5 stars.",0
"The old location was great, but at this new location the quality of the dumplings has gone down a bit. It feels much more catered towards tourists and they're just coasting on the reputation they built up 

There are much better dumpling places around",0
This place is way over-hyped than it needs to be. Gets very crowded and you have to share tables with strangers. Soup dumplings are cheap but not too flavorful. I got crab and pork but they didn't taste like crab at all. Scallion pancake is ok but nothing special.,0
"Seriously? If you enjoy waiting forever to eat at a place that's packed with tourists because of a Zagat write-up, then you'll love this place. Never mind that their dumplings are not that much better than most other places in Chinatown or Flushing. I've eaten here twice because of friends, and the best thing about this place is seeing the tourists scramble back onto the sidewalk to avoid getting hit by cars on narrow Pell Street.

Too harsh?",0
"I decided to check this place out because everyone I know totally RAVES about this place and claims it is the best soup dumplings they have ever had. I come from California..where there it is very easy to find legit (& cheap) chinese food on every block. I got to admit, this place did not live up to the hype. I believe Kung Fu Ramen (49th & 8th) makes better soup dumplings than this place.

Pros:
--You get seated really fast! We had a huge group of 7 ppl and only had to wait 5 minutes.

Cons:
--it has a B rating. uhh..what kind of sketchy stuff is going on in the back that prevents it from getting that A?!
--Sesame chicken tastes like large orange chicken panda express and the broccoli that comes with it was raw
--***ADD $2 TO EVERYTHING ON THE MENU LISTED BY YELP!!!** i was totally expecting a different price than what was actually listed there
--be prepared to meet new people because you WILL be seated next to other groups of 2-3! (Though it is a very efficient way of cramming so many ppl into such a small place)

Is it bad? No, not necessarily. Would I come again? Ehh....debatable. I believe there are better places in the area.",0
"Their Soup dumplings are expensive and way overrated. They carry that zagat review as if they are the end all be all of Chinatown. It's fine by me. Tourists seem to LOVE this restaurant and I avoid is at all costs. Tourists have little experience with soup dumplings and likely chinese food that doesn't come in the fast food form and thus don't know any better. Like I said, very over rated for their price but I'm fine with it as long as tourists don't clog up the other restaurants!",0
Joes Shanghai is a great Asian restaurant if you like American- Chinese food. It's not very authentic and the flavors are not as strong as I am use to with the authentic Chinese take out. But overall it's a good place to start if your wanting to try Chinese cuisine!,0
"I'll start off by saying this location looks a lot fancier than the other location. I love the pork dumplings and all of its soupy glory. I would say they are Joe's Shanghai's best dish and the only thing I will ever get from here. It's nice and hot which makes it perfect for a cold day but it still tastes delicious when the weather is warmer, it's worth overheating for in the hot restaurant. I tried the cold noodles and it was way too peanut buttery; it literally tasted like noodles mixed with just peanut butter you get from jars. The service is definitely not attentive and is barely even there (which is probably why all checks automatically have 15% gratuity added). Everything with the exception of the soup dumplings was not my cup of tea.",0
"The soup dumplings here are okay. I was too hyped for this place. 
When you get there walk into the restaurant and get a ticket from up front. There is no space to wait inside, so you have to go outside until your number is called. They have a crazy disorganized way to get people seated. Workers come out and ask for your number. Then you have to shout it out in hopes she puts your number on her list. After all this chaos, you get seated in their packed restaurant. Don't expect to be seated at a table with just your party because you will share tables with strangers- I guess an interesting experience. 
Then the waiter comes and ask for your order. We ordered their soup dumpling and fried rice, but we ended up never getting our fried rice. Sigh... 
Soup dumplings are okay. They have a lot of flavor, but their wrappings were slightly too hard. They didn't taste as fresh as they could be. 
We asked for a cup of water multiple times, but never got them:( 
I was pretty happy to leave the hectic place after a while. 
Are the soup dumpling really worth the long cold wait outside? Are they really worth the chaos you have to endure for them?? Mmmmm... They weren't for me....",0
"Soup dumplings are great here but it is not worth the hype.

My family and I decided to try this place out after it was all over social media but we were a little disappointed. 

Staff is not friendly at all.. and they tend to throw the dishes/food at you.

There are way better and nicer place in NYC for soup dumplings.",0
"This is a very overrated place. The restaurant smells and the food is not fresh at all. If you come here, just order soup dumpling and nothing else. Even the soup dumplings here I had much better version of it somewhere else. The wrap of the soup dumplings here very thick and it was a bit salty.",0
I didn't enjoy the food.  It wasn't satisfying for me.  The food was bland and covered in heavy thick sauce.  The service was good so 3 stars otherwise it'd be 2 stars.,0
"Average, expected so much more and everything had the potential to be so good! Ordered the general's chicken and it was pretty much breading. Scallion pancakes were so thick and douhghy. Pork dumplings and bok Choy were good. Complimentary oranges at the end were nice and sweet.",0
"My friend and I were in the neighborhood and craving some Chinese food.  Yelp led me to this place.  We had an average experience, not bad but not great.  The first thing you notice is the organized chaos of the restaurant.  You are quickly ushered through a maze of waiters and tables until you are squeezed into the empty seats at a large circular table with strangers.  This is New York after all, so this seating arrangement was slightly awkward because nobody wanted to make conversation.  The waiters are on top of their game.  We had barely looked at the menu when we were asked for our order and our entrées arrived shortly after.  This is a positive and a negative.  I felt as if I was being rushed.

We ordered the pork dumplings which were a godsend.  Having been in Europe for six weeks where good Asian food is hard to come by, these juicy dumplings seemed like a tiny miracle.  It is apparent that dumplings are Joe's Shanghai's specialty.  I then ordered the chicken and shrimp in plum sauce.  It was mediocre.  My friend ordered the Singapore Noodles which were also mediocre.

If I come again I will probably only get an order of dumplings which only cost $4-5.  Be prepared for the chaos.  This is certainly not a place to bring a date or have an intimate conversation.",0
got the soup dumplings to take out - i do not recommend taking out soup dumplings,0
"You come here bc you don't know pork dumpling soup from the waiter's elbow.
You come here bc you want to introduce your non Asian bf to Chinese food.
You come here bc you're Asian and want to be ironically surrounded by non Asians in Chinatown.
You come here bc it's dirt cheap.",0
"Honestly I was pretty underwhelmed. Maybe it's because I've been spoiled living in SF and Seattle, but at the end of the day I wasn't that impressed. Also, the large communal tables with a ton of randos just wasn't my jam. Oh well!",0
"3.5 stars. I finally visited Joe's after avoiding it for some time for fear of it being over-hyped. My verdict? They do serve some really solid soup dumplings, but not necessarily worth such a long wait. I've eaten similar soup dumplings in California in restaurants with absolutely no wait. 

Also, I'm not sure if it's just me or I'm going crazy, but for some reason I find the dumpling skin at all the XLB places in NYC to be a bit too thick. And Joe's was no exception.

They did have a great soup, and were generally quite good. However, the crab soup dumplings weren't very good - definitely just stick with pork.",0
"Bad service. They know that 15% tip will be added automatically on the bill so they dont care about costumer service,never smile never say thank you.",0
"I realize I may be Yelp crucified once the soup dumpling experts get ahold of this review...I've had better. They were good, but I've had better.....(luv u Nom Wah) Pork dumplings 8 for $9, good broth but a little more fatty than I would've liked. (Pork and the pork with crab combo are the only dumpling fillings available). My boyfriend had white fish in white wine sauce with fungi and a side of steamed white rice. (See pic) Simple but delicious. 

I really appreciate the ambiance here. Kinda feels like someone's dining room. Home-y, family style and you even sit with strangers if there aren't enough of you for a large table. My boyfriend and I sat with 4 men who were already well into their meal. To our surprise, not awkward. Everybody just rolls with it. Complimentary tea throughout your meal (loved it, next time I'll ask what kind it is) and orange slices at the end of your meal. It was pretty good. Not spectacular as it is painted but solid. Give them a try. I'll return for other stuff & report back! 

Oh! CASH ONLY",0
"The food is okay, pretty oily. Not worth of the price. That's why I didn't see any Asian dining here. Also, the charge 15% of tips with check came in. I mean... They spilled water all over my pants... NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Sucks.",0
Extremely disrespectful waiters and staff. The food was average. Chinatown has several other better eateries so please take your business elsewhere.,0
"We stopped in and had the crab meat with pork dumplings after our next door table's ecstatic recommendation. They were okay, but what we really enjoyed was their Scallion Pancake with dipping sauce. We also shared the Seafood Flat Noodle, which was tasty. The joint was packed, which is great for the owners, but we found ourselves too tightly stuffed in, so we got out as soon as we could.",0
noodles are GROSS. Only dumplings are ok.. I'd never come back here . :( Bad service. This place is all about the hype. Customers are all tourists (who only depend on Yelp reviews) .I'd not recommend this place to anyone.,0
"The wait on a Sunday night was unusually short, roughly in line with others. I don't think it would've been worth it.
Interior: Bright and clean, not too crowded. Bathroom was nice except for a very dirty stall. Utensils were clean.
Food: Good overall. Some dishes had generous portions, others not so much.
Service: Slow and highly variable. Long waits between plates.
Prices: Pretty cheap, closer to $ than $$. 15% service charge and taxes are included. Cash only.
It was not a bad meal, but the experience did not justify the popularity of the restaurant. You can do better elsewhere.",0
"This place is wayyy overhyped and definitely a ""tourist trap"". 

First of all, let me start by saying- I don't mind waiting in line for awhile for good food.... but! This place has a totally messed up system. The tables here are communal, so I understand that sometimes a 3 person spot may open and jump ahead of the two, but they completely skipped our group and then when we asked they basically just said ""oops."" 

Second. I know this place is busy, but the customer service is subpar. They rush you through your order and seem frustrated if you ask questions. 

They are known for their dumplings - they only have two kinds. They're just okay. We tried both (pork and a pork+crab) and I honestly couldn't tell you which was which. We also had the scallion pancake which was oily and lacked flavor unless you put a lot of sauce on it. 

Dumplings came out quick. There's the one positive. 

There are sooooo many other places to get good food in Chinatown that I wouldn't waste your time on this one.",0
Date number two.  This time it is dinner for Shanghainese pork xiao long bao.  This restaurant has a high table turnover rate and it is extremely loud flooded with the constant Chinese chatter conversations.  Unfortunately my constant sneezing and nose running all day throughout the night I was unable to fully enjoy my date or dinner.  We also ordered Shrimp Pan fried noodles 虾 炒 面 which was swimming with MSG and too much oily sauce.  We shared a table with another party unable to have our individual table as it were Yum Cha style due to lack of space.  This restaurant is very popular for Lo Fans who are inexperienced with authentic Chinese food especially Shanghainese.  The xiao long bao are on point in true Shanghainese ethnic.  I can consume xiao long bao as if it were a full fledged meal.  We both enjoyed the soup dumplings as they are a Shanghainese staple and necessity.  Extremely loud restaurant as you cannot hear yourself think.  Dinner time is very crowded and it is extremely inaudible for couples or families to engage in intense physiological conversations with my date.  Waiter service is below average. My date is very dry monochromatic who exhibit signs of great selfishness and apathetic.,0
"I know this place is famous and everyone and their half-brother's nanny's girlfriend is raving about how great their soup dumpling is, and if you ever go to New York you have to make this an obligatory stop if you even considers yourself a foodie.  So it was added to our long lists of places to dine at weeks before we even left to go to New York for our culinary adventure.

But after checking out the highly rated pizza and hot dog joints (I really like Gray's Papaya), and also the fantastic Katz's Delicatessenin the preious days of our visit, we finally made our way to Joe's.  Got lost briefly after coming out of the subway, and had to ask around, but eventually we arrived at a decidedly aged but still very famous restaurant.  

The wait for us wasn't long, and we quickly ordered our food.  We were there to only try their famous soup dumplings, so we didn't really have to debate what else to order like we usually do.  And this review is for the crab meat and pork meat soup dumplings only, since we didn't try anything else.

So after a brief wait, our steaming hot dumpling of legend arrived.  We all took several pictures, trying to capture the whispy steam along with the moist parcel of soupy pork dumpling before gingerly picking it up with our chopsticks and succeeded in not puncturing it and letting the broth run out.

My initial reaction to the crab meat soup dumpling was that it was really salty, and I can't really taste much of the crab flavor.  The original pork meat ones was better, but it did not knock my socks off.  Maybe it was the high expectations and all the hype leading up to the final tasting, but it was just okay.  In fact, I have had better in California at a ""no-name"" restaurant, and really superb ones at Din Tai Feng in Taipei, Taiwan.  To Joe's Shanghai's credit, when I picked up my dumpling from the top, I can see the sag on the bottom of my dumpling indicating a lot of juicy broth is encased inside (my mom taught me that trick).

The reviews from my friends were also about the same, the original soup dumpling is better than the crab meat soup dumpling.  The great thing about our visit was that we were all able to check off Joe's Shanghai from our foodie's bucket list.

Also, we never made it to Dumpling Man while it was still opened during our trip, so I can't say which of these two restaurants' dumplings is better.",0
The food was good but not excellent and very pricy. The service personel seemed uninspired to say the least. There must other restaurangs in that area of Chinatown where the money is more well spent.,0
Good soupy dumplings. I tried both pork and the mixed pork and crab. Dough part of the dumpling was thicker than what I had at Din Tai Fung in Seattle and LA. Prefer the thinner and denser shell at Din Tai Fung.,0
"soup dumplings are fine, scratches the itch.

I moved away from New York City four years ago.  I am back for a visit and went to Joe's Shanghai for the used-to-be superb crab soup dumplings.  i was shocked.  instead of the rich crab soup the dumpling contained soup that didn't even taste like crab or maybe just barely.  Was the place sold and the new owner is cutting corners?  It is a mystery to me how they could take the goldmine of a deservedly world reknown signature dish and monkey with the recipe.  I had gone there for years and will never go back.,0
"Overall: Not really worth the hype or the wait but if you aren't willing to go to flushing, probably your best bet

Found this place on social media - its pretty popular on YouTube, Tik Tok, and Instagram so there's always a very long wait (Saturday lunch time was about 1 hour). I would say all around was not the best and did not really live up to the hype. For the soup dumplings, the inside should be soupy and broth like - here it was so heavy and oily - it tasted almost like they put vegetable oil in it. The meat inside and the outer dough was very delicious though. We also got a few veggies and dim sum platters which were hit or miss. For the price, it was pretty cheap and the review may seem harsh but I had high expectations for the place with all of the hype and the history. I will say that in Chinatown, Joes Shanghai may be the best soup dumplings you can find but it doesn't really come close to the famous/classic soup dumpling places in Flushing. For me, instead of waiting 60 minutes in line, I would just take the train 40 min to flushing. But if you aren't willing to take the trek, Joes is probably your best bet and its really not that bad considering the price point - it just could be better. Also they are cash only so bring cash!",0
"So, came to Joe's Shanghai after many years, remembering tasty soup dumplings and having a craving after work.  Of course there was a wait, and of course there were tourists lined up outside, but we nevertheless put our names on the list.  To pass the thirty minutes, we walked around the vicinity to find a place to have a beer--an exercise in futility.  

When we were finally seated, we made light conversation with our tablemates, who were enthusiastically scarfing down their meals.  We ordered pork soup dumplings and crab soup dumplings, crispy shredded beef, and seafood with rice cakes.  My friend said that for a Shanghainese place, they sure have a lot of Szechuan options.  The soup dumplings came out fresh and piping hot, but for some reason, the pork soup was bland to me.  The crab dumplings were pretty good, the soup was tastier than the pork, but all in all, the dumplings were a bit underwhelming.  And that is only because all the rave reviews set the bar a bit too high.  They were acceptable dumplings, but not stellar.  I have had more delicious soup dumplings at dim sum in the outer boroughs.

The other two dishes were what you would expect from a take out joint.  They were pretty greasy, salty and lacking in protein.  The beef was dredged or battered, and fried, and then covered in a sticky, sweet sauce, similar to General Tso's style, which I avoid.  It was definitely junk food.  The seafood dish had a bit of seafood and was mostly rice cake.  I found the squid and shrimp pretty chewy, not very appetizing.

I won't remark on the service as many before have noted that after you wait, you're rushed in, order right away and get the check as soon as you drop your chopsticks, but that's fine with me.  They also add their service charge to your bill so you won't have to do any math, although it's just the minimum for their ""bare bones"" service.

If I were to return, which I don't believe I would, unless it were to the Flushing location, I would stick to the dumplings and perhaps steamed items.  But really, there are so many authentic, outstanding, no-wait places waiting to be tried that it seems silly to return.",0
"I love the xiao long bao here but the service really kills my mood. The servers are extremely rude at times. The Joe's Shanghai in Flushing is much better! The food tastes the same, and the atmosphere is more relaxed compared to the one in Chinatown.",0
"I was so excited to try this place after friends have raved about it.  After trying the pork and crab dumplings, I was pretty disappointed.  Maybe I just had high expectations, but with as many reviews as this place got, I expected better.  Oh well, I guess I gotta go to Shanghai one day.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is the first place I ate in New York, and I don't know what the attraction is.  It's similar to some place I ate at in Philadelphia - the blonde wood, the menu, the lay-out, the restrooms downstairs. It looked like everyone was enjoying their food, and the servers are busy and efficient.  But the food itself just isn't that impressive.  

I've only had soup dumplings one other time, at that place in Philly, so that's my comparison. Joe's pork soup dumplings are good, but not great.  They're big, so big that you can't eat them whole, and when you bite into them, broth squirts across the table. The dough is chewy; I seem to prefer the lighter doughs.  And the broth seems a bit congealed, with lumps of something or other. I also tried a scallion pancake.  Again, it was good, but there was barely the hint of onion. Nothing worth a special trip or anything.

It's worth noting that they don't take credit cards, so you have to make sure to add up everything on the menu before ordering if you normally don't carry large amounts of cash around with you. That's a little annoying, and if you only have a twenty it might preclude something like the crab and pork dumplings.  It's nice that they give you hot tea, but odd that they give it to you in a glass instead of a cup (some ice and sweetener would turn it into some decent iced tea).  

They also add a 15% service charge to the bill, so there's no need to tip.  I don't know if that's good or bad, because I usually tip 20% and it kind of cheats the servers out of that other 5%, but it's what they do.

This might well be the best restaurant in New York's Chinatown, and the best soup dumplings in New York - I would have no clue. But next time I'll try to try somewhere else.",0
"I went to Joe's on a Holiday Monday right at opening. I did not have to wait. Service was quick. My husband and I ordered the pork soup dumplings, sesame chicken, and beef pan fried noodles. The pork dumpling was good but not great. It needed some salt and the texture of the pork was different than I've tried. The actual dumpling was good and there was enough soup inside. The sesame chicken was crispy and sweet. The beef pan fried noodles were very good as well. The beef was not overcooked. The noodles were soft and crunchy.  

The inside was big. Some of the tables were close to each other. 

Would I come back? Maybe for different entrees but not the soup dumplings.

CASH ONLY!",0
"Horrible service, the dumplings are good the rice sucks. No duck sauce and no fortune cookies. Servers look like they hate life.",0
"The soup dumpling is definitely a 4 star.  However, other dishes are 2 stars.  Stick to the famous dumplings, but skip other traditional Shanghai dishes like drunken chicken (it was dry and flavorless).  If you only want the dumplings, this is a good place.  If you want the various traditional Shanghai food, this is not the place to go.",0
"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said already?

Not much. Might as well emphasize the important points.

Waiters here are quick and efficient... they're always busy but the only long wait is to get a table cuz there's always a million people ahead of you. Once you're seated, you get your food quick. Don't let those soup dumplings sit for long... they're terrible once they get cold.

Joe's Ginger is only a few steps away, less crowded... but I like this place better. Maybe for the same reason the original 53rd and 6th halal truck is crazy popular while the one across the street is only a fraction of the wait. I mean, it's only human nature to want what you can't have.

Note that it's cash only and tip is included.",0
"Tried this place because of the reviews. It was okay. Nothing so would come back for again though. Expect that they will seat you on a table with other people no matter how small your party is and there are smaller tables open. We were told they always full the bigger tables... 

The food was okay. If I was to recommend anything it would the the crab and pork dumpling soup. Everything else was ‍",0
"What happened Joe Shanghai? This place was delicious in the past but right now I feel like it's greasy chinese food. My crab meat soup dumplings came out cold and it's not as flavorful as it used to be. I prefer my options in Flushing now. My chicken lo mein was VERY OILY and you might as well rename it and called it veggie noodles with extra oil as a topping. I was having trouble finding the chicken pieces.

I bumpped into an old friend and decided to have lunch here but now I know to steer clear from this place next time we have a reunion.",0
"Soup dumplings were so delicious! Wish we ordered 2 orders. Also ordered crispy pork chops and beef fried rice, both were just okay.
The workers are not so nice, a lady at our table (you sit with strangers) ordered one thing, but the waitor said she ordered another, and he wouldn't budge. He was actually very rude to her, so unprofessional and makes me not like them much.",0
Food is not as good as I think. Sweet and sour beef barely have meat inside. Kitchen looks hella dirty. Worst customer service ever. My brother has to drop off my family and go find a parking since it was raining. They refuse to let my family to be seated and have to wait outside in the rain until everyone is present.,0
It's not that amazing . It's good but same as many other soupy dumplings I've had. Prices are reasonable but the place looks very dirty. They wee very crowded they make money they should renovate the place !,0
"Expect communal tables and a long wait. There is another Joe Shanghai in midtown that has shorter wait times. The juicy buns are good, but there are other hidden gems in Chinatown that have comparable juicy buns. The other dishes here are OK - I wouldn't recommend them.",0
"They were great, then they were good, now they are ok/good. The customer service isn't the best, its pretty much ""you get what you get"" and sometimes that's hit or miss. I've begun to go elsewhere for my soup dumplings these days...",0
"Place is $ cash only. One round of pork dumplings,  one round of crab dumplings, and a fried pancake, total of $22.15 after tax, before tip. 

Pork dumplings are no better, or worse than other dumpling houses near by, same goes for the fried pancake. We went on a Friday before closing (didn't have to wait to be seated, but me and my wife shared a table w/ others). It was pretty busy even as we left at 11pm. Typical Chinatown service.",0
"Came here because of the great YELP reviews. However, I was very disappointed. They do not take credit cards and the food was very bland. The service was not great, nor friendly. With all the other restaurants nearby, I would definitely NOT recommend this one.",0
"i seriously don't get why this place gets the hype. the soup dumplings are pretty flavorless compared to others in the city- even grand sichuan on st marks has better ones, or shanghai asian manor around the corner completely kills it. the only thing you can taste is the salt.

scallion pancakes are a grease soaked, flaccid mess. not crispy, not particularly scallion flavored, and doughy. 

avoid this tourist trap.",0
"I'll try it because the store's comments are very 
good But the truth is quite the opposite. I even think the store has made a fake comment! Not only are people super many, but each table also has to dine with different guests! Can you imagine a table with four groups of customers? I don't recommend going to the restaurant very much. I don't think I'll be able to go any more.",0
Joe's Shanghai is over hyped!! We order their special pork dumplings and was a little disappointed the fillings has curry.  The long string was was overpriced $15!  Scallion pancakes was good with a very centered!   This place was  just OK....   Yank Sing in San Francisco got Joe's Shanghai beats by 1000%.... the BEST and delicious dim sum of all!!!,0
This Joe's is not as good as the one in Flushing. This one is bit greasier and definitely more cramped. Still good food but not as good as the original. Very greasy rice cakes and scallion pancakes,0
"Okay so over the years i have definitely experienced better soup dumplings. The chinatown location is mayhem! My friend and I ended up sharing a table with two other parties and it was definitely cramped. There was barely enough room to put the food down! I was afraid that the staff will spill dumplings, sauces and anything in between on me. I was super stressed out the whole time. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to eat and talk this will not be the place. You will be eating and hustled out!

The quality of the dumplings were also not up to their usual standards. It looked as if they didn't even try to place the dumplings apart so they won't stick. Some of the dumplings were open at the top so just imagine the disappointment when you pick one up only to realize all the soup is gone!

If you're in the area for soup dumplings there are better ones around chinatown with less of a crowd and a better experience! Don't just eat here for the name it's americanized and not as good as it use to be.",0
"Sorry Joe, our date didn't go well. Maybe I expected too much from you since you are so popular for your soup dumplings. The displayed articles about you on the store window were quite impressive. You seem to be known in Japan and even somewhere in Europe. 

BUT, after waiting 30+ min with only god knows how you count your numbers with those tickets and quite unpleasant hostess who kept saying - I heard you and your number is not up yet - several times when trying to check if my number was called - I was already wanted to go home. 

Finally we sat in a round table with a bunch of strangers, I could not locate your famous soup dumpling order in your menu. We just guessed and ordered with some sauted seasonal vegetables.

Maybe our conversation during dinner was too intense to notice your dumplings but, it was all sloppy and broken even before we picked up from the steam tray. Heh? S**t. What's the point eating broken soup dumplings? And ones that are not broken, weren't even hot enough. 
The sauted chinese bokchoy was too soggy and lifeless.

Please Joe, maybe you became too comfortable with your fame since you got too popular. I won't call it conceit, tho. But, I am afraid to tell you that I won't return your call for our next date. I found better somewhere. Good luck!",0
"Outstanding  dumplings that has the soup inside.  Caution, very hot!!!  If you eat it like a vampire (ie...suck out the juice) then you'll have a good experience.  We got two different orders, but the crab and pork were the best.  I think this is the tasting best dish and best value at this place.  The other dishes: Fried Pork Chop and noodle dish were just okay.

NOTE:  we saw a lot of young non-Asian types.  My guess is that most of the crowd just followed the Yelp reviews just like us.  Note to self:  when you don't see a lot of old Chinese folks in a restaurant in Chinatown, best to look elsewhere.",0
"Compare to the average Chinese food in SoCal, this place is close enough if they lower about 50% percent of the price tag. The dumpling is about average, nothing special. No where near Ding-Tai Fong as other reviewer mentioned. We waited for about 30 mins for early dinner ( 5PM). I'm not sure why new yorker can't find a better Chinese place to go, maybe it's a tourist place after all.

Stick with dumpling( steam or fired), the other dishes is below average, crispy duck is bland and  tasteless, stir fry veggie dish are way over priced, try somewhere else if you can...",0
"After a failed attempt at dim sum (more on that in another review), we ended up here because my friend wanted dumplings and I suggested she try xiao long bao. Searched across Yelp for places with soup dumplings in Chinatown and stumbled across this place...and the line. After about 30 to 40 minutes, we were seated at a large table with 4 other parties. (It's okay though. It's New York. You're lucky you have a place to sit in a restaurant at this price range.) 

Food was better than decent and the service was great. We ordered Shanghai fried noodles (they were okay), garlic eggplant (tasty but extremely sweet), a green onion pancake (good but greasy), and she, a basket of pork XLB. They were more than accommodating when I asked for no pork in the two normally pork-laden dishes--I'm vegetarian. My friend liked this place so much, we actually repeated the trip a week later and stood in an even longer line. That said, I'm sure you can probably get better XLB and Chinese food in NYC. But until I discover that place, this will do.",0
"First things first, this is just average soup dumpling.
I don't understand why people hype it so much, because to me, this is just a little better than the frozen soup dumpling.

I got the scallion pancake, lo mein, and 2 stacks of soup dumplings. All tasted fine, but I guess I just have high expectations for the hyped restaurants where some places meet or exceed my expectation and some place just disappoints. And this would be one of the one that didn't meet my expectation.",0
"The xiao long bao is really the only thing you should get here, and maybe the nian gao. Definitely one of the best xiao long bao I've had, dare I say as good as ones in Shanghai? As good as that was, I was so confused by the dumplings here. The skin was so thick and chewy, and the filling was not even that good. Those were so disappointing that we didn't even finish them.

"Meh.  Struck me as tourist-trappy.  Wife and I went because of the good reviews here on Yelp.  Waited about 30 minutes on  Friday evening around 7 pm.  Super crowded, you sit wherever they can cram you in, sitting with strangers (not at all a place to go if you want to enjoy a meal with the person you came with).  Pork soup dumplings were very good.  Crispy beef entree was decent, but not worth $18.  Fried pork dumplings were really bland - tasted no ginger, and even with the accompanying sauce, very bland.  Ive hosetly had better at a Panda Express.  Overall, struck me as an overhyped place, good if you're wanting the ""hey, let's go meet strangers and share a communal meal with them at a famous restaurant"" experience, but otherwise, not worth the travel and the wait.",0
"You need to be psychologically prepared before coming here, otherwise you'll have a really shitty time.
1. Food is good, although as vegans we barely have any options. 
2. You will have to wait in line for about 20 minutes. Outside.
3. The place is small, you may share a table, and although it looks like it, you're luckily not sitting on each other's lab (or someone else's).
4. The service is the RUDEST you can possibly imagine. When we asked the hostess if we can switch table she yelled several times if we were ready to order. The waiter had the nicest attitude. No, not really, unless you consider throwing the plate in front of your face a nice way of serving people.
I get it, they want you to order quick, shovel the food into your mouth, pay and leave, but man, I'm still a human being and above all a paying customer. 
5. They have the audacity to include the tip already into your bill. I don't care why, but tip is given based on good service and this was worse than a German divey bar full of old, bitter, frustrated fisherman without a job.",0
"If anyone thinks this place has good soup dumplings is a sucker and probably a tourist.  Absolutely the worst experience.  Our soup dumplings were sloppily made, had no soup inside them, and sat on a bed of shriveled up cabbage that was so disgusting.  We got up and left.  Pile on top of that the overpriceing, the line out the door, and you have yourself a classic tourist trap.  Don't go here.",0
"actually 3.5 

- pros: good inexpensive meal, xiao long bao with pork and shrimp were great, 
sesame pancake was good.  

- cons: servers are hectic and not careful enough.. we ordered sesame pancake, waited for 30 minutes, and figured out that the server didn't even tell to the cook in the kitchen.. and lastly, CASH ONLY even if we had more than $20.. 

Came here for Friday lunch with my friend who had studied in China for a half year.
arrived here at around 12pm and we kinda worried about a long waiting, but we could get seated as we entered inside. most of the seats are big round tables for a party of 6~8ppl, so we had to share a table with a family of 5 ppl, and another mid-aged men.

Food was nice, compared to its cheap price. But do not expect nice and careful waiters/waitresses.. some of them can't even speak english very well.",0
"When it comes to the taste, this place is the best place for Xiaolongbao (tiny juicy bun with crab meat) in New York. If you want the best tasting xiaolongbao, go to this place.

There are a few things that will turn you down though:

1) There is a long line (sometime more than an hour)
2) Be ready to share the table with others. This is not where you can expect a cozy dining experience. Find a seat, eat, and leave.
3) Don't expect good service. Again, sit down, order, eat, pay, then leave. Don't expect anything extra.
4) Plates and utensils aren't very clean. Inspect them carefully. If you see anything, wet your napkin with hot tea to clean them.

Well, food is great here though.",0
"I went here with my bf expecting quick, cheap Chinese food (particularly dumplings).  I was a little bummed out, overall. The place felt touristy, although there were some non-tourist looking hipsters there.  Also, no Asian diners, a sign that Chinatown locals don't necessarily eat there.

The soup dumplings were really good, although they burned my mouth.  But they were hot and tasty and fun to eat.  The meat could have been a little more flavorful, but it passed.  We also had Shanghai noodles (meh) and a scallion pancake (pretty good, not too greasy).  We didn't touch the main entrées, because they were overpriced for Chinese food.

Overall, go for the dumplings.  They're like $5 for 8--great deal and delicious.",0

Garbage bins being carried near tables
No English communication

Poor staff - not even making an effort for service",0
"I know that when it comes to Chinese restaurants, you come for the food not the service but we got two waiters that were just nasty and rude. To make it all worse, the food was not that great. The soup dumplings looked sad and wilted, like a ball that's lost most of it's air and when it came time to sink my teeth into them there was barely anything there. Just a small amount of filling which left me wondering, where's the soup?!?!  The scallion pancakes, which should've been a no-brainer were thick and chewy and tasteless. 

I'd go back to Joe's but only if I had to, Shanghai Cafe on Mott St is so much better!",0
"Not as good as the hype. There are much better places for soup dumplings, especially in the last 5 years. Only tourists and nostalgia buffs should eat here.",0
This place is always good for the soup-filled pork dumplings. The long wait for a table and then the community table is less desirable.,0
"I was craving xiao long bao so figured we'd goto Joe's Shanghai after our haircut appointment (right across the street).

Joe's is an established name in NYC and is well-known for its soup dumplings.  What can go wrong, right?

Well, plenty, as it turns out.

First dish -- scallion pancakes -- put us off on a bad start immediately.  The pancakes were literally SWIMMING in oil.  Now I understand you need oil to fry things but... the excessive oil was scary and disgusting.   I used my paper napkin to pat it dry but in the end we could not make ourselves finish the dish.

We each ordered a basket of the soup dumplings.  This was the real test.  After all this was what Joe's was famous for!  

Sad to report, the xiao long bao here fails miserably on ALL fronts: 1) the skin was way too thick; 2) the taste was, well, not tasty at all; and 3) they over-cooked them so every bao turned out dry and shriveled up.

Oh the service sucked too.  I don't expect good service in Chinatown but this place takes the cake for having some of the rudest waiters.

Last but not least, not a big fan of sharing tables with strangers.  The 4 Caucasians sitting across from us kept staring while we ate.  Particularly annoying as they kept commenting on how good the food is when we know it's shit.  

I just don't understand WHY folks keep insisting this is the best xiao long bao place in NYC?!?

Lesson learned.  Craving soup dumplings?  Goto ""The Bao"".  So much better there.",0
"GREASY GREASY GREASY GREASY 

The only reason this spot got two stars is because of the soup dumplings, they are indeed tasty.  Besides the dumplings, we ordered the scallion pancakes, chicken with rice cakes and pork with crispy noodles.  

We were greased out after the dumplings and scallion pancakes and a few bites of the crispy noodles.  The MSG was overwhelming & it literally took 3 beers to finish the meal.  

To top it off the female host/seater was extremely rude.  However, the wait staff was extremely attentive and fast.  

Decor was drab and ""chinatown dirty"", meaning its only acceptable in Chinatown.  Feels almost like a tourist trap

I would only return for the soup dumplings",0
"Came to Joe's to see what all the hype was about and honestly it didn't amaze me. Food was great, ordered two varieties of soup dumplings which came out huge and extremely tasty. However, the staff at Joe's weren't the most welcoming. My friend and I sat near the register and constantly had people bumping into us since we shared a table with strangers. Yes I understand it's extremely busy and the waiters have to cater to everyone but the constant bumping into the chairs without apologies made this review go down to three stars. They also add a service fee charge that comes with the meal so it'll be good to read your receipt carefully. Overall, great food, horrible staff.",0
"Not really sure what the big deal is. Ridiculously long line, the food was sub-par and covered in too much sauce and MSG. Go to any of the other hole in the wall Chinese restaurants in the area. You will get a lot more bang for your buck.",0
"Absolutely disgusting!!!! The crab / porksoup dumplings was so greasy and the ground pork they used had such a foul smell on it and no taste of crab at all,On top of that They sat me near a garbage with a little curtain that covers it that the odor that came out of it was so horrendous .I complained so they end up putting me in a communal table where they were wiping and using a stinky rug while hurriedly taking out the other people's dishes beside me almost hitting my plates.It's not like they had no other tables there were plenty in the back.Sad to see such quality go down . Ate only 1 of eight soup dumplings I was served,  I simply got grossed out.",0
The waiter yelled at me for a bit but I'll forgive because the dumplings were really good 6stars !! Shrimp fried rice was amazing also !! But pan fried noddles were disappointing it was very chewy in the middle. costumer service was ok. Overall 3/5,0
"The food took too long and was not worth the wait. They did not take credit cards, which was a major inconvenience. The tables were way too packed together.",0
"The trouble started with the front door, when they were ready to seat our party and lead us inside, but then gave the table to another group.  At that point we should have walked out, it was an absolute cluster *uck in there.  The greeting staff were absolutely confused, like chickens with their heads cut off.  They really didn't know what they were doing.  I also noticed a sign stating that 15% gratuity would be added to ALL orders (not just large parties) ""for your convenience"", and we figured out why before we even sat down.  Before our jackets were off our waiter comes up to us and irately asks is if we want pork bun appetizers.  I know they want to turn their tables but this was just absurd.  They were breathing down our necks so they can get another group in.  

The service was as tek s. stated in an earlier review ""horrifically abysmal"" which I could forgive if the food was any good.

The Shanghai buns were mediocre at best.  They had a very mass produced taste and feel to them.  Most of the issues with the dumplings is textural I suspect because they have been previously frozen.  The wrapper was thick and gummy, the filling was a bit dry and tough, and the soup was pretty good but too fatty.  A good xiaolongbao should have a thin chewy wrapper,  tender pork and a velvety soup.  The other dish we got, chicken pan fried noodles was just bizzare.  Cellophane noodles which just acted like a sponge to the noodles.  The chicken was okay but that's all.  

All this seems par for the course for this place.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I don't understand why they get rave reviews, the Joe's in flushing is much better.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is a huge tourist trap. Their soup dumplings are fine, but nothing to write home about except for the over an hour wait only to be crammed into a table for 4 with 2 people already sitting there and the God awful service. They bark at you to order and then pray. No thanks. There are better soup dumplings in Manhattan.",0
"I'm Chinese and eat Shanghai food every month and I don't understand how this restaurant even get 4 stars.
The soup dumplings was horrible the meat inside is marinated with too much soy sauce. It should not taste like this!!",0

the soup dumplings are way too greasy, heavy and meaty.  want the best soup dumplings?  din tai fung in arcadia, ca (near LA).   the 2 stars are for the green onion pancake.  they're thick and fluffy.  yummy!  everything else is just like any other of the 3245t43245643 chinese restaurants out there.",0
"Cash only.

The ""prawns"" dish- their signature citrus prawns were standard U12 shrimp.  They obviously have no idea what a prawn is. I do appreciate the dish came with broccoli.

The noodles were ok, didn't blow my mind but had a nice wok flavor.

The dumplings were grease filled rice paper morsels that really tasted like nothing other than grease.

Spring roll was good. $2.25 for one.

Overall damage was $50 on food that probably cost $5 to make.",0
"I went over here during the summer with some work colleagues. You know this place has been overated on yelp when more than 50% of the patrons in a restaurant in Chinatown are white. The line was huge. We waited around 30 minutes, only to share a table with a couple of girls. 

The soup dumplings weren't anything special or that much different from Shanghai Cafe's. So if you're looking for soup dumplings, head there. God knows the line should be much shorter, and it's probably cheaper too.

IIRC, I had no complaints with the service.",0
"TL;DR: Not worth the hype. Less than average soup dumplings and food. Make sure you bring cash, and expect at least a little bit of a wait

I have had soup dumplings several times, but every time, I was just following my group of friends/meeting at a place that other people picked. I never had a strong opinion until I had really good soup dumplings last time I was in NYC. So decided to give Joe's Shanghai a try, since it's so well known for soup dumplings/dim sum. 

Husband and I came here around 2PM on a Friday, and there was a decent amount of people waiting outside. They will give you a ticket and put your name down and come out and call when your table is ready. 

FOOD:

~Scallion Pancake (3/5): Had decent flavor and texture, but was incredibly oily and doughy. Not enough scallion spread throughout the pancake

~Hong Kong Style Hot and Sour Soup (2.5/5): More sour than hot, and very sour. Couldn't really taste anything else other than acidic flavor

~Pork Soup Dumplings (2/5): They are a decent size. At first I thought the soup was flavorful, but realized it was just incredibly salty. There is a decent amount of meat filling in it. The dumpling dough had a stale quality to it. 

Overall, the entire experience was very disappointing.",0
It was meh. If the line is longer than a 10 minute wait- not worth it. There are other places in the city that are worth going to if you're not a tourist (or an advanced tourist).,0
"Joe's Shanghai makes a pretty good soup dumpling. The last time I was there, we ordered the pork soup dumplings and the crab and pork soup dumplings. The dumplings came out perfectly, each a little delicious pocket of meat and soup. 

If you're set on coming here for soup dumplings, I would go early to avoid the crowds. If you're pretty flexible, there's plenty of other shanghai restaurants right on the same block.",0
The crab dumplings were very good but the beef soup noodles were a bit on the spicy side. The scallion pancakes were a bit bland but the crunch factor was great. The young chow fried rice was on the salty side but the rice cakes was decent,0
"Why's this place so well-known? Their dumplings were just disgustingly greasy.  Literally, the soup was just... grease.The filling looked and tasted like MSG-covered chorizo. It's a dumpling made of burrito drippings!

If this is what good Chinese dumplings taste like, maybe I'll stick to my crappy, American-friendly dumpings. If only Panda Express had dumplings...",0
"This place does not deserve 4 stars.  I will never understand why people are waiting outside of this place, although that's exactly why I wanted to try it on a weekday afternoon.  Complete waste of money and room in my stomach.  We ordered cold sesame noodles and black mushrooms with bamboo shoots.  The cold sesame noodles were so disgusting, we couldn't make ourselves eat them.  If the staff hadn't seemed so rude (except for the very friendly lady at the front who finds you a table) I would have tried to talk to them about not paying for the noodles.  It was like peanut butter on top of overcooked cheap spaghetti.  They didn't taste like sesame and they didn't taste like any noodles I had before anywhere - they dissolved into a thick glue substance in my mouth.  Maybe no one orders this dish and they found a pot of cooked noodles from last week laying around.  The mushroom dish was maybe a 2 or 3 star rating, but left a strong cornstarch taste in my mouth.  They didn't ask if we wanted rice (some places include it, some don't, but they usually suggest to order rice or ask you.  Our waiter said nothing to us the entire time).  The tea tasted weird.  And they charge you a tip automatically!  They also took our money before we were ready.  I would never ever go here again, when there are SO MANY restaurants in the area and even the so-so ones are 1 million times better than Joe's Shanghai.",0
"Joe's Shanghai = Eh!

I haven't been here in a while, and my husband never has, so I figured we go and have some much needed soup dumplings. It's been a long winter and I figured the warmth of the dumplings would be nice.

Wrong.

I know chinatown, and I know chinatown servers, but this place was just overpopulated w/ tourists and too-busy-to-help-you servers. I was overwhelmed. I'm not chinese, but I somewhat look it, so the constant bombardment of ""are you readys?"" was overwhelming. After trying to remember what I used to get, I just picked some random things (along w/ the pork soup dumplings) that sounded like it and was sadly disappointed. I wasn't that crazy about the flavor from the soup dumplings. My green beans were definitely the ""americanized version"". And everything else was just blah.

After eating everything, I actually remembered that my shanghainese bff brought me to some other places a long time ago that I actually liked better. Dummy me didn't ask him prior to my visit. Won't be back.",0
"I'd like to open by saying that this place is definitely overrated. The fact I waited on line pretty late on a Wednesday night when Shanghai Cafe is literally blocks away was a little ridiculous...that being said....

The scallion pancake is fantastic. Crunchy on the outside, delicate on the inside with a nice charred scallion flavor. As I've come to understand, the sauce to accompany is supposed to be a slightly sweet and salty ginger sauce. The sauce in general wasn't that tasty and didn't have any ginger. I could totally be wrong though. 

The soup dumplings...the dough is too thick, but magically, too tender at the same time. The only way to not loose the broth is to let them cool down quite a bit, but then the dough gets chewy. We all know how that goes. I would also venture to say that the entire filling and the broth is made from Pig's feet, which although is super delicious and unctuous, it's very funky and overpowering. You don't taste any of the other seasoning and it takes a ton of vinegar to balance the fattines, so you end up really overpowering any delicate flavors. 

Not bad, but there are better options in the area and definitely in Flushing. (Yes I know that's an hour away)",0
"This is the only soup dumplings place in NY I have been to, so I have nothing to compare this place to. Nonetheless, Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings are truly amazing. They are so juicy, meaty and rich in flavor! The pan fried noodles is quite good as well. 

Yet there are some complaints I have against this place. Firstly, I don't understand their mandatory 15% tip policy. Maybe it's because they get a lot of large group customers, but it's still annoying. Another thing is that they didn't fill the bottom of the dumpling case with enough cabbages the most recent time I visited, so many of the dumplings got stuck to the bottom and exploded when I tried to pick them up. Lastly, the wait can be ludicrously long, especially during weekends. There is no doubt this is one of the better places to dine at in Chinatown, but I don't think it's worth an hour long wait. For these reasons, I am withholding from giving this place more stars.",0
"I think this place is overrated. No credit card payment, cash only! 

It was overpriced for China town and the food was average for my taste.

The water spinach was $14??? Why, water spinach is super cheep at the Asian market and grow like weeds.

The shrimps and scallops $21 were OK, nothing special.

I'm sure there are plenty of good Chinese food and way more reasonable in China town than this.

Sorry Joe!",0
"I had high expectations for this restaurant based other's experiences.  In particular,  my companion had wonderful past experiences here so I was excited. However, my experience was a disappointing.  The quality of the was food okay as it did not taste any different than dishes at other Chinese restaurants at which I have dined. Thus, other than family style seating that works well for the restaurant, nothing set it apart as great.

The quality of the service can improve; while taking our order the waiter began a conversation with a co-worker, which I thought was rude.  In general the wait-staff seemed disinterested in the customers. Whether it is a cultural dynamic that I do not comprehend or not, the adage of when in Rome has value for any business. Later in the evening I went to the bathroom preceded by an employee.  The person was in the bathroom for quite a while and I did not hear water running for hand-washing prior to exit.

This is just my experience and I certainly do not wish to dissuade anyone from trying as it may be a wonderful for you.",0
"Service was great which is why they got the extra star but, their reign has been going on too long and the food was terrible. 

Too salty and over priced. We had 4 dishes and not a single one was good. Add two beer and final price was $86",0
"This place was alright. Tried it for the first time, and it was not like what I expected. Got the Lion's head, which was too sweet for my taste. The salt and pepper calamari taste good but not very crunchy. The green beans is what expected of a Chinese restaurant. The xiao long Bao was better than ones in Houston but not great. Over all, I would not go back here. It is more of a one time experience kind of thing.",0
"3 stars.

Service people were nice (at least if you spoke Chinese), food was okay, but not that great. Reminder: this place is cash only. 

We got the 小籠包 (xiao long bao) which was okay. The skin is a little thicker than usual, but they are larger size than typical.

We also got 四季豆牛肉絲 (shredded beef and bean sprouts) which I would maybe give a 4/5. Beef was tender, beans were good. We also got 炒年糕 (stir fried rice cake with beef) which was not good at all (2/5).

So overall a 3/5.",0
"We were there yesterday because seeing the high ratings on yelp. Got there. The food is way too much oil. Xlb is ok, not much special compared to the ding tai fung in Cali or Taiwan. Service is horrible and the restaurant look dirty.",0

Recommendations
*Don't eat here, eat at Shanghai Cafe (only a few blocks away) where the soup dumplings don't taste like lard/fat.  I felt slightly sick after eating this, and I'm CHINESE! Yes, Chinese food is suppose to be greasy, but this restaurant is definitely Americanized Chinese:/ 
*The crab soup dumplings were disgusting.  I had to try to convince my friend and myself to eat it, because we didn't want to waste food :/
*If you spill your soup in your plate you will notice that it hardens after a while, soup is NOT SUPPOSE TO HARDEN. Gross
*Shanghai noodles was probably the only redeeming item today, unfortunately :/",0
"I am completely shocked and perplexed as to how this place has a 4 star yelp status. I thought this place must be good as the first time I tried to get in there was a crowd of people outside (both Chinese and not). I say this because being Asian, we can nip out the good from the bad. There was also a 20 minute minimum waiting time. Homie don't play that...

So I got here another time where there was no wait. Weeeeee I was execited. 

Well, Joe's is the epitome of a tourist trap. I think 5 people must've said this place was really good, and the sheep of society followed because nothing about this place was extraordinary. 

Once inside, if you're not with a large party, expect to sit at a table with a bunch of strangers. Ok, that's fine but now I guess my party and I will order less to accommodate room for other people's food at our table. Service was rushed and they never came back to check if we were good, wanted water, or were still alive at the minimum.  Total dumpling sweatshop factory. 

While I agree the soup dumplings are exceptional, as they are super juicy and flavorful, anything outside of that was mediocre to not so good (fried quail, pan fried noodles with shrimp, scallion pancakes, etc.) 

I have zero desire to come back here and sit with strangers in a cramped space to eat dumplings.",0
"3.5 / 5.0 - Note: This place is Cash Only and a 15% Service Charge is added to your bill.

We'd been to other locations and came here for the tasty soup dumplings.
While smaller shops and bakeries in Chinatown have always been cash only, we hadn't expected this restaurant to be cash only. Fortunately, we had enough cash for an order of soup dumplings. There is also an ATM inside, although we didn't check the fees.

- SOUP DUMPLINGS
We ordered the Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings ($10.45+). It comes with 8 soup dumplings, which are quite large for a soup dumpling--they didn't fit in the soup ladle. They were meaty, juicy and filling, but the broth was too salty for me.

Also, the sauce barely had any ginger, which they'd brought out with the menu before we'd even ordered anything. They only gave us one, though, and never brought out another after we ordered the soup dumplings.

- SERVICE
The restaurant was not busy, since we went before noon, but the servers never came around. We had to wait to catch a server's attention across the restaurant each time to order or to pay the check. Although we would have still left a tip, we were displeased to see a 15% service charge automatically added to the bill considering the poor service.

I love soup dumplings and will continue my search for the best soup dumplings in town.",0
"The flavor was not there for their soup dumplings. I have had many dumplings in my lifetime. The MSG here is super strong and the soup dumpling skin was too thick. They lack flavor and essence in the dumplings. Pan fried dumplings were too greasy where there is remaining grease on the plate. The skin is too thick again. 

They have more big table than small tables. So if you have 2 - 4 people party, you might have a risk of sharing a table with another small group. This takes away the privacy you want. 

If i can give zero starts, i will definitely do that.",0
"Really liked their crab meat xlb and scallion pancake. It lives up to the hype! 

However, the only slightly negative comment I have about this place is that upon entering, I was hit with this huge smell of ""stinky socks"", if you could describe it like that. It was extremely unpleasant (especially by the doorway) but you get used to it once you're inside (sadly). Food is good, but just this is maybe something that could be improved. 

Due to the number of people waiting to come here, you may be asked to sit at communal tables with another party. 

It's also cash only!",0

"To comment purely about the food, this place was THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT of my entire trip to New York. Not only is there so much hype surrounding this place, paired with the impossible feat of getting a table, the food DID NOT measure up to expectations to say the very least. So tread with caution....

My boyfriend and I ordered their 'famous' Xiao long bao (soup dumplings), fried salt and pepper fish, and pan fried noodle with pork and mushrooms. Firstly, the Xiao long baos were steamed over shredded cabbage which yielded a very odd flavor to the dumplings, and in part made them so soggy/ fragile that some of our dumplings bursted before we even started eating them. There was also not enough soup in the pieces that did survive - the filling was so so but the only thing I can lend a positive review to was the size of the Xiao long bao and the amount per order, both very good! 

The fried salt and pepper fish was SOOOOO salty, like too salty and the fish was an odd mushy consistency within the fried exterior. I've had this dish before at countless other restaurants and this was the first time I had ever felt it was too salty. 

Lastly, the pan fried noodle with pork and mushrooms was good in presentation and theory, but the flavor was just so bland and blah that I couldn't get myself to eat it after the first few bites....the noodles had the texture of styrofoam and less like a fried noodle and the sauce altogether just lacked a lot of depth - oh and the mushrooms looked like they came straight from a can. 

We wanted to love this place after so many locals and so many of my friends RAVED about it, but as a restaurant with such a huge following on social media, I expected something outstanding! I've had better Xiao long baos and Chinese food in general back home in CA! Sadly a huge waste of time.",0
"If you're looking for authentic, no nonsense Chinese, specifically Shanghainese food, Joe's Shanghai is it.  Located on a small narrow street in Chinatown, the bustling frenziness and authenticity of this restaurant is almost unmatchable anywhere else. 

Yes, the soup dumplings are their staple dish and highly recommended -- there are two options.. the ones with crab meat and pork and the ones with solely pork.  I've never been a pork lover so I personally prefer the crab meat ones.  Just remember to drink the soup since that's where all the flava is!  Other dishes that haven't failed are the: Shanghai noodles, string beans with minced pork and the red bean dessert (forgot the name but it's wrapped with thin dough and lightly fried)  It's really a Shanghainese dessert so hard to find in other Chinese restaurants.

As for the atmosphere, what can I say?!  There aren't too many authentic Chinese joints that come with all around good service and sparkling tables so don't expect that here either.  What you will get is an offer to share a table with another party if it will move the waiting queue along quicker and food dropped on your table as soon as it comes out unceremoniously.  Well, you don't come here expecting 5 star treatment.. 

Hopefully, the buns alone will make up for it.

The bill will be inexpensive at least!",0
"Go up the street to Joe's Ginger. 25 Pell st. most definitely better soup dumplings,  no tourist and they don't treat you like shit. I mean it is Chinatown still,  but they're nice enough. And they have beautiful sauté Chinese broccoli!",0
"Obviously had to stop by Joe's Shanghai when my native Shanghai family came to town! I knew this place was infamous for its long wait time (last time I came on a Sunday night and waited nearly 1.5 hours) so I made sure we went at an unusual hour - 5:30pm on a Monday, and we were seated immediately. It was so empty we even had a table to ourselves! (Usually you end up sharing a table with at least 1 other party). Be warned though, I noticed that it got rapidly more crowded the closer it got to 6pm, and by the time that we left (around 6:45 maybe) it looked like there was definitely a wait to be seated. 

We ordered the hot and sour soup, pea shoots, a cold vegetable dish, and of course, the xiao long bao! The hot and sour soup was very thick but it tasted good, nice and spicy. The pea shoots were sautéed with garlic and the portion was generous. The cold dish was also fine; I don't really remember anymore because I was excited about the soup dumplings finally arriving at our table! They were actually not as good as I remembered them being when I last had them (like I mentioned above, I had been waiting for a while by that point, so maybe I was just really hungry??) but they were still pretty good. The skin was thin on the bottom, which made lifting the dumplings a bit treacherous as we tried not to break the skin, but that's the way the dumpling is supposed to be made so it's fine. The tops of the dumplings were on the thicker side compared to other dumplings in the city. As for the fillings, the crab and pork one was a little fishy, and the plain pork one was okay. I think I might like Shanghai Café's xiao long bao better now that I've tried Joe's twice - either Joe's is inconsistent and the xiao long bao really was better last time, or they rely on people's hunger to color their perceptions of the food.",0
"I was so excited about this xiao long bao, because people are talking so highly about this restaurant and everybody I met asked me to try it here. In addition to that, it has 4 stars in yelp with over than 1400 reviews. So I think it must be amazing. I went here on the weekend and the waiting line was only less than 20 minutes. It was on the weekend and lunch hour. Nice! So I ordered 2 pork and 1 pork+crab xiao long bao. 

When the orders came, I was so excited and I took the first bite with excitement. It was sooooooo disappointing. The skin of the dumpling was soooo dry, chewy, and hard. I can see the flour on top of the dumpling. I barely wanna chew the skin of the dumpling. The soup was great, but the meat was just okay. Nothing special. I don't know why people love this place so much. I still think Los Angeles' Din Dai Fung is still the best xiao long bao I ever eat.",0
"I got very sick from eating here today so be careful.  I had dim sum, noodles, and fried dumplings and felt fine until about 6 hours later and then just started vomiting profusely several times.  I had no other food today and no alcohol.  I will never eat there again.

Not to mention that the food is indistinguishable from any other Chinese restaurant, the ""20 minute wait"" is actually an hour, and the only way to describe the style of the wait stuff is ""bum's rush.""",0
"Argh! I double tipped. What a shady business practice. This explains why the service was so good and streamlined; dealing with a capacity crowd is no small feat for NYC.

Place is packed with customers. They seat different parties together at the large round tables. Hurray! I got seated with the easily-impressed overexcited amateur group. No coat check, my trench got stepped on a few times. 

The food was edible. Nothing impressive. I can easily think of 3 other dumpling spots in the Los Angeles SGV I'd rather eat at. 

Apparently people love the dumpling juice. Well my crab dumpling juice was fishy tasting and oozed traces of the dirty yellow ""crab mustard"".

I'm revoking some folks' Asian cards. A NYC Din Tai Fung would put Joe's out of business. It's not even close.",0
Got here on a busy Friday night and was seated next to 2 other parties which I didn't mind since I grew up in Chinatown and it was pretty normal to be sitting next to strangers. We got each of the dumplings and they all tasted OK. They all tasted about the same and I wasn't really blown away with any of these. Was't the best soup dumplings I've ever had but it was OK for what it was.,0
"This used to be my favorite place for soup dumplings until I found Nan Xiang in Flushing (so now every weekend I'm conflicted over making the trek out to Flushing, and my desire for delicious soup dumplings). Joe's soup dumplings are still really good, the skin is really thin, the soup is flavorful. However, everything else on the menu is a wash. This place has turned into a tourist destination and the waiters/menu now caters more to western taste (and prices). Every time I go, there's always a line out the door, and you're inevitably going to have to share a table with strangers.",0
"Errrrr, as someone having Xiao long bao for over 20 yrs , I have to say this place makes something I would never consider as Xiao long .... It's sooo big and the cover is just too thick .... Can't understand y so many ppl praised it",0
"Honestly, this place is overhyped. Definitely NOT even worth the 30+ minutes wait. 

I ordered the pork and the crab meat soup dumplings. The pork is not that good, pretty bland and the skin is too thick. The crabmeat has better flavor, but again, the dumpling skin is way too thick. My friend said this place doesn't live up to the praise and hype. If the line is shorter, I might come and grab some crabmeat soup dumplings when I'm really craving some.",0
"I was so excited to come back here - my last trip was around 4 or 5 years ago. Since then it seems like they moved and must have changed the soup dumpling recipe. I used to rave about these dumplings- they used to be small, delicate, and the soup inside was perfect. Todays dumplings were huge, thick wrappers, and filled with so much fat it started to make my stomach turn. Disappointed.",0
"for those that want below par food or can be classified under the category of tourists, this is your place to go.  they are experienced with non asian speakers. also, long waits for a table equal high quality food, right? i mean come on! everyone is going there!

almost everytime i pass by this place, i see a line out the door with people holding their zagat guides waiting to get a seat during dinner time. i use to come here when i was a kid, when chinatown was less crowded, when tourists didnt even know what a soup dumpling was....

but now with shanghai cuisines popping up all over the city, there are much better places to go if youre a local. a hole in the wall usually is best.... goodluck on your search!",0
"This was loud and crowded, but we had to leave when several members of staff crowded around our table to make fun of someone in our party who was disabled. They actually pulled friends out of the kitchen to stand near us and laugh. We had to leave. This has never happened to us in such an open and mocking way. Shame on this staff.",0
"Poor service, we asked them for water 4 different times and it took forever! The food wasn't even good either! And to top it off they only take cash, so we had to go to the ATM and take out cash with a $3 fee, so stupid!",0
"SERVICE CHARGE IS INCLUDED.  Their food prices are already not cheap and they started adding tips on the check and don't even tell the guests.  When I tell fellow diners next to me at a communal table who were calculating the tip amount, they wouldn't believe me at first and asked the waiter to confirm.  The waiter pretended that he doesn't understand and wouldn't give a clear answer.  After asking several times if the tip was already added on the total, he reluctantly said yes.  This is also CASH ONLY place.  They give you the check, and you look at the total and leave a few bills and they will return change without a copy of the check.  I've seen many innocent people leaving tips without knowing it's already included.  If you don't have cash, there is an ATM machine at the entrance of the restaurant and the fee is $3.5!!!
Food is good but not great.  Table is disgusting and you have to sit with random strangers if you don't have enough people in your party.  As soon as you are seated, number of wait staff will rush you to order while you browse the menu.  Why add servie charge when there is no service?  This place has become an expensive tourist trap and I am appalled by their sneaky business practice.",0
Good food and good prices. Crispy beef tasty. Black mushrooms and bamboo shoots would have been nicer if sliced bite-sized. All-round acceptable. Would recommend esp for small groups watching their spending money.,0
Horrible service. Terribly crowed. The food doesn't live up to expectation. Honestly have no idea where they got their high ratings from. I would give zero star if there's such option.,0
"So I never make bad reviews but don't expect all the  great things you hear about Joe's Shanghai. We came for the XLB which were good but overcooked. They were all  stuck together so when we tried to get them with the tongs they opened and half the  soup came out in the dish before  before getting to our plates. But the real problem here was that the service was beyond horrible and I know not to expect great service in Chinatown but this server was the rudest. He didn't even look at us while ordering, he knocked my tea over (which is complimentary but just tastes like hot water) when he brought the food and didn't apologize, and he snapped at me when I asked a question and then when I snapped back he acted like I was the rude one and told all the rest of the staff and they all circled my table like a bunch of vultures and he got someone else to give me my check. I have never seen something so ridiculous there are other places in Chinatown with food that is just as good without the shit service. Joe's Shanghai is super overrated.",0
"Overrated. I might be a bit too harsh on this establishment but here's why I'm rating 2-star. For a place with thousands of reviews, I'm expecting some top notch food but Joe's just doesn't deliver. Arriving at 530pm, I was in a 30-40 minute wait. Once you're inside you'll get seated at a table with other people unless your party is big enough to fill one of those big round tables. Don't really mind it though, just something you should anticipate. It's as clean as you'd expect from a ""real"" Chinese restaurant. I had the Xiao long nap, scallion pancake, and general tso chicken. It's decent. I'm from socal and this place is just about as good as any 3-star place you'll find here but with a long wait and less spacious. If this is the best Chinese New York has to offer then I'll be avoiding it for the rest of my time here. Also cash only, but no tip since it's included in the price. If anyone knows a better place to get Chinese food, send me a PM!",0
"I felt kinda nasty after leaving and found the soup dumplings here to be a little on the gelatinous side. They were ok, but I'm not going back since the wait is out of hand.",0
"Of course we came for the soup dumplings. They were pretty good. And fun to eat. 

We also tried the shanghai noodle soup, which was hearty and comforting. The broth was a little too salty for me. I actually diluted the leftovers with water the next day and that helped. 

We also tried the chicken with rice cakes and the cabbage beef and mushroom dish served with tortillas. The flavors aren't complex. Generally everything is really salty. It tastes good (in a fast food way), but not exactly rich or interesting.",0
"Great Chinese specialty restaurant... but time is money too.

Joe's Shanghai does indeed offer some of the best tasting soup dumplings in the area. There is no doubt about it. They have the traditional pork soup dumplings and also the less often seen seafood and pork soup dumplings.

However, the waits are sometimes ridiculous. I mentioned that time is money. But more than that, I really believe that you can get great soup dumplings all over Chinatown. It doesn't necessarily have to be at Joe's Shanghai. If you're not into soup dumplings or not hoping to try them, don't even waste your time. Aside from the soup dumplings, Joe's Shanghai's menu is just okay. You can definitely find those items elsewhere in the vicinity without the wait, and they are probably just as good or better tasting.",0
"came here because of the yelp reviews, very disappointed. this might be a good place for people who've never had real xiaolongbao or chinese food in china, but if you grew up in china eating authentic chinese food, this will more than likely become a disappointment. their xiaolongbao is not authentic, okay?! first, it breaks/falls apart when you try to pick it up no matter how much care you take--a real xiaolongbao is not supposed to do this! think sushi, would it be real sushi if everything just comes apart when you try to pick it up?!! the magic of xiaolongbao lies in the fact that you're able to taste the dumpling and the soup inside the dumpling all at once in one single bite, when a xiaolongbao falls apart and the soup and meat leak out, it's just not xiaolongbao anymore!!!! what's more, their xiaolongbao is twice as big as a real xiaolongbao--as i said before, a real xiaolongbao is supposed to be eaten in one bite so the soup doesn't leak out--it's impossible to eat their xiaolongbao in one bite unless you have an ENORMOUS mouth!! we also ordered a typical/traditional shaghainese dessert, which turned out to be a disaster! and another dish--another disaster! 
din tai fung is the place to eat authentic xiaolongbao, too bad there's only a few in LA and none in NYC!",0
"Drove all the way to the city to try the highly rated dumplings from upstate. They were okay. Not bad, just okay. The Shanghai noodles were bland but mixed with Lions Head was pretty good. The turnip short cakes were awesome and the only reason I rated this place a 3 star.",0
"As for me I don't like this place-- it looks like a cheap not very clean diner. We came at 1pm and had to share a circular table. I ordered my favorite orange chicken and it was not very good but not bad. The only thing that I liked was the pork dumpings. Also the restroom looked very dirty and there was a sign near the sink that said some man peed there, I think staff must do the cleaning work better. 
P.S. be careful they put the tip in a bill.",0
Such a disappointment....waited 40 minutes. Had so much better food. Soup dumplings literally broke apart before it even got to my spoon. Seriously I could have just ordered regular dumplings,0
"Went here on a weekday around 2pm and the wait was only 10 minutes. Not bad for a table of 8, right? Except they sat us with 3 strangers. Didn't really bother me, but odd. I guess you gotta do what you gotta do to keep maximum business.

As far as the food is concerned, I felt that their dishes were typical of any Chinese restaurant. The only one that stood out was, of course, their soup dumplings. I was a total newbie and didn't know how to eat these, so don't be like me and stab it with a fork. The name says it all, there's soup inside. They had 2 types: pork and crab. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the pork more and they were cheaper. 

This restaurant is deep in Chinatown, which was good because if you want Chinese food, this is the place to go to. The restaurant was typical with the aquarium at the entrance and questionable bathrooms in the back. Service was average for a typical Asian restaurant. Although, if they seem like they're rushing you when they order, they are, but they do make really good recommendations to expedite the ordering process. All of the dishes were yummy. No complaints with the food.",0
"It's chinese food... so service was very chinese, haha. The famous dumplings were good... salty like I'd expect it to be, but I don't see what the big deal is... it's good- and it's modestly priced (it is chinese food though)... and the sweet and sour soup was decent too although they put a couple different kind of mushrooms in, some of which just didnt belong (not in the magic mushroom sort of way), but in the asian cuisine kind of way. Overall it was pretty good-- warmed us up in the rain, and didn't break the bank. So go if you can... don't if you can't.",0
"This is where you go for the fun and the experience with people who make an outing fun. The food is pretty good, the soup dumplings ARE good, very good actually if you're into them but the rest is a bit weird. I love the green bean side but most main dishes are not the best.",0
"The three stars is for the food only.

This is a fast-paced restaurant with very minimal service.  You will need to ask for every single thing you want (water, etc.).

I go somewhat regularly (at least once a month) and I've noticed that they are pressuring their customers for bigger tips.  This is corroborated by other reviews I've read here on Yelp.  If you tip less than 20% or so, they seem to get upset.",0
"Since I live across the street, I ordered from Joe's Shanghai. It was odd that my order was ready for pickup (in 5 mins!), even though no one else was waiting for food. It was annoying that the total was $19.50 cash. The restaurant is still adding the mandatory 25% tip (even if you pick up the order personally)! They won't be serving anyone in the dining room at 45 Bowery (new location) until the COVID-19 pandemic is over. There's no temporary al-fresco patio with tables & chairs like other restaurants have constructed.

It was even more disappointing that the ""pork meat soup dumplings"" ($7.95) were lukewarm, not hot. The wrapper was much thicker (poorer quality) with a much smaller amount of pork mixture. Since there was almost no soup, a spoon was unnecessary for the bland soup which might've been reabsorbed into the wrapper. The dumplings were NOT traditional Shanghai soup dumplings that we Chinese have eaten most of our lives. (2) The ""pork fried dumplings"" ($7.95), with the tiniest amount of meat, were also prepared poorly & NOT hot. Both dishes were very bland & mediocre! We do not recommend this new Joe's Shanghai location.",0
"This place is way overrated and someone of a tourist trap. Want good soup dumplings? Then try Shanghai Dimsum on Elizabeth Street. Joe's tends to have a lot of oil in the ""soup"", and a lot less broth. Also, it is kind of weird staring at people eating these things when you're at a giant roundtable. You almost lose your appetite watching people trying to shove these things in their mouth. They are good though, just not here.",0
"if you're looking for authentic shanghai xiao long bao DO NOT COME HERE this place is an absolute joke. I'm from California but my parents grew up in shanghai and I spent many years of my childhood flying back and forth from Asia and California. I've eaten so many delicious xiao long baos I can't even count and I really take pride in my culture and heritage. 

AUTHENTIC SOUP DUMPLING: like the name suggests, they're supposed to be small and pack a light, flavorful punch. The soup is filled with flavor and dumpling skin is thin but strong enough to hold the meat and soup. The meat is also supposed to be tender and juicy as well. That's basically my description of an authentic xiao long bao. 

SOUP DUMPLINGS HERE: incredibly subpar. Skin was way too thick, the soup was overly greasy and heavy, and the meat was too fatty. The xiao long baos came out and were basically unrecognizable. These dumplings were massive and looked nothing like what they're supposed to be. We also ordered the beef noddles and, again, were given greasy, oily, heavy food that was bland and disgusting. 

Another thing about this place that left me completely unsatisfied was the horrible service. Waited almost 30 minutes just for a class of water and was not treated the way customers should be treated. I don't understand the hype of this place at all. They do NOT serve authentic xiao long baos, there's horrible customer service, and food is subpar to say the least.",0
Came here twice and honestly the quality decreased and it is a tourist trap for those who have not had good dumplings before. No locals ever go here which says a lot. Service isn't good because its so busy and every one just wants to you to hurry up and leave. If you want good dumplings ask a local. If you want to be a tourist who wants mushy oily hard chewy dumplings with bad service come here.,0
"For a city NY's size, there MUST be better dumplings elsewhere...yet other Yelpers seem to love this place. I've lived in Asia and Vancouver BC, so I know a great dumpling. But let's start at the door and  the posted ""B"" rating from the health dept. I overlooked it as I figured do many happy Yelp reviews couldn't be wrong. In fact, my soup spoon wasn't completely clean...ack. * Now to the dim sum: people rave about their xiao long bao. I found the dumplings had an off-balance ratio of meat to dough, and the meat was a bit loose rather than a tight ball. The flavor was nothing special. I also tried an onion-oil pancake, which was served a bit overcooked for my liking. I would not return.",0
"This was our very first meal on our trip to New York and after a short wait (because we were willing to share a table), we were treated to a feast of classic Shanghainese dishes. Although very popular and well known, we found that the food was too oily and other than their signature dishes, there was something left to be desired. 
The dishes we ordered included: 

Xiao Long Bao - their most famous dish and for good reason. Thin skin, filled with soup and meat that was not too fatty but flavourful.

Potstickers - very good as well, nice skin and tasty meat filling. 

House Special Glazed Crispy Chicken - thinking that it would be a half chicken cut up we were surprised to see golden glazed chicken chunks that were battered and fried similar to sweet and sour pork. Served with broccoli, we were so surprised to love this dish. With white meat chunks that were not over battered in a perfectly sweet and tangy sauce, we finished the whole dish! 

Shanghai Fried Noodles with Pork - This was a nice sized portion of noodles that were stir fried with some veggies and pork strips but there was way too much oil.

Bok Choy with Mushrooms - wanting a veggie dish, we went with this classic. Nothing wrong but the sauce was too gloopy for me.

Lions head Meatballs - the least favourite dish of the night, we couldn't even finish it because although the portion was very large, the meat itself was not very good either being overworked or mixed to flour and much too fatty. Similar to the above, sauce was too gloopy.

Overall, I had high expectations for Joes Shanghai and was quite disappointed with the dishes that were not their ""classics"". For somewhere so popular I would have expected to be blown away but left feeling uncomfortably stuffed.",0
"if you don't like to share round tables with other folks - don't come here

The Wait List:
To begin, there will be a line and it will be long, whether you are a party of 2 or 10 and there will be groups of all sizes which goes to show the popularity of Joe's. Come as a date or with your entire group of friends, they will accommodate you. Like in the Chinese restaurant episode in Seinfeld, the person taking numbers for the waiting list will say ""about 5 ..10 minutes"", but it will be more like 40 minutes. You will feel like you are waiting and waiting and starving, and honestly the wait is half the fun and I felt it added to the crazy anticipation and excitement of trying the best dumplings that are quoted as ""better than sex"" by some other Yelper. So yes, expect to wait.

The Food:
I heard about Joe's from a friend and all the articles online fameing it as the best soup dumplings in nyc and a nyc must try before you die - so i went in fully expecting mind blowing food, but for me it didn't hit the spot. The dumplings were definitely tasty and fun to eat and watch my date eat while trying not to let the soup IN the dumpling explode OUT. The crab and pork dumpling wasn't anything unexpected and I preferred the bolder taste from the just pork dumpling (which is also $2 cheaper at $5.95, if money matters to you). The soup in the dumplings were flavorful and no complaints about the raved soup dumplings, just nothing new in flavor that I haven't tried before in asian cuisine. It just tasted as I would expect. 

*Some reviews mention the ginger dipping sauce for the dumplings as amazing, but its just soy sauce, vinegar, and some shredded ginger... It was delicious, yes, but nothing unexpected.

*The Scalion pancake is tasty and greasy and crispy and everything I had hoped for. The dipping sauce savory sweet and syrupy. That dipping sauce was our favorite part of the meal.

*We wrapped the meal together with the shredded beef noodle soup, my date's choice. She said it best, ""nothing special, but the beef is really good"". Again, the food tasted very good, but it didn't have bold flavor that sucker punches you unexpectedly and says ""who's your daddy!?"" It doesn't make you wonder what is that flavor!? What is that ingredient? How can I have this everyday!?  The broth was beefy and full of flavor. Better than most soups. The beef strips were the highlight of the soup - very soft and sweet. The noodles were disappointing. Its like water noodles with no flavor.

The End:
The experience was fun (waiting in line and eating those dumpling bombs) and now I can say I have tried Joe's Shanghai. I would come back with someone that has never been before and I would say it's a great place to try. The entire meal was less than $30 for 2 orders of dumplings (16 dumplings total which is filling), scallion pancakes, and beef soup.  

We were full, but were secretly thinking out loud to each other ""Wow, yesterday was so much more delicious at Prosperity Dumplings (big fried dumplings and on the real cheap)"".",0
I think this place is totally over-hyped. I normally swear by Yelp and the reviews. The service was terrible and the food didn't make up for it. It was over salted and average. Sorry.,0
"This place has great soup dumplings.
The moment we were seated our server asked us how many plates we will be having..
they have a peculiar way of eating so that the soup doesnt flow everywhere- you need to keep it on your soup spoon while eating it!
There was about 45 min wait on a Saturday evening around 5:30.
We were seated on a round table with a random group of people, basically thats how their seating is..
Other food was ok , not worth mentioning.
But I would def go back for their soup dumplings.",0
"I went here today with a friend. It was a busy Sunday and we waited 10 mins for a seat. Not bad.

We had crab and pork soup dumplings. The crab dumplings were just okay. The pork dumplings taste good though. Next we had the shredded pork and tofu with jalapenos. It taste good but it's a little too spicy for me. The dumplings came with a sauce that tastes like vinegar.

They included the 15% service charge in the bill, which I'm not really crazy about. In my opinion tip should be optional according to how one likes the service. Not saying I wouldn't tip the waiter. 

Would I go back? Maybe. If I do, I would order the pork dumplings again.",0
"Crab soup dumplings! Shanghai noodles! Green beans! This place hit the spot after a 6am kinda night. Fresh, hot, & not too greasey.",0
"You guys, this is NYC. There are SO many places where you can have an amazing  food, great service, AND not spend a million dollars. But this is not one of those places. You walk in and the patrons are 98% out of towners. This is what we call a tourist trap. You do not have to go here ""just to experience it"" because Betsy from book club said it was amazing. Break the cycle and make your own choices and actually enjoy yourself instead of suffering through ""an experience."" 

I went here with a couple out of town friends because they heard it was really good. *sigh* I should have know. But they brought up soup dumplings. I love soup. I love dumplings. I love soup dumplings! How could this be bad?

First of all, you will wait. And if it's cold and/or precipitating, you will hate it.

The service was horrendous! From the hostess to the server, everyone was SOO rude! It was one of the worst ""restaurant"" experiences I've ever had. I've been in NY for over 10 years and a server for most if that time, and I was shocked at how rude they were. I always tip 20% or over (I'm usually pretty understanding if a server forgets water or to put the sauce on the side - it happens) and I wanted to leave 0 tip here. But of course THEY ADD A 15% AUTOMATIC GRATUITY or else nobody would ever leave anything.

The dumplings were just ok. I tried the pork soup dumplings and they were pretty bland (although I do tend to prefer more savory, salty broths). When I broke one open, the ""meat"" was pretty unidentifiable. And all of the dishes my friends and I tried were no better than a cheap take out place. And it was pretty awkward with everyone trying to talk about how good the dumplings were, but you could tell no one really thought they were worth it.

Want some good food? Try the ramen place around the corner - Bossanova. Now THEY now how to whip up a good broth. Or go to Queens and get some REALLY good soup dumplings for much cheaper (although still some short waitstaff). Look around and you'll find SOO many options that are amazing. Act like a real New Yorker and ""know better.""

Really, this place is not worth it. Not the money. Not the wait. Not the ""experience.""",0
"Been meaning to come to this place for a fee years now; found it today with no wait so, we tried it out. Went to try their soup dumpling which has been all the rave but quite honestly, it was ok. Underwhelming if you ask me. I had the pork soup dumpling while they are a decent size, the meat is not seasoned. Also ordered kung pow chicken which was good. Didnt go crazy ordering other items as this was to try out only. 

In my opinion, the wait lines are just hype, not sure who made this place as popular as it is but it didnt meet my expectations.  Couple of things that we noticed; the person who wiped the table used a smelly towel, like the ones that sit wet for days if you know what I mean. The mens bathroom was awful. At least make it look clean, it wasn't as busy as I usually see it. Not sure I'll be back to this location,  maybe will try flushing location or go elsewhere.",0
"It was my first time visiting nyc & I was mad excited to try this place.  Heard all the hype a couple years ago & a bunch of my friends recommended me to try this place during my trip.  Soooo that being said, I decided to make this my 1st stop & get the anticipation over with.  I was also super hungry after having been on the plane for 7 hrs & in the car for another 2 hrs.  Me & my friend get there & are told there is a 25 min wait (as expected) & are given a ticket with the number 24 on it.  Me being the starving marvin I am, I'm watching the host like a hawk as she is calling out the numbers... ""20...21..22...23...25"" I'm like wait, hold up she skipped us!  And my friend says, no she's prolly just looking for bigger parties, they prolly don't have 2 seaters available.  By this time we've already waited 30 minutes.  I wanna say something but my friend keeps telling me not to, that our turn will come.  After 50 minutes I'm like fawk that, I go up to the host & ask her how much longer for #24, she says ""oh I called it a long time ago, u missed it.""  WHAAAAAT?!?!!!  by this time I wanna friggin strangle her cuz HAIL to the no we did not miss nothin, me and friend were watching her like a hawk the whole time!  Ughhhj!!!  So anyways, she seats us within 10 min & we order the crab soup dumplings & scallion pancake.  Luckily they came out pretty fast... Unluckily they both tasted fricken WUTEVAS!  I'm dead serious.. and the bullshit wait had nothing to do with it... The wait actually should've made it taste even better.  First off, scallion pancake is wayyyy overly greasy & not Enuff scallion... My mamas Korean scallion pancakes takes a huge shit on these.  And the soup dumplings were seriously NOTHING SPECIAL.  The flavors did not explode in my mouth... The soup did yes, which i understand can blow a persons mind away (-__-) but I'm talking about taste & flavor here!  Smh.. I agree with most of the people that rated 1 or 2 stars.. it's totally overrated & a tourist trap",0
The wait takes forever. We waited for over an hour and the only reason we stayed was we waited for that long already so might as well stay. I'll go back and rate the food but they starved us.,0
"Used to be a fan, but no longer. Quality has gone way down, unfortunately. Better Xia Long Lao at Emerald Kitchen and Xia Kin To.",0
"I don't understand all these raving reviews?!! I decided to give this place a try due to all the reviews and I happened to be in the area.  

First, I took off my jacket and before I got to sit down at the table, the waiter asked me if I was ready to order!  I told him that I just got here and he said ""well, you better hurry, because take long time."" Wth?!

I ordered the shrimp dumplings - horrible. It tasted like pork and imitation seafood crap! I also ordered the scallion pancakes - terrible!  I make much better scallion pancakes!  They were greasy and overcooked.

I get my change back for my bill and I literally had it for less than a minute and the waiter took it while I was figuring out the tip!  I told him I was not ready and asked for it back. HORRIBLE, horrible service and the food was terrible!  I've had 10X better Chinese food at a take out!  I will definitely not be coming back.                            
Also, if the majority of the patrons are not Asian in a crowded Asian restaurant, rule of thumb - it typically isn't good.",0
I have been waiting to come here. I am disappointed. It's just a hype. The dumplings were not great. The food were expensive and they only take cash. It was only my husband and I and they charged a 15% service fee.  There so many other place that is better and take credit.,0
"This review is only for Joe's shanghai in Chinatown NY...the service was even worse than the one in Flushing...they asked us to share table with 7 other ppl. There was barely room for us...also given it was so busy, the crab soup dumpling wasn't that great..the soup inside all came out and it tasted tasteless..but I still love the soup dumplings at joe' shanghai in general...next time I will go to the one in Manhattan..",0
"The only star I given because of the soup dumplings. Other food, services are so bad.",0
"Dim sum is ok but the dishes were just terrible. The rest foods we ordered full out of expectation. The fish head pot we need should be dry and tasty while it was served with a fish meat felt like being in the refrigerator for ages, very fishy smell and lot of soup looks like pure soybean sauce!
Other dishes we dared not even call them Chinese food. 
Service is also disappointing but surprisingly so crowded there. 

 No reason to go there again unless for dim sum only.",0
"Over rated, dumplings were good but not great compare to other dumplings places. Noodles had no taste other than heavy soy sauce.
15% tip with no smile from the servers , hurry up and get you out ASAP.",0
Because the place has high rating we expected high of it. But there is not a large variety of dumplings and we didn't really liked the idea of soup in the dumplings...,0
"I'm Chinese and i love really authentic Chinese food, this place really disappointed me. We came back to this place after many many years to check if it's still good and turns out there was not a single Chinese customer when we were there (bad sign). And we had to wait in line for more than an hour.   Ambience was bad, we had to share a table and the food did not even meet our expectations. Many many more authentic Chinese food in the city.",0
"We walked right in on a Saturday around 11:30.  Good thing we did because the crowds kept coming immediately afterwards.

The pork XLB were so delicious.  How did they make the skin so thin yet the soup stay in?   Both my husband and myself were not fans of the crap..oops I mean crab XLB.

The green onion pancake was good...a little greasy though.  The black bean noodles tasted how they should as well but nothing special.  

The price was great for the two of us and we were full. I give it 3 stars for great XLB but okay everything else.  

(FYI: Kinda gross that the server had to check every dish to make sure it was clean before giving it to us.  He went through several dirty dishes and put it back in the ""clean pile"" before bringing us out the clean ones)",0
"I was very looking forward to it, cuz it was impressive couple of years ago when I first came to NYC. 
This time, the dumplings were just OK.",0
"I heard such amazing things about this place and their soup dumplings that when my friend finally suggested it for a small get together of friends, I was pumped. I could not have been more disappointed. 

When we got there, we were supposed to be 10 people but one could not make it. They told us after waiting 15 minutes, that we lost our reservation because everyone was not coming and that we would have to wait over an hour. I basically told them if they wanted to turn away a table of 9 hungry girls, that's their loss, not ours. We waited another 5 minutes and were finally seated with two other women. 

The soup dumplings we got had no soup and smelled funky. Every other table was happily eating them though so we just assumed we got a bad batch but weren't willing to try more. 

We constantly got yelled at by the staff who could have cared less about our table. It was impossible to get a glass of water let alone anything else. They even yelled at us for improperly using the lazy susan. 

We ordered other typical dishes which were not so great or two weeks later as I write this, I would have remembered them. The price was cheap and it was good for the amount we ate, but nothing less expensive then any other place around those parts. I really dont know what the hype is all about.",0
"BOOO! Totally just a tourist thing to try in Chinatown. I get the feeling tourists come here simply because Joe's Shanghai is known...or perhaps even because the name Joe evokes a feeling of a more Americanized restaurant than your other selections in Chinatown. 

The attitudes of the staff here and at their other locations leaves NOTHING to be desired. Hostess told us the wait would be 20 minutes, but that the whole group had to be there first. Everyone arrived within 5 minutes...and suddenly the wait became 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, another 20 minutes. All of this from a painted, eyeliner tattooed American Born Chinese with horrible Chinese and even worse English. Please don't talk to me like I'm not from NY and am an idiot to waiting for tables. 

Honestly, I've had better soup dumplings, these taste like the defrosted frozen sort to me. Perhaps just an off day, but I'll never come back because of the service.",0
"Their service is worst I've experienced. Went here to try their dumplings as few friends recommended. Horrible experience began as we were placing our order. The server seemed irritated by any questions and special requests coming from our family member who could not eat certain things. Also, when I walked up to a group of servers to simply ask for some plastic forks, they commented, go back to your table and call your server... wow. Why should any customer put up to this type of shitty service and be forced to pay 15% tip that is automatically added to your bill? I could careless how good their dumplings are... never going back there.",0
"Very very greasy Chinese food. Good if you're into that. Definitely hits the spot, but not a place I'd return to unless I had an exceptional craving for their noodles.",0
"Ok. So I love Chinese food huge fan and don't expect much at all. I was told by friends to go to this place so I went! Food was good. But the problem was that the service that they provided to me was absolutely disgusting. Food was thrown at me, waiters bumped into my chair 5+ times, I had to ask for water 3 times before we all finally got waters and they yelled at us because grandma was slow getting out of the warm car. These people have no respect nor do they know how to run a business. The food was good too and it was all destroyed by people who run the place.",0
"Horrible place, the food is overrated and the fact that they don't do reservation is plain rude. They make people wait in the cold outside and ask you to not wait inside. Do yourself a favor and don't go there.",0
"To be transparent this place USE to be good but the place has GONE down the DRAIN with service, food on the other hand is either ok or just salty for tourist taste bud. 
VERY tourist oriented because of the new location next to the so call hotel that is also terrible.. 
The soup dumpling is like average no difference from Trader Joe's frozen dumplings the skin is too thick and there isn't must flavors that wows you anymore, the spicy dish is really meant for American (no offense) that can't handle the spice.. The noodle are either too chewy or too soggy what's the deal can you get it right.. The fried rice is like pebbles too hard and dry.. 
Oh on the other hand I have to say if the tunnel opens
You keep an eye out for cooks and assistance smoking or take a break out there Dude is nasty sneezed on his apron then wipes his had and back to work.. if ya get sick you know why... 
I would recommend Shanghai Asian Cuisine on the other end of the tunnel that is better even Shanghai 21 on mott st. 
I will recommend Shanghai Joe if they improve serve and revisit how their food use to be, but they need to be more attentive to their works with hygiene issues.",0
"My 2nd trip to New York as an adult and I swear I thought I haven't been here. When I walked in I realized I had.

That just means it wasn't memorable the first time around. I prefer DTF (not down to fuck, Din Tai Fung) over Joe's. It's cleaner and tastes better! 

Yes I understand New York is cramped and it's just an overall dirtier city but the quality of food is just better at DTF.

But if you live in NY I guess you really don't have a choice.

The soup dumplings are what they are, probably can find similar ones at your local dim sum place. 

The beef noodle soup wasn't as flavorful and the vegetable was just as it would be anywhere else.",0
"Just got done eating here and they are SHADY AS FUCK!!!!! Our total bill was less than $32.50. We gave them $40 and they kept the change. We told them we want change back and they said ""u said no change"".... Uh, no. If I said that then I wouldn't be expecting any change would I? Dumb ass. 

They brought our change back and I guess they didn't know I understand Chinese so they started talking shit about us. Also, the change they brought back was $3 less than what they owed us. They definitely didn't deserve the 25% tip they stole from us.

Food is ok. Service is so bad and waiters need to learn how to speak English. Any English. 

Shady ass people. Will not come back. My advice would be bring small cash ($1 or $5) if you decide to give it a try. Don't expect them to give you your change back.",0
"Wow totally disappointed.  After Yelping the best Chinese in Chinatown, this place came highly rated. When we arrived at 4pm there was already an 45 minute wait.  We thought that was a good sign.  Found the dumplings bland.  Pork, flavor non-existant.   Crab, only taste crab no subtlety of flavor.  Ordered the braised pork shoulder, was hoping for Shanghai Pork Chops, did not see them on the menu.  Before me was placed an uncarved, non trimmed monstrosity on a bed of Spinach and brown sauce.  After trimming off the inch of fat there was maybe a serving and a half of eatable pork.  Spinach and brown Sauce were good.  Orange beef was decent.  Spicy green beans were bland no seasoning.  Should have known as the number of Ethnic Chinese eating there were vastly outnumbered by the Tourists (including myself).",0
"Personally, I was a bit disappointed making the trek out here from upper east side.

We got the crab and the pork. I preferred the pork. The crab honestly left me feeling a bit sick. 

Scallions pancake wasn't bad though.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here.",0
I've  avoided this place for the past couple of years because I thought it was a tourist trap. Finally came here today and it wasn't that bad and no lines. The soup dumplings are pretty good. What I like best about them is that they have more meat compared to the other soup dumplings I've had in china town.,0
"i can see how you might say this place is good. 

joe's serves its share of yummy food, from the xiao long bao (or i guess they like to call it soup dumplings) to the cong you bing (scallion pancake) to the chao nian gao (uhh.. shanghai-style fried rice cakes? i think that's what it translates into). these are three of the most classic shanghainese dishes to order, and they pull it off without a hitch here. i especially like how their xiao long bao places more emphasis on the soup rather than the dough wrapping. 

however, places like this are a dime a dozen, especially in densely-populated areas of asian restaurants. and paired with the ridiculous wait times, i just can't justify coming here twice. not when there's just as good nearby or out in flushing (where the original joe's is located). the only reason i would come back again is to try the shi zi tou (lion's head), which i didn't have the space to try last time.

prices are competitive here, and for the portion sizes, you probably won't find a better deal. although it's cheap, remember to bring cash because that's all they accept here.

you also have a CLEAR advantage here if you speak chinese. the hostess is nicer and more helpful, and the waiters are much more attentive. this is a plus for me, but i know it's rude to other people and service technically shouldn't be biased like this (except we all know that chinese restaurants have notoriously bad service).",0
Remember it's cash only guys! Definitely like their XLBs but it was a little different this time. hopefully it's just a one time thing.,0
"I just wasn't that impressed. The soup dumplings are tasty and affordable (8 for $7), but they are too big for the spoon and ours stuck to the bottom of the steamer, half of them cracking open on the way to our mouths and losing soup. Not cool. The cold sesame noodles tasted like pasta and peanut butter (not in a great way) and lacked crispness. The chicken in the chicken noodle soup was very tender and tasty but the soup itself was funky (in a 'Am I going to get sick from this?' kind of way.  Everyone has a bad day in their restaurant, but for me I'm not going back.",0
"Overrated.  Definitely NOT the best dumpling I've ever had. 

Located in Chinatown and was not surprised at all walking into a busy restaurant, but the waiter walked us all the way to the back and had us sit next to a couple...at the same table!  WTF? I mean, I guess I shouldn't be so surprised since this IS Chinatown.

Ordered the steamed pork dumplings right when we sat down, since we knew these were going to take awhile.  Everything else on the menu seemed regular and nothing in particular stood out to us, so we just ordered veggies and a plate of Shanghai noodles. 

Dumplings finally came out, and yes, they were big!  I noticed the soup inside looked a little brown, so when I took my first bite, all the soup came out and I got to see that they had marinated the meat with some soy sauce or something that made the soup look much darker than usual.  I must admit, these were the juiciest dumplings I've had so far because they had a LOT of soup.  However, it wasn't the taste I was looking for.  I usually like the simple soup, straight from the pork flavor. I wasn't impressed at all and only ate 2.   Noodles came out really bland and wasn't much tastier than the ones I usually have back home.  Disappointed.   

I don't think this was what I expected to eat when I flew all the way here from SF.  I wouldn't say I had a bad experience here, but definitely would not come back again if I was visiting.  This is the kind of restaurant where I would come once in awhile IF I was living in NY.",0
"The food overall was very good. Especially the sesame chicken and Lo-Mein. However, they did not have a very descriptive menu. The hot sour soup had broiled shrimp in it and it did not say it on menu. Also the seating hostess was quite rude and snapped at us bc we did not move fast enough to our table.",0
"Came here on our NYC trip because of glowing popularity and reviews (some claimed it is the best in NYC). However we were pretty meh :/ 

At least we came here early so that we don't need to wait, so it wasn't like we wasted time waiting. We ordered dumplings and scallion pancakes, as none other dishes interest us. Both were good, at least not too salty (which I was expecting), but didn't wow us. The dumplings were huge?!?!? The scallion pancakes were fried and crispy. 

I seriously had better, but what prompted me to visit was because I thought NYC doesn't lack good Chinese food, so it must be legit? However it really is just ok. If you are in the area, craving for dumplings, there is no line and you have cash, come. Otherwise, there's a million more things to eat in NYC. 

Not to mention the decor, wow so old school and 20 years ago? Maybe that's what attracts people and add to the ""authenticity"", but still very meh to me lol",0
"Everyone comes for the soup dumplings and they were better than average, though I did find the dough too chewy.

Service was fast, the place is small. I actually much rather the Flushing or the Midtown location than here. Also, too many tourists.",0
Omg the worst Chinese we have had since the Pandemic!! Seriously inedible!  The only thing I ate was the lomein! The beef with scallions has 0 flavor and tasted like dishwater. The dumplings were so doughy we couldn't find the filling. The crispy chicken was dry and flavorless!! We threw it all out and had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches along with the boring but edible lomein,0
"Was in Chinatown for a friends wedding and first thing in the morning we booked it down to Joe's shanghai because my bf, who is a fan of YouTube food channels, saw that this the the place to go for Xiao Long Bao or soup dumplings! 

We arrived right as they were opening and there was already a small gathering of people waiting outside. We quickly made it in though and secured 3 seats at a communal table which we would later share with another sweet couple and a man solo dining. It was a little awkward at first, but we quickly talked and became friends with our new dining buddies! Ofc, don't feel pressured to socialize with your table mates, I saw plenty of other communal tables just minding their own business and enjoying their food quietly! Within 5-10 minutes, the restaurant was PACKED and a line was quickly forming out the door. We got lucky! 

We ordered two baskets of the pork soup dumplings, and I got the pan fried crispy noodles with beef and mixed veggies. My bf and friend each got some kind of beef noodle soup. The soup dumplings came out steaming and fresh and looked so beautifully authentic in the bamboo baskets. Usually, people eat them by super carefully lifting them and placing them on a spoon. Then you nibble a small hole on the side and suck out some soup. Then you one shot that whole thing and let the rest of the delicious soup and pork explode in your mouth! The soup was soooo decadent and flavorful it was almost overwhelming. Definitely on the heavier side, but so delicious. The pork was seasoned well and complemented the soup perfectly. After my 4th dumpling, I was already feeling weighted down haha! They pack a punch! 

My fried noodle dish was pretty good as well! The sauce was my favorite part! So delicious with mostly savory flavors and a hint of sweetness! The beef was very tender and pretty good quality as well. As for my bf and friends noodle soups, they said it was just alright. It wasn't that great or anything. They ended up just killing those dumplings and getting full off of that. 

The other sad thing was that the dumpling skins would get stuck to each other or on the bottom of the basket and when you go to grab it, it would rip. All that beautiful soup would come spilling out in the basket *CRIES*. If it was one, I'd be ok with it, but this happened to like 5 or 6 of the dumplings and just shows that the careful artistry in constructing the skins and making sure they don't stick to the bottom wasn't there. A little sad all that soup was wasted:/

The service is kind of abrupt and curt, but they are fast and get the job done. Their English seems quite limited so I don't mind the one word responses. 

Overall, I think I would come back just for the dumplings. Their other dishes are great, but you can get those anywhere else. I saw stuff like Kung Pao and general tsos chicken. I liked how they had a wall with photos of all the celebs that came to eat there! Definitely give this place a try if you can beat those lines!",0
"Definitely something we would try again.  If I were rating the Soup Dumplings on their own merit, 3535 stars!!!

However, I'm not.  I have to review this restaurant as a whole experience.  

Obviously it's a local favorite since the Chinese barber across the street told us to go there...or maybe he was just being lazy.

We were not overly impressed with the other dishes we had and although we did talk to everyone at our round table...I didn't really like the round table.  I felt very crammed in, elbowing people I didn't know...and feeling bad that my tea pot was invading there table space.

We had a sour cabbage and pork noodle soup that was good and a Jalepeno Pork and Squid stir fry that was not very good...too salty.",0
Not the best cleanoiness.  The only good thing on menu was king pao chicken. Over priced. Wouldn't return. Rude staff.,0
"Nothing special, the soup dumplings were a bit soggy.",0
"Might have been good once upon a time, but now it's just a tourist place. The xlb was freakishly huge. 

FYI I'm a xlb snob. I traveled to Shanghai just to eat xlb, and omg it's amazing there. I know there's no way joe can compare, it's Shanghai. But even San Francisco is WAY better.",0
"There is a formula for this place. If you want to get soup dumplings, great! Just order tons and tons of soup dumplings.

Do not get distracted by the many other things on the menu because you will be disappointed. We came here and got - hot/sour soup, mapo tofu, pork shoulder and clams in black bean sauce.

He wandered away from the ""plan"" and proceeded to curse ourselves on the way home. Again, just get TONS and TONS of soup dumplings.",0
"Imagine the soul-crushing disappointment when you bite into a delectable xiao long bao, only to discover that all the soup has leaked out. This happened to at least HALF of our soup dumplings, even before we touched them. The first one I picked up had a hole in the bottom and I quickly ate it to salvage what soup was left. We were not so fortunate with the others, which were also broken and had leaked all of the soup by the time we got to them. I guess we should just count ourselves lucky that we had three that were actually intact.

If we hadn't been so unfortunate, I would have rated Joe's Shanghai higher. However, the xiao long bao is the main draw here! You should at least get that right.",0
"Very busy...we arrived around noon on a Sunday and were seated right away at a round table with two other parties. It appears to be all communal seating...not sure what the seating situation is during less busy times...if there are any!!!
Plenty of wait staff but there is a sense of rush the whole time! Unfortunately I hadn't studied the menu beforehand and was disappointed that none of the soup dumplings were vegetarian. I felt the need to make a fast decision so I chose vegetable lo-mein!!! There was nothing wrong with it. I was just hoping to try something more interesting but I felt the waiter had no interest in making suggestions or helping me find a meatless option. They are interested in serving you as quickly as possible and getting you out of there. My son did try the pork soup dumplings and said they were delicious. Cash only and they add the gratuity regardless of the size of the party! My personal experience was just ok!",0
"I do love their soup dumplings, but the rest of the food, e.g. the scallion pancakes, is oily and about the quality you'd get at another decent Chinese place nearby. The food is cheap, the service is fast and efficient. The community seating can be a bit disorienting, the cash-only policy annoying, and the wait time ridiculous. All in all, there are better places to go - try Xi'an Famous Foods around the corner, followed by dessert at Chinatown Ice Cream Factory.",0
"It doesn't  even deserve an one star. Worst place I ever been to. They charge you a 15% service for being mean and rude. I heard everyone said this is a must go place when you visit NY Chinatown for dumplings ""Xiao long bao"". The dumplings is just average. I had better. It's not worth it unless you want to be treated like dirt. Talked to the manager and she said oh cash only. WTH.",0
"The food is really, really good. 
The pork soup dumplings are amazing.
You will have to wait a longggg time.

All that said: IF YOU TRY TO EAT HERE WITH YOUR SERVICE DOG, prepare for a battle. 

Nobody working here or managing this place knows anything about service dog laws. I know most people don't, but this is a super popular restaurant in New York City. A lot of people with service dogs live and visit here. They really could do better.

There is no such thing as licensing or registration for service dogs. There is no service dog registry. There are no such things as official service dog IDs. Any service dog ID anyone in the US has is a prop bought online. While some legit handlers do buy them for situations exactly like this, it's literally not a thing. Despite explaining this to a manager and 3 different hostesses, and literally pulling up the US Dept of Justice's ADA website FAQ on service dogs, they were attempting to refuse access. Meanwhile, my dog is sitting quietly at my side throughout this whole ordeal. It was only after putting up a great deal of an argument and being asked to show them documentation from my DOCTOR that they asked for (ILLEGAL) that they let my party in, after telling us they would seat us far away from other customers (not a problem for me, but also illegal to segregate SD handlers in public spaces). My SD laid down under my chair for the entire meal and I don't think a single patron nor our waiter noticed him till we left. Was super frustrating and I was just lucky I had it in me to put up a fight that day or I wouldn't have eaten there.",0
"Apparently Joe's Shanghai has the best soup dumplings here. Maybe I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to soup dumplings, but these do not hold a candle to the soup dumplings I had out in San Francisco. The skins on the dumplings here are too thick, and the dumplings are too large. I like my dumplings smaller, closer to bite size, which is how they do them out west. Heck, I wouldn't even say these are the best soup dumplings in New York; the ones at Shanghai Cafe are better. The main reason I really am not a fan of the soup dumplings is that more than half of the ones I ordered with my girlfriend had little to no soup in them at all. If I wanted to order regular pork dumplings, I would've ordered it off the menu...but to say the least, it's a bit underwhelming. The dumplings that make it out intact are pretty good, but those are relatively few and far between.

The rest of the food is pretty good; the moo shu pork is delicious, along with the clams in black bean sauce. It's a bit hard to enjoy the food if you go at peak hours, though; as it's a tourist hot spot, the restaurant gets packed, and when you're crowded around a group table, it's not a terribly enjoyable culinary experience. The service is lackluster by Chinatown standards; it took us a good 15 minutes or so for them to serve up our round of soup dumplings...at 10 PM at night when there were quite a few empty spots in the restaurant. All in all, Joe's is a decent restaurant, but it's a bit overrated in my book. Don't forget to bring cash either - they don't accept credit cards.",0
"I took my family here tonight. I'm a New Yorker and they were visiting from Florida. Worst experience at a restaurant in my life.
Let me first say we are fairly easy going group just looking for some good food. 

It began with the hostess being extremely aggressive and accusatory. 

I told her there were seven in my party and my grandmother was waiting in the car since it was 32 degrees outside. And there was no space to wait inside. She kept questioning if my entire party was there. After waiting an hour... our table was finally ready but the hostess refused to seat us because my grandmother was getting out of the car. After one minute she continued threatening to give our table away. 

It was so uncomfortable the sole reason I did not walk out was because we were starving and had already waiting so long...

The entire experience was a complete disaster. The food was good but the service was constantly scouting and knocking into us and over things the entire time. The food wasn't good enough to ever have to deal with all that again..

I literally just began saying hello hello and TWO waiters walked by me with no response.

With that sad, unless you are the most patient person in the world I would skip this hell whole and order seamless.",0
"Not a traditional Chinese, the restaurant cooked more like American ways.  You can see not many chinese people in the restaurant.  Kinda disappointed and don't think I will return again.",0
"I was so so excited to finally get to try this Michelin rated Shanghai dumpling spot that people have been raving about for years!  Sadly, it didn't blow my mind away. Luckily I came at an off about on a weekday around 3:30 pm so there was no crazy lines outside so I had no wait time.  The inside is nothing special, it's your typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere....loud and a lot going on.  

I only wanted to try their famous soup dumplings so I ordered one set.  They came out very quickly and were huge.  I've never seen these types of dumplings so big.  The filling and soup were just ok, what I didn't like was the outside skin.  It was so thick and doughy almost bread like....not delicate at all.  Sadly, it did NOT hit the mark for me.  Maybe it was an off day or this place is just overrated.

The place is CASH ONLY!   Unfortunately, these did NOT blow my mind away like I was hoping for after all these high reviews.",0
"Go there for the steamed mini soup buns, but stay for nothing else.  For true, edible Shanghai fare, there are a couple other places in chinatown I would recommend over this place.",0
"Not so much. 
Been here 3,4-5 times. WHY?
Not so much. 
Too many other FANTASTIC choices. 
You just can't rest on your laurels and depend on your previous success in this biz. Thumbs DOWN.",0
"Am I missing something. How does this place have so many good reviews. I only came here to try their ""famous"" xiao long bao and ended up with giant hockey pucks. The XLB was soo big it didn't even fit in the soup spoons. And the dough was so thick we would only drink the soup and eat the meat inside.",0
"This review is for the Chinatown location - a cramped, poorly maintained, over-hyped and over-priced restaurant serving, at best, average Shanghainese food.  It is a chaotic waiting experience (go inside to get a number!), and once seated, unless you are a party of 5-6 or more, you will likely be seated at a table with another party.  It was kind of cool, but unexpected. The service is just awful. There is no other way to fairly or accurately characterize it.  The waitstaff is all men, and our assigned waiter was dismissive, rude and unhelpful, to put it politely.  He forgot our daughter's food, and we had to ask TWO other waiters to bring us rice to accompany our dishes. 

We ordered the mixed pork/crab xiao long bao.  They were delicious and by far the highlight of a mediocre meal.  The eggplant in garlic sauce was greasy and had little flavor to it.  The pan-fried Shanghai noodles, despite having spinach mixed in, was bland and greasy.  The final dish was the General Tso's chicken (their spelling, not mine) and that was served hot, had decent flavor and was not overly sauced.  The broccoli that was supposed to be in the dish was served cold on the side.

The waitstaff has NO incentive to provide good service.  There is a mandatory 18% tip added to your bill.  So, whether they serve you well, or not, is irrelevant because they still get a nice tip.  In no other universe, would service this bad get anything close to 18%.  I suspect that may be why they instituted the mandatory service fee.

There are other places in NYC to get delicious xiao long bao served in a clean restaurant with good service. You would be wise to explore the alternatives. We will not be returning.

PS: We witnessed them ""clean"" the tables by dumping tea from either the kettle or used teacups onto the table and wiping them down.  Given that I had drank out of my teacup (my lipstick was visible on the side), it meant they cleaned the table with used tea!  Really?!",0
"I've been coming to this Joe's for I can't believe it 18 years I was part of the brave crew that discovered this place and I have brought countless people here. Well today was my last visit. After dutifully waiting an hour longest wait ever I walked up to the door hostess and she the wait would be 45 more minutes unless I pay $20. Ugh!!! I would have been happy to pay for a table when I got there before waiting, but now I've got a kid and a couple of seniors waiting isn't an option any longer so we needed to sit so I paid ten dollars got a table and had a very late lunch. But as a result will never return. And I will now share this story with the Hundred people I shared this place with.",0
"I was coming here with high expectations that I would be getting close to the best xiao long bao in the US.  I ended up very disappointed.   Their xia long bao may be very authentic, but if that is the case, I don't like authentic.  This place is worth trying out at least once, but I won't be back.

I thought the dumplings had plenty of soup inside.  However, I thought the soup and meat filling were greasy and had too much fat.   The meat in the dumpling was also fatty enough and/or finely ground enough that I found the filling mushy.  I would prefer a thinner broth with a leaner meat filling.

I came at 11AM which is right around opening time on a Saturday.   There was no wait at the time, but the place quickly filled up after and there is table sharing.",0
"One of the worst food experiences I've ever had , not just in NYC, but in general.  We were one of the first tables to get seated and get our orders in.  We ordered the spicy Szechuan beef dish and an order of their popular crab meat and pork soup dumpling.  It is absolutely unacceptable that our food came to us an hour later, way long after other patrons who got seated 20 minutes after us and have received their orders!  I wouldn't have felt so mad if the food was actually good.  The beef dish was so oily and had no flavor.  I almost threw up instantly after the first bite.  Let's move onto the dumplings.  I cannot believe people rave about them.  They were crappy at best and I would consider that a compliment.  I've tasted frozen dumpling samples from Hmart that were better.  The service was just as good as their beef dish, nausea inducing.  If you are looking to be severely disappointed in food and wish to get diarrhea for the rest of your day than I invite you to go to Joe's Shanghai!  I should have known better than to come here once I saw their B rating for sanitation.  Bubble guts here I come!",0
"I went to New York with some friends and they highly recommended the soup dumplings at this place.  

We waited for about an hour before we got seated which I didn't mind too much since...well...we were in New York...there was a lot to see around the restaurant that the time just went by.  The restaurant is really crowded though and there isn't a lot of room for the waiters to get around the table.  You also get seated with random strangers.  If this place is so popular why not invest in a bigger location?So far...not so great but tolerable.  

I'm used to getting served water and having it refilled periodically but the waiter never bothered after he served it to us the first time.  It was hard to get his attention because a) the restaurant is super busy and b) the restaurant is extremely crowded and there was probably no room for him to even serve water that often.  He wasn't very attentive (-1).  

I got the soup dumplings since I had never tried those before.  They come out in a wooden (bamboo?) steaming basket so your dumplings can stay fresh.  The dumplings were large and plentiful (great price too).  Tried it.  Ummm...where is the flavor?  It was so bland!  THIS is what people were crazy about?!  I'm sorry I guess it's the Indian in me and I appreciate savory foods.  The broth they used tasted like cheap canned broth (I'm sure it wasn't but that's exactly what it tasted like).  Further more, the meat inside was also very bland and very SMALL...in that entire large dumpling the amount of meat inside was the size of the tip of your thumb.  I realize there needs to be room for the soup inside the dumpling but I mean...come on.  I had to put a butt load of that red garlic chili sauce they had at the table just to kick up the flavor.  I was extremely disappointed (-1).  

One of my friends is a vegetarian and she got some sort of veggie pancake that was actually a lot more flavorful.  Another friend got the lo mein with steak and I have to say that was the best lo mein I have ever had.  

Other than that, I don't plan on coming back to this restaurant for the soup dumplings but would come back for something else.  However, the quality of their claim to fame (the soup dumplings) needs to justify the ridiculous wait time...but it didn't.  Lame.",0
"This place is way too packed and way too popular. Most of their customers are white so I don't mean to be racist or prejudice in any way but the food was very ""americanized."" My group of friends and I stayed in Manhattan by time square so it was quite the distance to get to China town. We were expecting some authentic chinese food. 

 Right when we showed up the lady host said ""our party was too big and told us to wait 30 minutes."" Cool, it's chinatown so lets do some sight-seeing. We walked around and when we came back, 30 minutes later, she said I cannot seat you guys until you're whole party is here. Mind you that the dining area is about 1000 square feet and I have a party of 14. We aren't just going to come into the restaurant and stand around until you have a table ready for us. So the stand-off began. Half of my party was standing in the door way and the other half was standing outside. The host finally took our word for it and gave us 2 tables. The tables are really cramped and each one can fit only 6 comfortably; we had 14. 

 Onto the food: it was pretty decent. Just very americanized. If you are wearing a white shirt or an expensive shirt i advise you to eat the dumplings VERY CAREFULLY. Once you bite into one of their dumplings the juices will squirt everywhere. Their calamari could use some better battering(it was way too light and bland) and no honey walnut shrimp?!?! I substituted it with salty pepper shrimp and they actually clean the spines out for you here which is really impressive. And our flounder was cut up and deboned for us without asking. The tables aren't so big either so we got our courses 2 entrees at a time. Nevertheless we were stuffed and content with our food choice.",0
"I only got the soup dumplings but I thought they were only okay. They definitely held up during delivery which is key. The dumplings are big, they give you 8, and the skin is nice and thing. However, the soup inside is kind of weird - it's super thick and sticky, almost as if they pulled the fat off the top of a broth and stuck it in the dumpling. The flavor also isn't that impressive. Overall, I've had better but these were a decent option for takeout soup dumplings.",0
"We had 7 adults and 2 babies and were waiting for our turn. We waited an hr for the table when the host brought us inside to finally sit when she said I didn't realize you have 2 babies. We said we told you we did. We then waited another 30 min for her to find us a table and when she came out again she said oh another party was here and they have 9 people. They told us the other party didn't show when they were called so after 2 hrs we finally were brought inside. Now they said we have to wait another hr since the other party finally showed? Our babies were hungry and after 3 hrs of waiting all we got from the restaurant was a shssss ... very disappointed, staff is very unprofessional and disrespectful. We are never coming back.  It does not matter how good your food is, it is as bad a shit if your staff and service is the worse.",0
"Yeah, not a big fan. Though I have nothing really against Joe's and their food or service, I just find them to be a commercial story more than an interesting place to dine where NYC offers real indie Asian restaurant that were the inspiration for this place. Two stars for boring and unoriginal. Go to Shun Lee or hit some China Town unique spots in Yelp",0
"Joe's Shanghai isn't that special and their soup dumplings are good at best but normally OK only. I've tried a good portion of their menu, as my friend loves to take me here, and there's nothing special about it though you maybe surprise by a dish or two. For the most part we just stick with the soup dumpling and other items from the appetizer section and maybe the almond tofu dessert. It's quite crowded most of the time, especially at night, and if you come with a big group they won't seat you until everyone is here. If you come with a few people you may also get stuck being seated with other people on a big table. If you like waiting for a table, being seated in a crowded area and eating mediocre food then this place is for you.",0
"The first thing that irked me about this restaurant is that they sit you with strangers at the same table.  At a 10 person round table, they sat 4 different parties.  I've seen this before at Asian restaurants, but it made me a little uncomfortable eating across from a total stranger who kept glancing over at me.

As for the food, it was a good bang for you buck.  The food is very unique, and I recommend people try it at least once.  I thought the food was decent, but not a place I would want to frequent often...",0
"I'm really not sure what the hype is about. This place is mediocre, at best.

We went to the Chinatown location and were excited to try their famous xiao long bao (soup dumplings) only to be disappointed. The xlb's are a bit too big (making them unwieldy to eat), have too much skin, and the pork filling lacked flavor. We tried other dishes that were also nothing to write home about including the beef tendon noodle soup, scallion pancakes, yang chow fried rice, sautéed green beans, and general tso's chicken. 

Because we're talking about soup dumplings it has to be said... I'll take Din Tai Fung (the gold standard for XLBs, IMHO) any day over Joe's Shanghai. Period. (Unfortunately Din Tai Fung is not yet in NYC).",0
Probably one of the most over rated restaurants. Xiao long bao is ok - nothing spectacular. The rest of food is probably Panda Express grade. Ambience is pretty terrible and they don't take credit cards.,0
"The soup dumplings here are overrated because they are not very good especially when compared to Nan Xiang Dumpling House's. The soup in the dumpling was thick and gooey and the skin was too thick. I ordered the ones with crab and they did not have the usual crab flavor that you would expect - very disappointing! The seafood pan fried noodles were even worse because they didn't even use the right kind of noodles - the thin yellow ones that are very crispy when fried. Instead, they used these thick whitish noodles that tasted so bad that we didn't even want to finish them. I don't understand why this restaurant is so popular. I went for lunch on a weekday but it was still very crowded.",0
"Highly overrated in my opinion. I brought a friend here and talked it up so much based on the Yelp reviews and was pretty embarrassed afterwards.

The soup dumplings are not bad here, but I've tasted ding tai fung and it hands down has this place completely beat. In terms of other establishments in the vicinity, Shanghai Cafe had better soup dumplings in my opinion. 

Their dumplings here was a good bang for your dollar, but the meat didn't seem tightly packed together so had this sort of crumbly texture like it was shredding apart when I was eating it. Plus the soup had an odd sweet flavour note to it which I feel did not go well with the meat. I'm more of a salty and savoury kind of girl.

Not tragic but seriously overhyped, there's a better option so close by! Would never return here for that reason.",0
"Everyone talks so highly of this place and I had to check it out for myself.  I kept an open mind and tried not to compare it to the dumplings I've tried back in LA (Ding Tai Fung). 

The dumplings is what you expect it to be, full of soup in each and everyone of them.  I found the soup inside the dumpling to be lacking, it doesn't have the intensity and richness that should compel you drink it up.

I found this place good to try once due to the high recommendations, but that's it.",0
"This place is SUPER hyped up. So many features on different ""must eat lists"" but i was quite confused because I thought it was very average...

Overall, good soup dumplings. I'd just order a bunch of those and maybe a veggie dish (we got eggplant, which was very good). The other dishes are average, and you probably can skip. I'm sure you can find better noodle dishes in Chinatown.",0
"Meh. The soup dumplings were fine, but the noodle soup was a bowl of flavorless grease, what I imagine dishwater tastes like after soaking a stewpot all night.",0
"i dont know if most of the reviewers here have ever actually had an XLB from taiwan/china/HK before, but im guessing no because everyone rates this place so highly.  

the food here sucks.  the XLB is the only thing really worth ordering, assuming you can even stomach it.  is it better than not having XLB?  i guess some is better than none.  so go ahead and come here if you really desperate for XLB.

come to los angeles, and you;ll find better at over a dozen places.  but once youve tasted the stuff from the motherland, its just hard to stomach this place.  ive had it each time ive come to NY, and i keep walking out the door feeling like i wasted a meal opportunity.",0
"We ordered the xiaolongbao (both regular pork and crab), a scallion pancake, the cold beef appetizer and the beef with scallion. 

The xiaolongbao have thin skins that are prone to tearing. Some didn't have very much soup in them. The flavor was reasonable, but they don't compare to Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao in Flushing. The cold beef dish was pretty good.

The other two dishes were even less exciting. The pancake is very thick, so the crispy outer layer gets lost in a mushy center. The beef with scallion is your typical Chinese family style meat dish; no reason to come here for it.

The atmosphere is certainly an experience. Probably something you only want to experience once though. Sharing a table is slightly awkward, especially when both parties have too many dishes to fit on the table.

It's overhyped, but it's an okay option if you're in the area and don't want to trek over to Flushing.",0
"Came here today and it was just alright. Our waiter was speaking to us in multiple languages (english, mandarin and cantonese) a little bit of everything. Which got me confused on what language to respond with. We ordered the cold appetizer, squid which tasted bland as if it was bought from the supermarket in little pouches. We also ordered, 2 orders of crab and pork soup dumplings. In one of the dumplings, it still had pieces of shrimp/crab shell in it. The wrapping was a little thick for my taste. There were a lot of waiters but very unorganized on who takes care of which tables. Decor was nice, clean, bright and new. 

The BEST part yet, they automatically charge you ""service fee"" of 18% even if it was only for 2 people. Is this even appropriate to charge gratuity of 18% without the customer's consent? What if the restaurant didn't deserve that much? Would this consider robbing their customers?",0
It was a bit challenging finding this place because it was in the depths of China town. Let me go straight to the point! Very busy SMALL Chinese restaurant that's serves dumplings and several Chinese cuisine! Food taste good and price was reasonable! My only problem was the tables were so close to each other it makes you feel claustrophobic! Although the food taste good I only gave it 2 starts because I'm very very CRITICAL when it comes to CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Staff was rude in a way and when you're seated they rush to take your orders right away. The server we had knew little of the English language and he was very rude and aggressive. When the food was served not even 10 minutes you are given the check right away. It seems like they care more about your money than providing an extraordinary customer service experience. There are pictures of Celebrities around the restaurant who has been there before but don't be fooled because the service you will get will not be as close to those former VIP guest.,0
"I feel this place is hyped up and overly talked about, which is why people line up over an hour just to eat it. If you go as a party of two, you're most likely going to be sharing a round table with other parties. 

Food-wise the only thing I thought was good is the pork dumpling (xiao long bao). However, its very inconsistently made. Some of them fall apart and the soup comes out before you even put it on the spoon. Some don't even have broth in the dumpling. The crabmeat one tasted cheap and not clean. So again, I'd recommend getting the pork dumpling if you must come here. Theres other places that I think are a lot better. When you compare this to places in Asia, this place is mediocre at most. Even bigger chains like Ding Tai Fung (which is hyped up as well)is much much better and feels a lot cleaner than this place. Wouldn't come here again even if there weren't a line.",0
"Ok. So it WAS Christmas, but.... Seated is quickly at 930. Waited a while for waiter to take order.  Afterwords, our waiter went home at 10, presumably the end of the shift. Another waiter brought us some tea, and then I had asked him three times for water. The downstairs was not that busy in the upstairs had all the cleared out. We finally got our water, food was delivered. The food was not  Bad, but the same that you would find in many Chinese restaurants.  Our waiter brought us the bill which came to $20. We gave him $40 and ask for change of five dollar bills. Our waiter never returned and went about doing other things, another waiter had grabbed the tray of bills and change from the cashier and took  it in the back. When we came up to the cashier to acquire a better change they had no idea how much we gave or what are change was to be. We had to tell them as they had not expected to be giving us change. Would have been quite the tip on poor service.",0
"Maybe I came on one of their off days. My experience here was HORRIBLE....the only good thing that happened was the waiting time for a seat. That's it. It was about 10 minutes. For 2 people.

I came here with my boyfriend because many people have recommended this place to him. Raving about their soup dumplings...it was small and not up to standard. I even found a strand of hair in the lettuce underneath the soup dumplings... I've seen and tasted better than what I have had here. Shanghai Deluxe makes better soup dumplings than this place...

This place is so crowded....they don't even have tables for 2. We had to dine with 2 other couples.....People kept hitting my chair trying to pass through. My chest was pretty much touching the table....one of their waiters even had to stand between me and my boyfriend to let others pass.....

Now the food. We had the ""braised bean curd over spinach."" They gave an extremely small amount of spinach...is it because spinach is expensive now and they're trying to save food? Whatever the reason, it was way too little to have been served. Now the braised bean curd....it was bland beyond belief....I like bean curd (tofu) a lot, but this? Impossible to like....

Last but not least, the service charge......seriously??? I understand for a group of 6 and greater, but for 2?? Since this was a horrible experience for me (and I'm not coming back here), I didn't give them a penny more. I wish I didn't need to pay the service charge either....",0
"This place was highly recommended on Yelp...the food was good and potions were generous.  Dumplings plus two dishes were more than enough for three with plenty left over (general tso's chicken and Shanghai thick noodles).

Notice that there is a 15% service charge added to your bill already.  Also they brought a wrong rice dish to our table, we didn't notice and started eating it and then they came and took the dish away...who does that???",0
"I honestly don't understand what is the big fuzz about this place. Food-wise average across the line, customer service -1 stars and cleanliness 2 (there was mold in the bathroom sink). It says 11pm but we arrived at 10:20 and the server rushed us to order since they were closing the kitchen . 40 MINUTES before ""closing time."" If you are closing the kitchen more than 30 mins before closing time, SAY you are closing 30 minutes before! Not only that but they put us to dine with 2 complete strangers having more than enough tables available, really? One of the worst customer service experiences, all would've been forgiven if food was good! But no...unless you favor egg shells in your shrimp fried rice because that's what we got...a lot. Mmmm...delicious calcium supplement. All of this for $48? Plus credit cards not accepted and they include the service fee of 15% on your bill for only 2 PEOPLE. No thank you, NEVER ever going back to this sorry excuse of a Chinese...sorry Shanghainese...restaurant. What a joke. Yelp failed us this time",0
"The hype is not real. Soup dumplings are not mind blowing!! There are other places in New York that have cheaper and better ones. Nothing much to say, because they were not memorable at all.",0
"Stopped in for lunch with wife and girls. Great broth dumplings , tasty slurping. Rice and noodles were also good. They server family style a few plates can be shared amongst a few. Enjoy",0
"It's NOT all that great. Don't believe the hype.

Tip: Don't wait for more than 20min to be seated. It's not worth the wait. If you really want to eat the soup dumplings catch a train/cab to one of their other locations. It's the exact same dumplings but in a less hectic/crowded place.

The food was good. Soup dumplings were good. I'm just not convinced it's the greatest soup dumpling spot in NYC. I also don't think the hassle and the drama is worth it. 

Pro: Food is good. Prices are reasonable considering how popular this place is. 

Cons: Ridiculous wait times. Especially if you come during lunch/dinner hours. Trust me it's not worth the 40min to an hour wait time for a party of two. More people = longer wait.

 The seating system sucks. Chances are you'll be seated with a bunch of Tourists or the suckers that bought into the hype. If you are lucky they'll respect your privacy but so far that hasn't been the case with me. Maybe I'm just not that social.",0
"Came here on monday afternoon where the restaurant wasnt packed at all.. the person who greeted us also greeted another party and ask all of us to follow her which makes us very confused, normally other restaurant would seat one party at the time. Not complained about this, but could be more organized.
Like i mentioned, the restaurant wasnt packed at all but yet the two of us were seated in a very small table next to the stairway. The service was really slow, they ignored us for so long before taking our orders. The food came pretty fast though. We ordered the lotus cake, soup dumplings, salt and pepper pork and plain scallion noodles. All of them were very very very salty, fyi, i normally preferably to eat salty food but this is already wayy to salty even for salty food fan like me.
When we were eating, i dropped the chopstick by accident and one of the staff who stood not far from our table had an eye contact with me and saw me dropping it, but instead of quickly approaching me with a new pair of chopsticks, he was just ignore me until i have to wait some time to stop another staff who passed by to give me a new set of chopsticks. The server never come back to our table to asked how was everything, he was only simply come when taking our order (after a long time) and dropping check. I mean this place better of self service rather than having such staffs. I would never recommend this place to friends and its a no no coming back here.",0
"So, you can say I'm one of those fools who wait an hour in line to eat great food, and Joe's is one of those few places where I will give up my precious hour to satisfy my soup dumpling craving.  My wife and I have been coming here for 25+ years, and we have been trekking up from the WDC area a few times a year to drip our way to eat the famous soup dumplings. The dumplings have always been spot on and consistent, which is a primary key to a successful restaurant.   It has been over 3 years since our last visit due to the COVID pandemic, and we have final broke out of the shell to make it back to Joe's to devour the soup dumplings, and I must say, I am so heartbroken to find that the soup dumplings are NOT what it used to be.  The dumpling skins have become thicker, the soup taste profile is a bit off, bit into more crab shells than usual, the side dish sliced ginger is not thin, and the most noticeable is the size of the dumplings is larger.  Furthermore, the bamboo baskets are not lined with Napa cabbage, which makes the dumplings stick to the parchment paper.  Why am I complaining about the larger sized dumplings?  I did notice that there are considerable amounts of NEW restaurants that are serving the same style dumplings in the nearby blocks, and I can only assume that Joe's is feeling the competition.   With competition,  one will always try to do bigger and better.....  I have been in the restaurant business for over 40 years, and I can see that this is an initial sign of nervousness when they are met with fierce competition.  I've always preached that quantity will never prevail over quality in the restaurant business.  Quality will always create and increase repeat customers.  I am so so sad to see the negative changes at Joe's.  Unfortunately, last night at Joe's might have been the last.  It was great while it lasted.",0
"This is definitely not Din Tai Fung. Nor was it even close or similar to the DTF in Taiwan. I will give them props for being better than the DTF in Bellevue (Seattle suburb) since that one was horrendous. 

We stumbled across this location while we were wandering around Chinatown and noticed a line out the door. Any place with a line = I will stop and see what it's about. Lucklily for some odd reason there was only a 10 minute wait at noon on a random Saturday. Lunch #1 for me (after 3 Breakfasts that same morning). We sat down and ended up sharing a table with a really nice touristy couple. We ordered the crab XLB and the standard XLB.

Good amount of soupy broth but the meat and soup wasn't as savory as DTF in Arcadia or Taipei. The skins weren't as thin as I liked them but they were done pretty well for XLB options stateside. Solid 3 stars!",0
"I find it really hard to believe that the soup dumplings here are the best that you can find in New York.  I've been here twice now and would say that the soup dumplings are great, but not the best.  The pork dumplings are 3.5/5 and the crab dumplings are 2.5/5.  I'm not a fan of the crab dumplings because they smell a little fishy (yes, it's a shellfish, I know) and not as juicy as the pork dumplings.  

Pros: 
- Cheap juicy dumplings 
- The line goes really fast  
- Communal seating is a bit weird at first, but you quickly appreciate being able to see what other yummy things people are ordering. 
- Other dishes I've ordered here have been good and they seem to be willing to add/substitute stuff within the dishes per your request (e.g if you want chicken breast as opposed to sketchy, dark meat chicken). 

Cons: 
- Cash only ... although that's not really a major inconvenience 
- The downside of communal seating: Wait staff often confuse what you order vs. what other parties on the table order 
- Visibly dirty.  This place feels dirtier than the average Chinatown place.  I seriously feel like bringing my own utensils and water cup.  Bringing a germophobe here will not end well. 

Verdict: I'm a dumpling snob.  I like my dumplings looking all pristine when they come out, not all different sizes and different colors (hmmm... mystery meat?).  However, these dumplings are good, cheap and worth the wait.",0
Maybe it was all the hype.... The soup dumplings were good and I'm glad I tried it but nothing to die over.,0
Very lfew vegetarian options! However the wait staff was  attentive and our meat-eating friends seemed to think it was okay! Good serving sizes for sharing and a decent amount of seating - we got seated quickly even though there were 8 of us.,0
"I grew up in Shanghai, and I think the dumplings were okay-- a bit overrated, in my opinion. 

We also ordered a Shanghai Wide Noodles, and it was alright as well... average in quality, and not exactly a Shanghai delicacy. More of a simple, stir-fried noodles thing. 

Our third dish was a Celery & Tofu & Pork dish -- a classic Shanghainese home-cooked staple. That was pretty delicious, and just the way I remembered it! 

Portion sizes were very generous, which is nice!",0
"I went with huge expectations but was rather disappointed. The XLB was bland and had almost zero flavour. The Shanghai noodles and stir fried pork were okay but super salty, like a cheap Chinese fast food place. There are much better Chinese options in the area - Joe's is absolutely not worth the hype or the wait.",0
"Consistently good XLB (soup dumplings). It's what they are famous for, after all. I wouldn't order anything else on the menu if you are looking for good/authentic Chinese food...the other dishes taste like an afterthought - oily, hastily prepared, and overly salted. 

But the XLB...pretty worth the wait. I usually stake out a day to go on an empty stomach with the intention of getting 2-3 orders of XLB. Both the pork and crab ones are amazing, and $7-9 for 8 dumplings is a pretty good deal. The skin on these soup dumplings is pretty thick though, and the broth inside rich, if not a bit greasy. I needed a couple glasses of water to cleanse my palate afterwards. Still good if you're alright with that.

Note that this place is cash only, and the wait can be quite long, especially on weekend afternoons. While the restaurant itself is bigger than most, it still gets incredibly cramped - you'll end up sharing seats at large tables. Due to its popularity, I think Joe's can be good for the novelty and introducing people to XLB. It's like XLB for the masses. But there are Chinatown restaurants that serve XLB at equal or better quality AND serve other really good, authentic dishes.",0
"If you think the soup dumpling here is good, you should consider Xian house of dumplings in SF. Both are very delicious: the latter comes in a smaller/cuter size that you can eat it with one bite; the former comes with XL size and make you feel really satisfied with your dollar spent. The service is ok to terrible: the ok part comes with a 30-minute wait (which is fine if their food is actually good); the terrible part comes in when they serve me wonton with RAW/RED pork!!! Except for the food safety, everything else seems on the ok side.",0
"It's been a while since I've dined here, but thing I do not understand is why this place is a ""must-go-to"" on city travel guides and food shows. This place isn't bad in terms of their food, but it's extremely overrated. I mean, there's always a crowded of customers waiting outside the restaurant. Any local would be sane enough not to eat here. There are places such as Shanghai Asian Manor and Shanghai Asian Cuisine located in Chinatown that offer just as good or even far better xiao long baos without the long wait. 

The service here is typically what you'd expect from any restaurant in Chinatown. You tell the servers what you'd like and they bring it to you. Then you'd never see them again until it time to pay. 

Aside from the famous soup dumplings offered here, Joe's Shanghai also offers more ""traditional"" dishes such as wood ear, different types of Shanghai noodle dishes and appetizers/ small eats including scallion pancakes. 

Overall, I've only been to this place once and I'd never go back again. The hype sure is real here.",0
"I really like soupy dumplings but because of my allergies, there really wasn't any I could eat. It is in Chinatown so it pretty busy and crowded. Not sure if I will go back again. My friends enjoyed it though.",0
"Unfortunately this is my first one star review and it's only because i had some of the worst service i've ever had in the city. We sat at our table for about 15 minutes before someone came to talk to us. Then our food took another 45 until it came out. Waaaaaay too long considering the kitchen was fully staffed and the restaurant was pretty empty. 

After when we tried to use the restroom they told us that there wasn't a bathroom. then it was dirty. and then we could use it. Weird. No matter how good those dumplings were, we will not be returning.  0/10",0
"I was not impressed with the XLB here :( I wonder why it got such great reviews?! My husband enjoyed the Shanghai noodles though. Wish I had room to try the crab, which was recommended by my cousin. We order waaay too much XLB for two people. Get the pork + crab, tastes almost the same as the pork, and save room to try other things!",0
"So, I didn't actually eat here, even though there are a ton of positive reviews here on Yelp.. 

Why, you ask?

Well, the stench that greeted me from more than 10 feet away was unbelievable.  

Look, I KNOW it's Chinatown, but this was unreal!

The whole look and feel to the outside of the restaurant was very unappealing. Dirty and rundown.

LOOK, I know it's Chinatown!

Hey. How come there is no letter grade rating in the window? Don't all restaurants have to display that?

OH! There it is, next to the inner door in the vestibule...

I'd never even seen a C rating before!

Yuck.",0
"The food at this place tastes great. I've been going here for years, but it does have its flaws. It is crowded, dirty, and the ingredients are likely the polar opposite of certified organic. 

I've tried a lot of things here, but highly recommend the famous soup dumplings and the vegetable with bean curd.",0
"Pros: soupy dumplings are great, as is the crispy beef

Cons: wait + sharing tables + slightly over-hyped

In enjoyed dinner, but wasn't overwhelmed.  It's solid for it's signature dishes, but lacks the finish to be great.",0
"I guess I'm spoiled by my new found Chinese place in my hometown, The Bamboo House in Syracuse, NY. I thought this was good, but it wasn't as fresh and delicious. We had szechuan chicken and vegetable Lo Mein. Not super exciting I agree!  Not my choice either. I would try something else my next time through.",0
"We heard about the soup dumplings so on a whim, we popped in on a Friday night. The place was packed but we got a seat within 5 minutes. We had to share a table with two other couples which was a little awkward. The waiter came over right away and asked if we wanted soup dumplings and we said yes but had no chance to look at the menu. He put in our order and when we asked what else he recommended or what else was popular, he just kept yelling at us ""beef, pork or chicken!"" It was so unnerving and we almost walked out. The soup dumplings are good, but we wouldn't go out of our way for them. I also would never want to deal with that rude waiter again.",0
"Decent soup dumpling, not as good as it used to be. Packed with tourist. Cash only. Long lines. Plenty of waiters and waitress standing around.",0
"Bottom line first: The hype is not worth the wait, price, nor abuse.  Food was only so so. Since they write in a standard 15% tip, no matter the party size, they have no problem treating customers like crap. And they do. Looking at the crowd, this place got it's high ratings from Band-Wagon Zombie high star Yelpers.",0
"My coworker recommended this place for XLB, and I was intrigued by the amount of reviews this place had. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a weekday, and we were able to be seated right away. The service was quick and attentive. We ordered the pork meat soup dumplings, as well as the crab and pork meat soup dumplings. The crab and pork meat soup dumplings had a flavorful and delicious broth, though I wish that the wrapper was softer and thinner. The meat filling was also huge and overwhelming. My boyfriend and I were not a huge fan of the pork meat soup dumplings because the broth was too fatty for our liking. Kind of a let down because we were excited to try XLB in NYC Chinatown for the first time while visiting form California, but it doesn't compare to SF Chinatown's XLB.",0
"The soup dumplings (pork or shrimp) were good. But I'm not necessarily head-over-heels going gypsy over them. 

The scallion pancakes were really good; tastey, warm, and crispy.",0
"Let's start off with five stars and do the deductions from there.

-2 for cleanliness:  It's Chinatown yes, but let's face it, the space is not huge, it wouldn't take much to clean it.

-2 for the insanely rude, arrogant, and immature hostess:  Let's see....where to start?  Playing with hair in a restaurant - check.  Playing with your cellphone in front of customers -check.  Throwing menus at customers and saying nothing but ""share table"" - check. 

So we're at one star, right?

+2 for the soup dumplings, but, they are NOT the best.

Cheap meal, above-average food, but this is hype beast in full mode.

Did I mention the hostess sucks?",0
"The famous soup filled dumplings. Tasty but super rich and salty. I couldn't help but think about the fat content. 
Ok for everything else we ate, but over hyped in my opinion.",0
"So after reading all of the awesome reviews, I had to give these soup dumplings a try. When we walked up there were people waiting outside and we were worried about getting a table, but they got us in immediately. Sure we had to sit at a large round table with other small parties but I didn't mind at all. We started with the famous pork soup dumplings and I really didn't understand them. I thought I was going to get soup with dumplings in it, not dumplings with soup in them! Either way, I loved the ginger soy dipping sauce. Overall, I realized that I just am not a dumpling person.

I also had the orange beef which was delicious and my husband had the salt and pepper pork. The pork came with a special salt mixture that you put on it and it was really tasty. Overall, the food was good, but I have had better. It was a great night in Chinatown, but I bet there are better hidden little gems out there.",0
"I really don't get what's the big deal about Joe's Shanghai. My friend took me there cause she heard it is ""sooooooo good"" but seriously, I didn't like any food that I had there. The soup dumplings were disgusting. The meat stunk of something unpleasant. The noodle soup wasn't that great either. It is overcrowded and I just cannot enjoy food with distraction like thousands of waiters staring at me. 
I know where to go for my dumplings... definitely not here.",0
"**THE XLB REALNESS**

Joes Shanghai is to Din Tai Fung as Popeye's is to (insert $$ soul food restaurant fried chicken here).  I understand why someone might ENJOY Popeye's MORE but there's absolutely no way it's ""better"" or ""higher quality"".

FACTS:
- Joe's is much juicier than DTF
- Joe's skin is much thicker than DTF
- Joe's other dishes besides XLB are very mediocre (not terrible, but not great whatsoever)

Din Tai Fung is very refined and sophisticated compared to Joe's.  So it depends on your palette really.  But 95% of real Chinese foodies will take DTF over Joe's.",0
"*** BUG ON THE WALL OF THE BACK TABLE *** so discomforting to see while eating after waiting over an hour to be seated at a table full of other strangers. Very loud and crowded restaurant with too many tourists and rushed service! The food was incredible but service, atmosphere, and seating is below average. Joes is a favorite but this was so disappointing as they brushed it off and pretended it didn't happen after nearly 5 minutes of us trying to get their attention to remove it.",0
"I have been here more than a few dozen times over the last decade, and the quality has definitely gone downhill.  Here's what you can expect:

1. LONG lines/wait at almost any time of day/week.  I have gotten lucky during the day on a weekday, but even then can be a long wait.
2. You often will be seated at a shared table.  I have never had a problem with this, but it should be noted, since I have been seated next to people who are angry the whole time they are sitting with strangers. 
3. The service will be spotty.  You don't really have just one server.  At least a few different people will approach your table, depending on who it is, you will either be helped greatly, or you will be forgotten and you just need to tell someone else what you want.
4. You will usually be offered to start your meal with the dumplings.  DO THIS.  This is usually the only reason why people show up.  Place the soup dumpling on your spoon, poke it with your chopstick so that the soup drips into your spoon, drink the soup, then eat the dumpling.  Extra points for next spilling any on your plate.  This takes practice.
5. The food is generally served in large portions, which is fine with me!  I usually take home leftovers, and order to share with my group.
6. BRING CASH.  You cannot pay with a credit card.  Tip is actually included in the total, so watch out for that too, because you have to look at the receipt to notice this (no one tells you).

If you are looking for other good soup dumplings, I prefer Shanghai Cafe, where the service is better, it is less crowded, and an overall more enjoyable experience.",0
"The food are bad so I only took picture of the soup dumpling, the only dish that I like lol Would have been a 1 star if not for the soup dumpling. 

~ Pork Meat Soup Dumpling 小籠湯包 (3.5/5) ~
It's a good Chinese style soup dumpling, generous portion, a lot of yummy soup inside. The dumpling is on the thicker side (which is the way it is in China), it's not bad but I prefer Taiwanese style with the thin and smooth dumpling skin (like din tai fung). 

~ House Special Glazed Crispy Chicken 炸溜子雞 (1/5) ~
We asked the server whether Crispy Chicken in Ginger Sauce (脆皮油淋雞) is 炸子雞 (which is a crispy skin chicken) and he pointed us to House Special Glazed Crispy Chicken (炸溜子雞), which turns out to be wrong. I mean he speak Cantonese how can he not know what is 炸子雞 ? Lol 
After the dish was served we were shocked, but accepted the dish nonetheless. It is SO WEIRD. It's sweet & sour pork but the chicken version. We have never had a chicken version before and it felt SO WRONG. We grew up with the pork version, which is like 99% of what are served in Hong Kong. Plus it's a bit too sweet, and the fried chicken is quite dry and not tender. Maybe a foreigner would love and devour this dish, but not us. 

~ Buffalo Carp Fish Belly in Brown Sauce 紅燒鯇魚腩 (0/5) ~ 
Worst fish I have ever had in my entire life!!!!!!! It has a super strong stinky, smelly, fishy taste, it's revolting! For god sake did they not use ginger?!?!?! It's outright inedible. Did not touch the fish after few bites I just can't. 

~ Sautéed Seasonal Vegetables 清炒時菜 (2/5) ~
Stir fry vegetables is a basic Chinese dish but this is not done well. Vegetables used were odd, not the typical ones you'd get. The sauce is very runny and oily. 

Will I be back? No
Did not enjoy any of the dishes we got (except for the soup dumpling). Perhaps there are other dish that are good, but I'm not paying my own money to find out by trial and error.",0
"I'm not crazy about this place. 

Every non-Chinese/ non-Asian friend of mine who thinks they know something about Chinese or Asian food always suggests or brings me here for soup dumplings (xiao long bao). Then they try to show off their knowledge by explaining to ME what it is and how to eat it - Uh, sorry bud, I've been eating AND MAKING these by HAND since I was a kid- my dad was born in Shanghai. We take dumplings seriously. You get a ""B-"" for effort. ;-)

It was a much more decent haunt when I was a teenager in the 90's- from what I remember, that was when the press started blowing them up. Even an old friend and classmate of mine (who is now a curator in PS 1) swore by this spot, when we were teens. 

What can I say? I liked it after the first try in the 90's. Then after the second, I started to get bored. Then the third. Then the fourth. How often can you eat hyped up xiao long baos? Not that often. Better to go to #9 Chatham (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hop-shing-restaurant-new-york#hrid:SKgegYilESYPRg1u5u8eBw), and get some dim sum and get some xlb's in Flushing. I'm listing this spot as one of the many Americanized hyped up spots in Chinatown-. Even though the xiao long boas are still Chinese tasting, it's the same vibe as going to one of these guys: Wo Hop (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wo-hop-restaurant-new-york#hrid:F-sVFNFgkDCUC2bnCXDG7Q) and Hop Kee (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hop-kee-new-york#hrid:ctrmjxSMFCBVZW7bJ8WRGA). 

This place is a bore and a bit too American touristy for my taste.",0
"I understand why people like this so much but for me the dumplings just don't live up to the hype. Or maybe it's that I'm not a huge fan of soup dumplings and prefer my dumplings stir fried. Either way, I still like this restaurant for its other food and have found my previous visits to still be quite good. I've been here a few times over the years and each time I find myself a little underwhelmed with the dumplings.",0
"We're changing the review. Went over to check it out 10 months later and they now have an ""A"" sanitation rating. We tried to get in for lunch but it was very busy.  At 2:30 in the afternoon, the place was packed. My only complaint is the way they sit people, we had a group of five, and we couldn't get a table because they kept filling up the tables with groups of one or two as they walked in the door. After about 20 minutes of just waiting, it gets old watching all the people walk in and sit in front of you, but we understand it's New York and they need a quick turnaround.
We're looking forward to eating here again and giving them a better score when we can actually get in to try the food.",0
"I've heard so much about this restaurant, so when we were in the area, we just had to visit. The wait for a table wasn't as bad as I expected. But then I understood why; Each table sits three groups of two, so you have to share your table with strangers.

We started with the Scallion Pancakes which were delicious. If you like Scallion Pancakes, I definitely recommend the ones from here. 

We then shared the Jumbo Prawn In Citrus Flavor from the chef's special menu. I thought it was very good. The portion was big enough for the two of us to share. We also ordered the Shanghai Fried Flat Noodles, but I wasn't a big fan. They were more like Udon noodles and I don't think that they went with the jumbo prawns.

Service was quick. Our waiter was nice and knowledgeable about the menu.

I'm glad that we got to try Joe's Shanghai, but I don't think it's a place that I'll be longing to come back. The restaurant was too crowded and rowdy and I felt like there was a lot going on around us (like workers bumping into us while taking out boxes, and staff talking loudly over our shoulders). The food was good, but nothing that I will HAVE to come back for.",0
"mediocre. mediocre. mediocre. mediocre.  
 
Came to visit from the high volume of ratings. Sorely disappointed. Service was meh. Had way better Xiao-long bao. This was our first experience of having to share tables with other parties which we do not mind at all. This place is a joke. The other dishes that we ordered were the singapore chow mai fun and the prawn and scallop in garlic sauce were also so-so. I HOPE THE REST OF THE CHINATOWN RESTAURANTS ARE NOT THE SAME.  
 
Tourist, dont waste your time here. OVER-hyped.",0
Really sucked.  Was going to be 35 minutes for the Peking Duck so we ordered the crispy duck.  Not great.  Only came with a bowl of white rice which we had to ask for 5-10 minutes after the duck.  Seemed pork soup dumplings where doughey and somewhat flavorless.  Cash only was also a turn off.,0
As a Shanghainese this place is really just A-OK. Can get wayyyyy better stuff for a wayyyyy down price.,0
"This place is definitely overrated. Order soup dumpling for my lunch base on good reviews, but very disappointed. The soup dumpling taste terrible, by no way it could be one of the best soup dumpling in NYC. The dumplings were too thick, the pork meat inside were not fresh at all. 
I was order based on the Yelp menu, I was very surprise when it came out to be $6.80 after tax for the pork meat soup dumpling, and they accept CASH ONLY.",0
"Location: There are so many stores around Pell Street. Last time, I tried Hand pulled noodles. And now, I am here trying some real chinese food with my parent.s The store is unexpectedly tiny. They asked people to table together. So be prepared that someone violates your privacy during your time at Joe's
The wall has many pictures, trying to show off how great they are.

Food: we can xiao long bao. Celery with tofu, and one of their fish signiture food.
The food is very.. too oily for people who enjoy salad all day long to eat. 
But the taste is alright.

Service: is a mess.

THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH.

BAD
3.5 stars",0
"Joe's Shanghai full of crowds is misleading; there were barely locals eating there, mostly tourists who eat there biased from the good google or yelp ratings.

The xiao long bao is too big of a dumpling; normal dumpling size is much smaller and you can enjoy the juiciness. 

So this is a disappointing experience overall.",0
"I spend my childhood in Shanghai, therefore, I have had my fair share of xlb.  I have been to them all, from the touristy place in Yu Yuan to the expensive Ding Tai Feng located in Xing Tian Di, and the numerous cheap no name mom and pop style shops dotted through out the city.  This and sheng jian bao are the two food items that I missed the most about Shanghai and they are also the hardest to recreate by outsiders.  Bourdain was right, you can't find anything more perfectly constructed than a good xlb.    

Joe's xlb was very juicy, even juicier than some of the ones I had in Shanghai.  The skin needed to be thinner, but it wasn't so thick that made me question whether I am eating a xlb or just a northern style dumpling.  The filling was also quite tasty with a good texture.  However, Joe's xlb had one fatal flaw.  The soup inside the bun was distinctively chicken rather than 100% pork.  Its not that chicken broth is not tasty on its own, but the flavor of Joe's xlb deviates so much from the authentic version that it didn't quite satisfy my craving after I ate it.  I suspect that its much easier to make a gelatin broth from chicken carcass and chicken feet rather than the labor intensive process involve cleaning and scraping pork skins.  The other stuffs in the restaurant are probably not worth ordering since I saw many tables had the gloppy American tourist type Chinese food.",0
"Honestly, this place is a tourist trap. I think their soup dumplings are dry and not as flavourful as I had hoped. I do remember though when I was younger they use to make better ones and it was cheaper. Now it's expensive and overrated. Better off finding a hole in the wall for soup dumpling these days.",0
"I have been to this place several times. While visiting NYC in Sep 2018, I brought my family here and I won't be going back. Their dumplings are ok and I would say maybe below average. Dumpling skin is too thin to hold anything so it breaks easily. I also had fried dumpling and it was too oily. There are definitely better options out there in NYC. 


Cash only.",0
"This was the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten, except for the soup dumplings.",0
"Are u serious to give 5 starts for this trash restaurant? Food is OK. Service is garbage. Cash only. Tip is already included for every single bill regardless u asked or not. Just backing fire on travelers for easy money rather than working on better service and food. Please try other chinese restaurant before u have all NYC restaurants, please.",0
"I thought this restaurant was overrated... It's located in the center of Chinatown in Manhattan and attracts mostly tourists looking for what they assumed as ""authentic Chinese food."" The restaurant is overly crowded to fit as many tables as they can in the limited space. Service was not impressive.. Your typical Chinese waiters. 

Good wise, we had 2 different kinds of soup dumplings: crab and pork. They weren't spectacular but weren't bad. We also had fried pancake which was pretty bland. That's about as Chinese as you get. Rest of the menu are your typical Chinese American items like general tso chicken etc.",0
"Went here with two other people for dinner last night. We shared all dishes, and agreed that this was one of the worst meals of our lives. Out of seven dishes, only the cold sesame noodles were good.

Boiled pork dumplings- Gummy, spongey dumpling wrapper like those on cheap frozen supermarket dumplings. The filling was spongy and tasted off, like the pork had been frozen and thawed many times. It also exuded a rancid tasting grease.

Soup dumplings - Soup filling tasted like hot garbage.

Seasonal Vegetable - Bok Choy was cold, wilted, and drenched in oil. Asked for dish to be prepared 'hot and spicy', but it was completely bland.

Singapore noodles - The shredded chicken was dry and gummy, tasted like cardboard, and stuck between your teeth. The noodles tasted like the inside of an old curry jar. The shrimp was completely inedible.

Sesame chicken - Edible, but barely. Completely shellacked with an overly sweet sauce. Felt like I was eating candied meat. 

The worst part of all of it was the price, which was exorbitant given the quality. I would never eat here again.",0
"Come 'on folks.  Those jiggly little soup dumplings that this place made press for are available at any Chinese restaurant that serves this region.  I've been to many a Chinese restaurant in my lifetime and even the little hole-in-the-wall places can execute this dish correctly.  That said, this place is still yummy, but definitely not original.   Don't make yourself crazy waiting in line when you can have your appetite satisfied in many other places in the area.",0
"FYI they are cash only!! There was also an 18% service charge.

We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings, shrimp fried rice and pepper duck. The dumplings were good, but the shrimp fried rice and duck were only okay. We had to ask for sauce for the duck because even with the seasoning and lemon it had no flavor.",0
"My 1st trip to the Big Apple to see the other half would not be complete without a trip to Chinatown.  We actually went to C'town for cupcakes but we though we'd get dinner too.

The 2 of us got there a little after 5pm but the restaurant was already quite busy.  We had to share a table with others even though there were still empty ones that did not get filled by the time we left.

The soup dumplings were very good with the wrappers being just the right thickness.  The filling was on the salty side but there was plenty of hot soup on the inside (caution!!).  The clams in black bean sauce was also a bit salty but it went well with rice.  The best thing about the dish was that the clam-meat-to-clam-shell ratio was close to 1:1.

The chief complaint - and the major reason for star deduction - was the poor quality of service.  We had ordered rice with our meal but it took 2 additional attempts to get them.  I was actually actively ignored by some of the waiters!!  They were quite snooty to us compared to the way they treated the Mandarin-speaking customers that were sitting across the table. I didn't know I had to ""prove"" that I am Chinese enough to get equal service.  If I had known, I would have spoken to the waiters in both Mandarin AND Cantonese.

The food was good (but I suspect better options can be found elsewhere in C'town) but the terrible service just overshadows it all.  We probably won't be returning to Joe's again unless we were really craving some soup dumplings.",0
"Not the best option in the area. Decided to get take out from here this evening. For $20 I got the beef and broccoli. Words can not do the portion size justice. I got a 1/4 of a large container and like 3 spoonfuls of rice in the same container. So less than half of the container had food. I had really high expectations for this place. For $20 the food tasted average and the portion size made it completely a three time experience...... The first, the last and the never again. Hopefully someone will chose better than I did. McDonald's came in clutch tonight.",0
"Service was awful!!! Waited for an hour but didn't get to try their food due to human needs. Yes, I understand we were a big party of 10 (which included 4 seniors) and to top it off was Friday night 8pm so we knew we had to wait. We come from Los Angeles and was looking  forward to Chinese. We were given number 32 on a raffle ticket  and estimated time 20min. We took advantage of the wait time and decided what we were going to eat. At 8:30pm I took this picture notice how I aim up to avoid all the heads of waiting people thinking soon we would be called. After the picture taken of the front entrance I go inside and ask how much longer since we have 4 seniors (in laws 71yrs, 68 yrs., and two friends  73 yrs and 65yrs) women says 4 numbers before you. Then after a min of me coming back out she says 30, 33,34,35. I was like what the heck?!?!! At this point I tell my husband to go ask how much longer. Maybe split tables? He comes back and they say 10-15min at 8:46pm. Two of the seniors decide they no longer want to wait so they opt to leave. At this point I decide to go find a place to go use the restroom  and and get something to drink since I didn't believe their estimated time. To my surprise the estimated time was a true and the women says all of you need to be here. My fiend explains that two left since the wait was too long and I was on my way back from toilet  and getting a drink (around the corner) little did I know I was shooting my self on the foot. The lady was MEAN, rude and had no compassion and simply called the next party on the wait list. My husband tried calling me and texted me but no luck my phone  had no more battery . My friend told her they knew what they wanted to order and that I was in my way back but restaurant host was rude and said ""no""  not all here while stomping feet . Please have in mind the majority of us was there. So from thinking we were going to be seated and being inside the entrance restaurant. The RUDE host ignored my family and rest of friends. Now our 1hour wait time was down the drain. My family hungry, tired and restless walking away from the restaurant since that I didn't pick up my phone and met them hauling ass to get back but they said too late they turned us away. I felt HORRIBLE  since it was my fault.  Waited for an hour and got turned away since not all present. I had no idea ‍ what their policy was.",0
"I'm sure many of you have already heard of this place, and it doesn't need too much introduction.  Joe's Shanghai is one of those places that I feel like defines Manhattan Chinatown.  This place is pretty packed at all times as well, and you should expect to wait if you're attempting to eat here.  Definitely come here an hour before you're actually trying to eat to put your name on the roster, and your wait time won't seem so bad because you can wander around the area and explore, making your otherwise boring wait in the middle of the alley not so bad.  While I hesitate to call this place a tourist trap, there will definitely be a lot of tourists there, as Joe's has made a name for itself and its famous soup dumplings.

Now, as far as the actual food goes, the traditional soup dumplings are definitely something you will want to try.  While I feel like your mileage actually varies based upon the day and how busy the restaurant is, they do do a solid soup dumpling.  I saw some of the food that other people had ordered, and it didn't really seem too remarkable.  I also had another order of crabmeat dumplings as well, which actually weren't as good in my opinion as the pork dumplings.

This place may not be the best place around, but it is established, and if you're not feeling particularly adventurous, Joe's Shanghai is an excellent standby location, and if you have never tried it, I think it's worth a visit if the line isn't too long so you can decide for yourself whether or not it lives up to all the hype.",0
"Okay so I heard great things about this place and yelp raves about this place so I went out of my way to check this place out. Got there and there was about a 30min wait, no problem - there's definitely a lot of things to do around there. The seating is with a group of people in a round table, it was pretty cool I must say.
Food is not that good to be honest. I was with my wife and dad and none of us enjoyed our food. Food is plain and nothing special at all. To top it off!!! The tip is already included ! A nice 20% regardless of what you order or how much you order. It wasn't worth the $$$. Wouldn't go back",0
"Overrated, touristy, terrible service, and not worth it.

I should have read the reviews more thoroughly here. I made the mistake of including tip on our meal.

Dumplings are interesting....but I wouldn't order again. Underwhelming. 
Having grown up with a mom that cooked with msg, I think there is a  lot of msg in their food. 

We didn't' have to wait in line, otherwise this would be a one star.

Waiters were like machines pushing a herd of people in-n-out for feeding.",0
"Craving for some Shanghaiese foods? This place might do it for you if you don't know much about authentic Shanghaiese foods. I'm 100% Shanghaiese so I know what and how it should be. 

Their xiao long bao is way too big! It is juicy indeed, but the flavor is totally off. All the other dishes are mediocre. I'm not saying I've tried all of it but giving this restaurant 3 shots is more than enough to know this is not authentic at all. Is it good? Yes. Is it authentic? No. 

They get really busy here so try not to come during peak hours as you'll be waiting forever. Get ready to share tables with strangers as the restaurant itself isn't too big. It is totally about the hype. Come and try it so you'll be able to tell everyone you've tried it.",0
"As a soup dumpling lover I've been to all three Joe's Shanghai locations- midtown, Chinatown and flushing. I will never return to this location, perhaps even all of them, due to poor customer service here. I walked up to the two hostesses and BOTH of them were preoccupied with playing with their nails. I had to greet them and asked them for a table for 2. Still playing with their nails and not making any eye contact, they told me there's a 60 minute wait. 

Their soup dumplings are mediocre, so is everything else on the menu. There are much better soup dumplings in close proximity with much better service. Don't let the high ratings fool you.",0
"If this is NYC's best raved about dumpling place, it's a bit disappointing. The experience wasn't bad but it's nothing to rave about. Just basic soup dumplings. It is better then some of the places I've tried in the area but nothing in comparison to Din Tai Fung's clean presentation, texture, and taste. 

Customer service was ehhh bad. They're rude but they got my food to me in a decent time so I guess I can't complain while in china town. Also they only take cash and have a 15% service charge so don't bother adding gratuity.  

Now that I'm in this area I'm trying to find new favorites.",0
"Very yummy soup dumplings, which is what I came here for. However, I discovered my favorite was actually their noodles (forgot the name, but there were vegetables in it). Absolutely delicious! Just wish I could've been seated at my own table instead of with strangers. The decor and service weren't good, but what can you expect from Chinatown?",0
"It's like a Chinatown tourist trap gone wrong... or maybe right, depending on how you look at it. First look, you see the people standing outside... waiting, and it's typically a 30 minute wait.. once you get in, it's community seating.. yep, you sit where ever  with whomever. Slurping strangers with bad eating habits and loud chewing is all part of the ""experience"".. 

After living in NYC for almost 10 years, I was forced by some friends to experience this gem and well, let me tell you... there are better places to go. 

Ok, lets get to it. Soup dumplings are meh, but again... they are at other places with better commutes and service. 
We ordered Dumplings, string beans and a few other dishes... and well, the chinese place down the street on UES serves better food, as it was bland and lacked much flavor. 

The waitstaff or people working here are close to rude... rushed and well, they're trying to turn the tables..here is a tip people.. walk around the corner on a nice day and you can get a plate of authentic dumplings for a dollar or an entire platter for $5 and you'll be full, the service is better at the counter and you wouldn't have wasted your time here standing in line etc. 

Look for soup dumplings elsewhere.",0
"I have no idea why this place has so many reviews and why people wait so long to get a table here. The good is super average and tbh white people bland. I took a group of my chinese friends with me and we all were shocked at how low the bar was. 
Typically when you sit down u get offered tea in any traditional chinese restaurant. Also it's almost inevitable you can order chow fun.. first time i don't see chow fun on a chinese menu?!  Then we had to beg to get rice with dishes that come with it. Horrible service and just not worth it. There are far better places I have been to in Chinatown",0
"I've been here twice. During my first time a couple years ago, I thought these dumplings were the best of the best. However, during my second time (going for lunch this time), I wasn't very impressed. Yes, they were still soupy, but the soup wasn't that good. It's still a must try if you haven't yet.

JONASAPPROVED!",0
"Came here for the xiao long bao like everyone else. They are pretty good. Definitely the juiciest XLB's I've ever had. There's so much soup in that dumpling, I don't even know how it doesn't pop! I also tried one of their noodle dishes, it was whatever. If you want some juicy, soupy, xlb's come here.",0
"Came here in June with some friends. The food was okay -- there are a lot of better places in Chinatown. Not sure what all of the hype is about. 

On the particular night we went, the waiter kept rushing us to leave which was annoying and a bit rude. I understand you want to go home, but the place isn't even closed yet. I understand some people stay past closing and that's a hassle for the staff but it wasn't even closed yet.",0
"Eh. I don't get the hype. This is definitely one of those places that are famous for being famous...the Kardashian of the food world. 

Nothing that stands out about this place. While it is a nicer Chinatown restaurant, the food isn't better than other Shanghai places and nothing really shines here. Everything is just eh. Save your money and head down the block to Shanghai Garden. You'll get more for your money and your tummy will thank you.",0
"Having been a longtime customer of Joe's, I felt I've had enough meals there over the years to notice a downward trend. 

the chef who makes the soup dumplings must have left recently (within the past 2 years) because the flavor of the broth and the wrapper of the dumplings are significantly different. The wrapper texture is now thicker and puckers more out of the steamer. And the crab meat dumplings -- something is seriously wrong with it. Not even the vinegar and ginger could save it.

In our most recent meal, we got the subgum rice cakes. It was OK -- not much different from any of the other Shanghai places in Chinatown or Flushing.

I agree with other reviewers: The Joe's in Flushing is about 25% percent better. At least I don't have to share tables or get charged an automatic 15% tip there.",0
"i'm not gonna lie, i did enjoy these soup dumplings (and may be a bit tardy on the hype with joe's). my friends and i have casually dropped by at least 3 times so far and i've tried their pork and crab dumplings. the soup is on point and precisely the way a taiwanese soup dumpling should taste. the only detail that bugs me out is that they took authenticity to the max. the servers are obnoxious, low key, and borderline rude. they didn't expect my friends and i to inhale four orders of crab soup dumplings..and then some. our server repeated three times that the serving size is 8 pieces per order. we savored our meal to the final piece and deliberately ordered another two, which sent two of the young turds sniggering. whatever, who cares. we laughed at ourselves too. but yeah, if the authentic ""chinese dining experience"" is what you're going for, then be my guest. situated in the back alleys of chinatown, it is decently priced albeit personally, i'd rather sit at home and make my own 8 batches of soup dumplings. it's the cheaper bet.",0
"Tourist trap! There was nothing special about the food here. It tasted like a typical Asian buffet, there was nothing special about the food here. Long wait times as well",0
"First off, two heads-up for any potential diners: (1) You will only be seated you if your whole party is present and will most likely be seated at a shared table with other diners and (2) They are CASH-ONLY so be sure you are bringing enough Benjamins with you if you plan on ordering lots. 

Joe's Shanghai has been on my NYC To-Do list for a while and I was excited two weekends ago when I finally got to cross it off. That excitement quickly simmered down once I started eating. This place should be really reviewed based on the merits of its food, since I can say the prices are reasonable, the service is solid, and the atmosphere and seating is expected - it's a popular Chinese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown so expect it to be noisy and crowded. 

So, the food...

To be honest, I may have set my expectations too high when coming here. All my friends told me this was the go-to place for soup dumplings and I have been dying to try it. For the meal, we ordered two steamers of soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Kung Pao Chicken, Mapo Tofu, and noodle soup. The focus of this review is probably going to be on the soup dumplings; the other food was solid, fresh, and good but fairly average compared to this restaurant's peers in the area. 

Soup Dumpling Soliloquy:

So I am by no means a soup dumpling expert, but there are a few things I like to see when I eat one. There has to be a well-made casing to hold in all the soup, the broth should be flavorful, and the filling should really accentuate all three together into one very satisfying bite. 
Joe's Shanghai kind of delivered on all of this. Kinda. The casing was fine, the broth had some taste, and the filling...tasted like filling. So it was a decent dumpling, but I fail to see where all this hype is coming from. I guess the food was hot so that's a plus and the wait to get in wasn't too long, but for me this definitely ended up being just a checklist experience - something so that I can say I've been to Joe's Shanghai. There are lots of places to get quality dim sum around Chinatown, and not that this place was bad by any means, but I would probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. 

tl;dr 95% chance this place is overhyped, 5% chance I had just had an off experience. Food is fresh, but average",0
"I haven't been here in years but it seems it has became popular through out the years. I am very disappointed in the awful service I received. My uncle from out of town was visiting the city for my brothers wedding. He hasn't been here in a few years and was craving Joe Shanghai's water dumplings. So we got here at 5 and got a number. We were a party of 9 and because we were a large group many of us were coming from different places and was not there yet. They refuse to seat us even though there were 2 people missing. When we finally all arrived, they told us there were no tables for us. We waited for another 45 mins and constantly asking asking the lady when will the table be ready. She would rudely ignore you and keep screaming numbers in our faces. They could never give us an approximate time on when they could seat us. My family and I ended up leaving and going to another restaurant. I will NEVER visit this place again and never will recommend this place. When they get their head out of their ass maybe I'll consider this place. Joe Shanghai, you're not that special. Get over yourself!",0
"Last time I went to Joe's Shanghai (granted, quite a few years ago) They added a tip to our bill without notifying us, and then the manager got angry when we noticed and wanted it refunded as we had left one at the table. There are other better, more honest, and and less touristy places to get Shanghai dumplings in the city.",0
"Nothing special order pan fried noodles chow mien (it wasn't what I expected, noodles were different) and pork dumplings they added 15% service charge ($20 is expensive for what you get) and provide minimal service I wouldn't go again",0
"This place is completely a tourist trap. Food is nothing like the original Shanghai recipes. If I could give Zero star I would. The line for the table can only be described as like in a concentration camp. The only different between them is  in a concentration camp you will eventually get some decent food and be satisfied whereas in JS you would pay through your nose and be well pissed off (avg waiting time is 2 hrs). If you really like oriental food then do yourself a favour walk a few yards  towards the main china town there are plenty of decent restaurants and the prices are much reasonable and most of all the quality of food is MUCH better.  Only the restroom is the only thing I would come back for.   The restroom is spacious and relatively tidy and clean compared to average NYC restaurants and food establishments. 

:-(",0
"Disappointment! We thought we were lucky to get a table bc it was a rainy day but the food was horrible. The only thing that was ok was the pork soup dumpling but even that was stretching, they all fell apart as we were picking them up...that still worth 2 stars but the rest of the food...Shanghainese wonton, chicken vermicelli were horrible.  The wontons were so salty we only ate a few n left.  Joe Shanghai...what happened to you?!  I'll not be back.",0
"The best way to describe my situation would be that I had actually made a reservation for Joe's for 12 people for 7:00pm on a Saturday night, they were gracious enough to actually allow the reservation. She only said that we should all arrive on time or they will give it away. I asked for the grace period and she had informed me 10 minutes. 

Of course, not all my party shown up promptly, the last person to show up was 7:07pm but she had actually gave away the table not honoring the time slot and we had to wait 30 minutes to get the next big table. Originally I was going to give the place 2 stars but garnered the additional star was the waiter who served us that night. He made up for the lack of customer courtesy at the door with a good personality which is often not available at a Chinatown restaurant. 

The food is amazingly well prepared and fast served. The soup dumplings are amazing and addictive as well. The pan fried noodle dishes I enjoy every time and consistently good. The scallion pancakes come in a good size portion and the dipping sauce is a sweet soy sauce. Overall, we weren't rushed out and I think it was because we just kept ordering beers all night so the owner must have been OK with our straggling at the end. 

I'd return again, but understanding that it's best to go and wait. You will wait, because it is such a crowded restaurant. The food though is worth it and you know you'll be out in under an hour.",0
The food is great. Xiaolongbao is perfect. My main concern is tat the staff is extremely rude and disrespectful. If ur not anyone important you will be treated like trash.,0
"Fresh soup dumplings.  Prices are very reasonable.  15% tip is built in so not much thinking to do on your end.  No credit cards taken. 
Service is pretty proforma.  They're attentive, but you'll notice it's to move you along, not cater to your needs.
I've been to three locations.  The midtown location is more upscale. 
On Friday evening in Chinatown the line was assembled in the street I assume to enjoy primarily their XLB...they definitely enjoy a following.",0
Long wait to sit... But fast food service. Dumplings are not that good... Especially compared to Din Tai Fung...,0
"TLDR: Order the soup dumplings
Joe's Shanghai is a New York city staple and infamous for their soup dumplings and similar dim sum dishes. I ordered their pork soup dumplings as an appetizer (they are definitely big enough to share between two people). The are delicious, juicy and perfectly spicy. I highly recommend coming here if you're in the mood for a satisfying soup dumpling. However I give the restaurant experience a 3 star review because of the lack of attention to other dishes. Their noodles (pictured below) desperately needed to be cooked more thoroughly and flavored better.",0
"This has been my third or fourth visit here. And every time I've come here, I always get some xiao long bao and pork fried dumplings and some chicken or vegetable dish. And each time I come, the more I think that this place is a bit overrated. Yes, the first time I tried their xiao long bao, I thought this place was the best place EVER. I had never tried xiao long bao before and I wanted more and more and more. But now that the excitement from my first experience died, I can truly see and taste the actual quality of the food... Take a bite of the dumpling and look into the soup.. there are chunks and chunks of fat floating around. Let drops of the soup sit on your plate for a couple minutes... it coagulates and looks disgusting. But maybe I'm thinking about it the wrong way. It's still delicious... But I just can't help but notice the gross things... Now I pour or half of the soup and pour in spoonfuls of the ginger/vinegar sauce [which is DELICIOUS]. 

The pork fried dumplings are GREAT. Yes, a bit greasy because it's fried, but I love the thick dumpling skin. And the vinegar/ginger sauce complements it quite well. I just love that sauce. But I just love vinegar in general. haha. 

This place is overall pretty decent. I would suggest going to the Joe's Shanghai in Flushing though. That one is MUCH better. I feel like the soup in the dumplings were less fatty. And the crab/pork xiao long bao are so good. They just melt in your mouth. So good.

Oh and don't be fooled... Tip is included in the bill. I almost missed that and double tipped... whoops.",0
This place had poor service a B rating and gave me diarrhea. The food taste and flavors was not anything out of the ordinary. I wonder if their likes were bought.,0
"Terrible service!!! Went today and they weren't even very busy. Ordered before several tables around us ( they pack you in like sardines, even with so many other tables free) and the other tables were finished or at least eating and we didn't receive anything. Waited 35 min and not even a dumpling. I asked how long and the man said it was coming. Another 10 min and still nothing. How long does it take for steamed dumplings, especially when everyone around us ordered and received theirs. Too many places to go in NYC to be treated so unpleasantly.  Think again before choosing this place. The ambiance was expected... definitely a dive but their reviews brought me here and I can't say anything about their food since I didn't receive it.",0
"The soup dumplings are the star of the show, but if you come on a night when Joe's Shanghai is so busy that the dumplings are not cooked properly, the place loses its main attraction. The supporting cast needs to perform better. Reviewers have commented on the service, which we also found lacking. It wasn't always bad, but the waiters and hostesses seemed more hurried, and come off as uninterested in the customer's experience. My wife and I visit Joe's three to four times a year. We tolerate the wait and the dining in close proximity to other patrons, because we really enjoy the crab and pork dumplings. We had dinner at Joe's last night and the first round of dumplings seemed over-steamed, with little or no juicy soup inside.And another thing, don't take my money, including a service charge then forget to bring me my change, as if this was a tip on top your service charge. Come on Joe, you can do better than this!",0
"What is the mass hysteria about this place. It's just another Chinatown restaurant that caters a dumbed down menu to a public who doesn't know any better.

The soup dumplings lacked depth of flavor and juiciness. There is better to be had to Brooklyn from past experience. 

Not saying the food tasted bad, it was just a gimmick rather than anything overly authentic. Tired of this sort of BS across New York.

Next.",0
"Waited to be seated for forever. Finally after being seated, we were stuck at a table with random people. Then people that were sat after us, were served first. What they don't mention while waiting 40 minutes outside is that they can't serve alcohol.",0
Over hyped in my opinion the food was very average. For hearing that it has the best dumplings in nyc i was pretty disappointed!,0
"Definitely do not see the hype with this place. This place is filled with mostly non-Chinese tourist. Well that explains the hype.

The wait wasn't bad but expect to be seated like you're going to yumcha with strangers because the place is small so you will most likely sit with strangers.

Got both versions of soup dumplings, cold sesame noodles, and scallion pancake. The only good thing was the pancake. The soup dumplings barely had soup in them and they both tasted the same - really bad, like expired meat or something. The noodles was bland too.

If you want to feel like a tourist then this is the place for you.",0
"I love me some soup dumplings!! Especially when California has a bunch of hole in the wall dumpling spots.

I heard all the hype around Joe's Shanghai so yes, I threw it on my itinerary and the boyf agreed. Came on a Thursday during lunch and was seated immediately. Cash only! 

We got the iconic Crab and Pork dumplings to share. 

I love the idea behind crab and pork, but the dumplings we had were legit the most doughiest dumplings I've had with lack of filling. I was shocked that THIS is what everyone was raving about. 

The dough was oddly dough-y. Way too much starch for my liking. Plus, they are pretty pricey dumplings and not that much filling to accompany it. 

Happy to have crossed it off my list, but nothing that made my toes tickle.",0
"Came here because of the high ratings on Yelp which explains the truck loads of tourists including myself. It really was not worth the 40 mins wait tbh. This place was already far from our Airbnb in New York so what ended up to be mediocre dumplings in a shady and smelly hood made it worse. I'm no expert when it comes to XLB and I don't have it often but XLBs famous to this caliber I really expected more. I think the only thing that stood out was the abundance of soup in each package. But when I think of crab I think of fresh, sweet and savoury. The brown soup that poured out was none of that. There was not much flavour and I told my boyfriend. He responded ""...but the vinegar compliments it so well."" Ummmm, if it can't blow my socks off on its own without a sauce to help... then it's really not that great. 

I was also creeping other people's dishes at my table (they are so packed here you gotta sit with randoms) and it's definitely not quality Chinese food. Would not revisit...",0
"We only had to wait about 10 min for our table. It was an experience... sharing your table with strangers. The food was great, particularly the soup wontons and scallion pancake. The service though was not... our waiter was kind of rude and when the bus boy was cleaning up the table he was leaning right over my husband where my husband had to move out of his way while he was eating. May be just a culture thing... but it was good food. Our next visit to NYC we will probably try another place though.",0
"Great dumplings! Very bad service and rude servers, the hostess stare at you like a ticking clock to make you eat fast so they sit the waiting customes outside. Loved the squid with salt and jalapeno pepper, well marinated. Okay place if you like sharing a table with strangers. Our server yelled at us so I yelled back my order- that shut him down. Restroom leaves something to be desired- soild and dirty toilet paper on the floor and hand dryer is as old as the paleolithic age.
I peeled into the kitchen and am sure it is not the most sanitary one, has a smell (not from the food) but a musty unclean smell

Second time 9/17 to eat here since the soup dumplings are amazing.
The male servers are good and attentive to the diners but the HOSTESS- the one who shouts for customers to come in is the RUDEST i have seen. Literally she is screaming at people and throwing the menu on the table and barks at people. Thankfully we finished our dinner , i saw 5 people almost walked out because of her. 
Told the lady at counter but not sure if she even understood what i said. 

Great eats, dirty restroom, RUDE lady hostess but at least good male servers.",0
"Skip all food except the soup dumplings. The soup dumplings are good. They are not the best quality but you are not paying much for them.

Ambiance: Well it's a Chinese restaurant that smells like Chinese Food, with large round tables covered with cloth tablecloths. Each table seats 8-10 people.

Service:  It's quick, and nothing fancy.  Know what you want when they come by or expect to wait.  They do seat you wherever there is space so expect to make some new friends by the end of your meal.

So I have to give them 3 stars for the value.  I definitely have had better soup dumplings in NYC (better meaning better taste and quality! try Liberty View in Battery Park for awesome soup dumplings).",0
"Perfect for a COLD Day (not the 90 degree day we went)!

Soup Dumplings were great and cheap.  

We got both the Pork and the Crab soup dumplings.  Not the BEST I've had but they were good and we were happy.  I prefer the Pork. The order was perfect for two people (Meal came out to around 15 dollars and we were full).  

Tip: Tables are shared, CASH Only.",0
"Dumplings were good but not amazing. Line becomes ridiculous in the evenings. Not sure what the hype is all about, but overall it was a cool experience.",0
"We had dined here numerical times. Every time when I visited New York China Town, this was my must go place. This time I noticed the food was not taste the same and the quality of the ingredients were not good. The fried rice was liked just mixing the meat with the steam rice. The rice noodle dishes tasted disgusting. What a disappointment. It's a shame to see one of my favorite place going downhill. This is a cash only place, be aware of what you ordered !!!",0
"Another must go to in my New York Trip.  I saw this in Facebook, and had to have it.

We went to Joe's right after walking from Downtown Manhattan to Brooklyn Bridge, and walked to China Town for brunch. So hubby and I worked on our appetite for sure.  We arrived around 11 am, we did not have to wait, but we shared a large table with a party of 7.  So that kind of cramped our style.

My husband and I ordered two Xiao Long Bao- Pork and Crab.  We also had the scallion pancake and an order of Mu Shu Chicken.  

I have to have a redo and maybe I would give more stars.  The party of 7 in our table ordered almost the same entrees as us, so the server was confusing our orders with them, and due to the cramp seating, I can't get comfortable with my eating. 

Over all it was good, but I must have a redo- next time.",0
Updated review: after our third trip here we noticed a C rating from the health inspector on the door. The crab dumplings really upset my stomach one night. So sad. We liked this place the first time we came here.,0
A lot of the food carts they bring around are cold and the food doesn't taste fresh. I wanted to like this place because it's was recommended but I don't think I'll be coming back,0
The chicken w/ steamed veggies was horrible.  The soup dumplings were just ok.,0
"What a SOB place  to find!! Finding our way through the tourists and locals in Chinatown to come to this place was a real pain in the butt! The wait was not long but the inside of the restaurant was a MAD HOUSE! 

People flying around everyone shouting this and that. I guess that's a Chinese restaurant for you. We got seated with a bunch of other people, communal style since we were only 2.

Crab and pork dumplings - Meh. Pretty disappointed. Monterey Park here in LA has better dumplings than that! I didn't like the juice just flowing outta the dumpling, it was hard to eat. And I could barely taste the crab.

Beef Chowmein - So so. Just your average pan-fried noodles w/ brown sauce and beef.

Everyone left and right to us were raving about the dumplings....eh, not the best but worth an experience I guess.",0
"Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, CA has the best dumplings. Joe's does not even compare. The soup in the dumplings is overly salted and the dumpling just too heavy and has a overwhelming taste of raw flour. Tried their noodle and rice dishes which were extrememly salty and have so much MSG in them my body started to react to it. 

Would rather go to Vanessa's Dumplings down the street than wait in line for Joe's.",0
"Eh, I mean I like soup dumplings and the place is close. I find the place just 'too cool for school.' The staff doesn't seem to care- even for an Asian place because their wall of fame seems to make them think they're fireproof. The pork and crab dumplings are good, but I've definitely had better-just not in Manhattan, but it's worth the trek out to Flushing if you really want XLB.",0
The food was good. The service was rushed. Exactly as expected for a Landmark establishment of this caliber.,0
"Joe's Shanghai is quite reputable. 

Food wise, the Juicy Buns are definitely above average: but you can find better in one spot in Flushing...although the wait might be even longer. 

Their steamed bread (plain buns?) are tiny but really fresh. Do not get the fried ones, as the oil used seemed a bit old...made the bread much darker than usual with a funky oily smell to it. Bottom line: these ultra fresh, delicate breads aren't made for frying. 

Scallion pancake at this place is definitely below average. Do not get it. 

A word about the crowd at this location: the waiters will pass everything over your food, your table, and you...even dirty plates from another party at your table. They are also in a rush to clear your table...when my wife finished her food, they cleared away her plate settings along with all the sauces, while I am still working on my food. A strange habit that bothers even their manager. 

The waiters can speak English well enough, but the busboys do not. But if you can speak Mandarin, that's a different story. 

Anther word of caution: NO NEED TO TIP! Unless you really want to. 

Alot of people miss the tiny postings (font size 12?) on the walls stating that 15% service charge is already included in the bill. We saw lots of people struggle to figure out what the tip should be, only to find out that service charge was already included in the bill. Since we went there few days after the Lunar New Year, we wanted to give a much bigger tip, something that borders 25-30%. But we got ticked off when the manager refused to remove the service charge from the total so we can leave our own tip...so it was their loss...sorry!",0
"My family and I haven't come here in years. We decided to go today on a whim. Once our food came, we realized why we have not been back for so long.   We remembered the last time we came we said the same thing...food was so bad and it continues to be today. Unfortunately this restaurant only survives by reputation. The food had no taste and the Xiao Long Bao was not up to the usual standards. They were big and mushy and broke apart immediately to the touch spreading the soup all over. The seasonal vegetables were suppose to be cooked with garlic and oil. Instead they came with no garlic and no taste at all. Super bland. The beef noodle soup was horrible. Noodles were not cooked. They were doughy and raw.  We would not recommend this restaurant unfortunately. It is iconic to NY but unfortunately they have let there standards slip from 10/10 to 2/10 Very sad. We always just accepted the poor service for the good food but now there's no reason to go at all. Bad service and bad food. Try Pinch in soho for the best Xiao Long Bao (chef/owner from Ding Tai Fong) plus amazing side dishes and the best beef noodle soup!",0
"I live in a nearby neighborhood so like I like to walk to Chinatown.  All,that is to say I am no stranger to Chinatown.  I have enjoyed Joe's Shanghai in the past so I was happy to go for an early dinner with the hubby.  Sadly, like many places that become popular JS  has taken a bad turn.  We ordered crab soup dumplings ( cause you always order soup dumplings here).  They were just okay.  We also,order cold noodles with sesame sauce, which was awful.  The noodles were over cooked and the sauce was too thick with unmixed globs of s",0
"Oh hell no.

Went here on multiple recommendations about the soup dumplings. Stopped by this place on a Saturday night (located on sketchy side street) and found a line of people waiting for the lottery. I thought 'It must be really good if there's a line'. My party waited almost 45 mins. to be called. I'm no stranger to Chinatown's crowded eateries and lumped seating arrangements where you're often seated next to strangers. We were hoping for a small table but found we were about to be lumped with two other parties at a large round table. I was not about to endure unwanted awkwardness so I opted for takeout. We ordered pork soup dumplings and headed back to my place to enjoy them...or so I thought. On the way over, I kept thinking 'What is that nasty vinegar-like smell that keeps following us?' I was hit full on with that odor when I opened the container of dumplings. I gave them a try thinking it had to be good since people raved about them. No - they were terrible! They fell apart easily and ended up in the trash. Gross. Sticking to Flushing restaurants that do it way better.",0
"Not too shabby for a touristy spot, but I was expecting more. The soup dumplings (xiao long bao) from Shanghai Dumpling King in SF are better. Joe's are bigger, the skin thicker, and the meat felt more processed. Their kung pao chicken, however, was decent. (I know what you're thinking.. minus credibility points for ordering this, but don't judge until you try it!)",0
Hmm...I'm not sure if I just had high hopes or if we came on an off night. I really was not wowed by their xlb or their other dishes.  Everything was ok but not impressive.,0
"Maybe they had an off day, but my soup dumplings were breaking, they were filed with oil not soup.  They don't have just crab, and I am not docking stars for that but I could have sworn I read they had just crab, but they have either pork or pork and crab but not just crab.  I think that's another reason I did not enjoy it because I don't love pork.  We also ordered scallion pancakes that never showed up... we weren't charged for it though but that's great service!  Yeah I won't come back and give it another chance.... Just not my thing.",0
"Overrated.  My friend lives 1 block away from here so we walked over and waited for about 10 minutes for a table for 8 people.  

It was a HOT day. The AC was not cool enough. A lot of Caucasian tourists. $6.65 for a steamer of 8 xiao lung bao.  The skin was thin but not as thin as Ding Tai Fung in Arcadia, California.  I love the broth but I realized it is so oily and the crab meat dumpling was oozing with yellow crab meat juice.  

I retasted this place after eating here 5 years ago, I have to say I won't be back.  The tables are tight. The service is fast.  I heard the other locations are a bit better.",0
"It was good. Don't get me wrong. The soup dumplings were good. but they did not amaze me like I thought they would. The size was a lot bigger than the ones i've tried before. And soup inside was very flavorful. The dough for the wrap was just ....lacking. It seemed to doughy for me. I prefer the thin wrappers likes DTF. The meat filling was decent. I prefer Mama Lu's/. (yes i'm comparing to spots in 626/CA area)
Is the wait worth it? Maybe. It is a tourist spot.  I say gotta try it once I  your life.",0
"Positive:
1. Food is excellent. I only tried crab/pork dumplings as most people reviewed about it on yelp. 
2. Pepper fried duck was good too. 
3. Service is quick. No bull shit. 

Negative:
1. They do not have any dumpling without pork. Even the crab dumpling comes with pork. So if you do not eat pork, forget the dumplings. 
2. Only cash accepted. 
3. Overcrowded(due to popularity) 
4. Tables are shared amongst strangers, so do not expect privacy",0
"I've been going to Chinatown for Shanghai buns for many years, so I've had my fair share. Finally visited Joe's since there was no wait. Not a big deal but if you didn't know, you have to share big round tables with others. The buns were a bit bigger than usual but there was really nothing special. Save yourself the wait and go to the many other Shanghai restaurants around. Nothing against it, but doesn't deserve the hype.",0
"Decided to pay this place a visit while in Chinatown. I tried the shrimp dumplings, Shanghai's fried rice and veggie dumplings. The portions were quite generous, we even took some food to go. A good option if you happen to be in the neighborhood.",0
Yes the soup dumplings are amazing but that is it! The attention seems to be on raising prices which makes it less attractive for a Chinatown location. Sorry last time as a local visiting this tourist trap!,0
"If this place only served Xia Long Bao it would deserve a 5 hands down! 

Let me help you out, if you're reading all the reviews everyone and I mean everyone is going to give this place 5 stars solely on the Xia Long Bao and they're not wrong. I have never seen so much soup stuffed into a dumpling, and its packed full of flavor. These are literally THE best dumpling ever!

Sadly everything else this place serves is mediocre at best. After trying several other dishes we decided to actually save our appetite for another restaurant. Don't get me wrong the rest of the food wasn't bad it just wasn't anything special. Com'on it's New York why eat something mediocre when you can walk down the street and eat something orgasmic.

In the end this place is a must just for the dumpling. If I was rich I would fly back just to eat them! (Too bad I'm poor)",0
"Great place to get soup dumplings but I've had better. There is always a long line no matter what time you go. The restaurant always seems to be a bit crowded and hectic, so if you want to go here for a first date I would reconsider it.",0
"Dumplings:

I suspect there might be a dumpling vampire somewhere because the last 2 times I came, my dumplings had been bled dry of the precious soup that makes them *soup* dumplings.  I lived in Shanghai for a summer and all the dumplings I had there were small and delicate, ""ping-pong ball-esque"" if you will, with just a bit of filling of filling and a TON of soup.  These, on the other hand, are larger, thicker skinned and big on meat - more ""golf ball-esque"".  Not bad, just not what I expected from THE soup dumpling place in NY.  They're also a little stingy with the vinegar.  I need a lot of vinegar and that little dish they brought out will not do...tisk tisk tisk.

Other stuff:

- Lion's Head (Stewed Pork Balls): YUM!  I guess I'm a sucker for meatballs.  These were fantastic.  Big, soft, and fluffy.  Definitely hit the spot.  Also made the other 7 people we shared the table with very jealous. (Definitely worth ordering for the jealousy factor alone -- ball envy.)
- Some fried noodle dish: Yum. (no caps) 
- Veggies of the day: YUM (no exclamation mark) sauteed with garlic and magic.

Administrative stuff:

It looks like a high-end version of the standard hole-in-the-wall (HITW) Chinese joint but with a lot more tourists and the prices match the look.  Service is the standard sub-par service we have come to expect and love from said HITW restaurants.

Worth a visit, not worth the wait on the regular.",0
"Honestly, the soup dumplings are good, but I know two other spots just as good for cheaper and better service. 

Highly rude and rush you out practically the moment you get your food. As much as I hate to admit,  but there is also an air of racism as everytime I go, I have noticed my party gets consistently better attention if there is an Asian person in my party (they do not even specifically have to be Chinese, or of Chinese descent). 

I will recommend only if you are into the idea of getting really quick food and don't mind the hustle. Otherwise, there are many better spots in Chinatown to spend your time and money.",0
"Okay, Joe's has been renowned for its dumplings for years and I think Joe's been living off this for years .  Sorry, but I think even the dumplings are overrated.  Sure, it takes skills to make dumpling skin that is both thin and yet elastic enough to contain that much broth in addition to the filling.  But I'd take a little less broth if I could have broth that tasted better.   

And with all the great Chinese food you can find in Chinatown/Flushing, I don't think it's worth the trek down here just for the dumplings.",0
"I remember when this place first open and it was the BOMB. Unfortunately, very unfortunately the quality of this place went downhill fast. They have so much business that they don't really care about how the food is made anymore. The soup dumpling's skin was thick and squirts oily soup. If you let the soup sit on your plate for a while, it starts to coagulate. Their food, however, is still one of the best Shanghainese restaurants in NYC.

THEIR SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS!!!!!!!!!!! I know us Chinese people's customer service is not that great compared to American restaurants however I have never experienced such RUDE, RUDE, RUDE servers. I asked for a table for 4 but my friend was late so I wanted to put us down on the list first (long line). It's okay to just tell us nicely that we have to wait until my friend comes BUT THAT LADY JUST YELLED AT ME. HOLY COW. Literally, just screamed at me with her high pitch voice and her gross attitude. The waiters were all snickering when we ask for normal things people ask for in restaurants. I really didn't understand what was so funny and what's with that attitude. 

I wonder why they put that 15% service charge on the bill though. Is it because their service is so shitty that people refuse to pay tip so they have to enforce it?",0
"THEY ARE THIEVES. That said, the food is terrific. Never had a problem there. But the service downright sucks. They are rude, and inattentive. Even when the restaurant is slow. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU ARE PAYING WITH LARGE GROUPS. Tonight I went with a group of six and we all put $20 in, which was well over the amount of the bill but we needed change back. Instead, our waiter insisted we only gave him $100 instead of $120. Then the owner came out and accused us of lying... a group of six people lying over $20.

So yea. Just...be wary and confirm how much cash you give them since they don't take credit cards. Otherwise they'll conveniently miscalculate and it will never be in your favor.",0
"i have no idea what everyone is raving about. I went here with my sister after reading these great reviews and was SO SO disappointed. The famous ""crab"" /pork ""dumplings"", firstly had no sign of any crab and secondly squirted out oily soup...or should i say dishwater. 

we also got the ""flat shanghai noodle"".. which was also gross and not flat but cylinder shaped.  i had to drench it in soy sauce to make it taste okay. 


We are  however comparing to Shanghai/CHinese cuisine in australia which is way less oily, far more flavorsome and has less MSG. 

p.s we both have stomach aches",0
"Service was good and it seemed really popular. The food was just ok, not the worth the price at all.",0
"I give this one star because you can't go any lower....let's get right to it....we came from another place that we had apps in....shanghai 21...very good...we came here for the duck!  We decided to order more soup dumplings....scallion pancake ..vole noodles sesame sauce....beef noodle soup.

Ok...the soup dumpling was dry....like the outside was dry...not moist or soupy...hard and doughy....the noodles in peanut sauce was hard noodles in melted peanut butter....the scallion pancake was a thick fritatta like greasy pancake....the beef noodle soup had this loooooong dark black hair intertwined in the noodles!

Ok the duck....im so excited about it....waited half hour for it but that's what you do for duck.  It comes out...they already cut it up!!!!  We wanted tableside cut up presentation....bummer....skin is not crispy....you bite into it and your mouth fills up with grease.  I'm done with this place!  Now I know why its cash only...you can't fight your credit card company about it then.  Save your hard earned cash!",0
If you are looking for a just OK Chinese food then this is an acceptable choice.  But apparently their flavor is not authentic enough even for my two US born and bred teenagers who are so used to high standard of Southern California Chinese restaurants. Bottom line - this is a bit too touristy for our taste.,0
"Idk the line is long, you're sharing a table with random ppl, smells sort of like steamed banana rolls and it's cash only. 

But they give you sooo much food for your money. We ordered both the pork and crab soup dumplings, cold noodles and scallion pancakes. It was too much for 2 ppl. The dumplings here are hugeeee. It taste decent but the wrapping is really thick. I liked the pork one more than the crab one. You definitely taste the crab in the crab dumpling but it's very overpowering. They have hot oil and vinegar with ginger on the table. Scallion pancake was nice and buttery. Definiely would pass on the cold noodles. It's just sesame sauce, no other seasonings on overcooked noodles. Happy to have tried it but there are better soup dumplings elsewhere for cheap.",0
"It's very greasy ""Chinese food"" that gives Chinese food a bad name. I've tried soup dumplings and scallion pancake at other places and the quality of the ingredients and technique of the cooking gives a better less-greasy product than Joe's. 

Other things I ordered were Shanghai style flat noodles and stewed pork with tofu skins. 

The noodles were oily and so was the food generally. The cost for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees,  1 coke, 2 bowls of rice came out to about $50. 

The price isn't high but not low either and sort of typical for a meal at many places (so no cost savings here). 

The place like the name is kinda greasy looking too.",0
"This is a typical overrated restaurant. The only dish that was worth eating was the soup dumplings. Four other dishes that we tried were lame and salty. Also they obviously were evading tax for the waiter accepted the next table White customers' credit card payment, but demanded cash only from us. I hope IRS would pay attention to this restaurant for the discrepancy between the amount of business they are getting and the earnings they file. I would suspect they only report half of their earnings to the IRS. Remember the more tax they evade, the more tax everyone else has to pay and it is illegal. Next time, refuse to pay tips unless they take your CC.",0
"The Kung Pao chicken had no heat at all, but it had good flavor.  The spring rolls were crispy, and decent flavor but they did not have duck sauce.  The pork dumplings are excellent, and the potions are plentiful.  That said, the wait is very long and they seat you out of order.  several numbers after mine were called out before I was seated.  The family style seating leaves them few options for seating, and they are often seating 2 or 3 separate groups at the same table.  $14 for kung pao, I expected a bit more.",0
"Oily oily, cash only, and no XLB that's seafood based. It's the last one that really got me. Otherwise most people probably think this place is decent.",0
"the famous XLB dumplings were quite good though the crab version was hotter than the pork one and the broth seemed to be richer. We also tried clams in black bean sauce, a family favorite that we haven't had in a few years. Plenty of clams (and generous salting) we (two) had no trouble finishing 2 orders of The  xlb and the clams with the rice. 

We arrived at about 5:00pm Saturday and had no wait. Of course the scene was very different when we left .  Note: this is the sort where everyone uses chopsticks so if you have self-conscious guests who don't like being the only ones in a packed, non private table using a fork find an uptown place!",0
"What happened to Joe shanghai? This used to be my go-to place for soup dumplings in Chinatown but it recently moved to a new location nearby. The decor is much nicer and the space is bigger but everything else went downhill. 

Our soup dumplings came out first. We had a order of the pork soup dumplings and a order of the crab and pork soup dumplings. They were filled with plenty of soup inside and the flavor was good. However, the skin of the dumpling was a bit too thick and overpowered the filling. 

Throughout my whole dining experience here, the service was odd and unorganized. Before we even had a chance to look through the menu, a server was standing behind us waiting to take our order. After we ordered our food, we asked for a cup of tea but yet they came back with a plate of cold chicken instead that we didn't order. When we were almost done with our meal, we inquired about one of the missing items we ordered earlier and he told us he didn't put the order through. Why did he say okay when we placed the order then? They also put a vegetarian noodle dish on our table but another waiter rushed over to take it back since it didn't belong to us. We ordered the beef pan fried noodles. When it finally arrived, the noodles were nice and crispy and there was a good variety of ingredients inside. However, we thought the dish was way too salty!",0
"Great ambiance, very clean and good service. The food portions are large and satisfying. Good food. There is better in the area but the food and the price and suitable and good.",0
"I use to crave the dumplings from this place, until I went with my sister.  I was shocked when she poured out the soup from her dumpling onto her plate and only ate the dumpling.  She was practically missing out on the essence of this ""delicacy"".  My sister ended up doing this for all the dumplings she ate and after some time, her plate looked like a disgusting, jello-y, vat of fat and grease.  It was the first time I saw what the soup actually looked like and it grossed me out!  Now I understood why my stomach would always hurt after eating these dumplings, it was because I was drinking lard!

But if you decide that you want to fill your stomach with fat and grease, the pork dumplings are better than the crab, and the scallion cake compliments the dumplings as you get the same grease but deep-fried.

There are two ways to eat these dumplings.  First, you take a dumpling from the basket and place it on your spoon, and this in itself is an art as you don't want to tear your dumpling during the transfer or you'll lose all the soup.  Once you've successfully placed the dumpling on your spoon, you can go one of two ways.  I usually bite the top of the dumpling and then slurp the soup.  Others poke a hole at the bottom of their dumpling with a chopstick, let the soup pour out into the spoon, and slurp the soup before eating the dumpling.  In either case there's a good chance that you'll burn your mouth so be careful!",0
"This place is definitely a tourist destination - and if you're a local like myself you know there are far more better dim sum / Shanghai places.

With that said, the highlights for me were the soup dumplings. Which again, were good, but I've had others that were great.

I LOVED their chicken fried rice. They gave so much, definitely enough to share for 2-4 people and be satisfied. I don't know if it's the seasoning, or what to put my finger on - but it's delicious and probably the best fried rice I've ever had.

Didn't really care for the pan fried noodles. I got the beef option - and the beef and broccoli in the brown sauce was delicious - but the pan fried noodles were thick and became soggy because of the sauce. And instead of absorbing it and being packed with flavor - they become chewy and less desirable. 

PS. this place is cash only! heads up.",0
Only okay. I feel like it is overrated and a bit of a tourist trap. I think there are definitely better Shanghainese restaurants around.,0
"I've been coming here for over 10 yrs now. I'm not sure what happened but the quality has definitely changed and its disappointing. The ratio of wrapper to soup and meat is pretty significant. The wrapper is much larger and you no longer are able to enjoy the dumpling in one bite. I'm not sure if the owners changed but it's sad... I always look forward to visiting Joe's when I'm in NYC. Maybe, it was an off day fo",0
"I had the Xiao Long Bao, their signature meat bun. It was mediocre, nothing I could NOT get here in Virginia.

I wish I had the CHANCE to eat here. It was so packed..",0
Used to be one of my favorite dumpling spot in Chinatown . Now I would say that there are 3 other places in Chinatown that have better prices and tastier dumplings and tip is your option (Joe adds the tip to your bill).  Service is bad and the waitstaff can be rude at times.  Yelpers who give them rave reviews need to venture into Chinatown and try some of the other dumpling places.  Joe Shanghai went from a great place to an average place.  Next time you want soup dumplings explore other options in Chinatown.  Walk down Bayard or Mott street even Elizabeth street you have so many options. Don't limit yourself.,0
"Dumplings are okay. Cool location. A lot going on inside, it can be a little intimidating if you're not a regular I guess. Not my kind of spot. I sat at a random table with an older man and woman who were also there alone. A little weird, waiters all over trying to tend to everyone. The place was packed. I went for a quick bite at lunch hour. Might want to avoid the lunch hour here lol. (12-2) Dumpling+Noodle is my favorite spot in Bronxville.",0
"I was so excited to eat at Joe's Shanghai tonight after work!!! The atmosphere was lively, cheery and bustling at 6pm and I was with good company :). Despite the crowd, we were seated promptly and with a smile. It was looking to be a promising first experience.

Now, I know my xiao long baos. My parents are from Shanghai and I had them every day while I was there in June. And let me tell you, the XLBs at JS did not disappoint...

...that is, until we found a MAGGOT latched onto a dumpling. I thought it was a loose piece of cabbage at first, but upon closer inspection, I saw its juicy segmented body and little leg bumps...mmm, insect appendages...

Needless to say, we all lost our appetites. When we pointed out the maggot to the waiter, he dismissed it as a ""vegetable bug"" -- what the heck is that? -- and said he'd put in another order for us. But we didn't want more -- who knows how many maggots there are hidden in those dumplings??!

We were refunded that one order of XLBs and decided to take our noodle dishes to go, barely touched. We left empty-stomached, spooked, and very disappointed. No way I'm coming back.",0
"Very juicy xlb. I liked them a lot;  it was good . The restaurant filled up quick, we arrived before they open and had to line up outside the store . I didn't try anything else just one order of pork and one of crab to go since it was almost time for us to check out of the hotel.  After we walked back to the hotel, the xlb were still steamy hot.  I will come back for more next time I visit NYC.",0
"Community tables, huge portions, food is ok. Not the best Chinese food out there if you ask me but decent food. Dumplings are good, fried rice is ok, duck very very dry. The service is terrible. I read the reviews before and most people said the service is great. Maybe I really didn't get lucky this time, but our waiter was a ******* ! Didn't give us any water, wouldn't respond when I'd talk to him and when I asked if I could get watermelon (I saw many plates with some so I made me want some too!) he straightly said: no. A dry ass no. And left without any explanation. The guy sitting next to me was just as shocked as I was and said he probably didn't hear me. So he asked him for me! The guy purely and simply looked at him and ignored him. WTH?
Also didn't care to ask if we wanted a doggy bag for our leftovers. They got thrown away immediately. Let's say communication isn't the speciality of the house. And I won't go back.",0
"The food was ok. Standard Shanghai dishes and the taste was alright. Around half of the dumplings were stuck to the steaming basket and had no soup which was disappointing. 

The worst part of this restaurant was the service. We were a party of 2 placed on a table with two other parties. This was fine since the restaurant was mostly full. We asked the female server with glasses by the door if we could get some help to remove some empty plates from the table as the table became full. She answered in a very rude tone and said ""No I can't"". No wonder this place charges a mandatory 15% service fee.",0
"Don't expect tablecloths or fine china - or even the waiters to pay attention to you without excessive flagging.

Joe's Shanghai is a pretty typical, run of the mill Chinatown restaurant - expect it to be busy, cheap, and loud, and don't expect to always get your own table. There's always a crowd waiting outside, and they seat as efficiently as possible - that includes filling up the bigger tables as fully as possible. 

The menu options have all the family favourites, but people really seem to come to Joe's Shanghai for the soup dumplings. 

The soup dumplings were pretty good - they definitely weren't the best I've ever had, and I honestly don't think they were the best in Chinatown either. None of them had popped or leaked, but the skin is pretty thick, and instead of being plump, some of them kind of shrivel up. The other food on the menu is pretty run of the mill.",0
Soup dumplings are really big and oily. 456 Shanghai in Chinatown is better.,0
"The hot and sour soup was excellent. The rest - soup dumplings, pickled cabbage, cold sesame noodles - was WAY too oily. Too oily even for our 6 foot teenager who is a human food vacuum. I love Chinese but would have to say give this one a pass.",0
"Very noisy & crowded.  Menu is not clear, start doesn't always understand English.

I thought the food was ok.  I could get better in my in neighborhood.  I wouldn't go out of my way for this place.",0
We got pork and crab xlb. They were really big and there was tons of soup inside but I feel like it is not as flavorful. It definitely needs soy sauce and vinegar to make it taste better. The onion pancakes was way too starchy n it didn't have enough onion. I would not order that again.,0
"Be prepared to share your table with at least 2 other parties and be massively confused about whose xiao long bao is whose. 

I'm actually ok with the arrangement and the somewhat hurried pace, but I think that the food is overall pretty average.

Soup dumplings have good integrity, thin skin the way I like it, but the soup was too oily/salty for me. Reasonable price though ($6.75 for 8)

Also ordered the salt and pepper pork chops, which came out a bit soggy, didn't have enough spice, and sadly reminded me more of chicken nuggets :(

The shanghai noodles tasted pretty good, but more saucy/oily than I'd like.

Cash only!",0
The food is medicore but the service is extremely TERRIBLE.   They don't treat customers with any respect but yet they want to receive 20% TIPS.,0
"Totally disappointed after flying 5,000 miles to try out this place.

First, three groups of customer -- 11 people -- needed to share a table.   We ordered the cold dishes:   Dry Bean Curd with Mixed Vegetables and Wine Chicken.  And then Peking Style Minced Pork Noodle and two orders of Xiaolongbao.

The dried bean curd is lousy in quality -- but I don't blame the chef since there ain't any good dried bean curd found anywhere in North America.  But the wine chicken is really so so -- most likely due to the kind of Shaoxing wine the chef uses.

The Xiaolongbao is the most disappointing -- we couldn't even finish it.  The top part of the dumpling is tough (most likely as a result of refrigeration) while the broth tastes like fatty pork mixed with MSG.

Did our fellow yelpers, who are impressed by their dumplings, ever try the Xiaolongbao from Ding Tai Fung?

But the food is incredibly cheap -- many items came under $5 -- so you get what you pay for.",0
"For me customer service is really important in a restaurant. Waiters/Waitresses can easily ruin your appetite. To me, the food was a bit better than other shanghai restaurants you go to in chinatown. The waiter/waitresses do not respect customers.",0
Not authentic at all...and the do not have dim sum as it said in yelp.. Too salty and very American Chinese... First time yelp lets me down:(,0
"I do NOT know what the hype is with this place. 
The Shanghai Dumplings were OK; definitely NOT the best. 
The 'skin' on the dumpling was too dry and thick. It was Not silky nor was it yummy. 
The filling in the dumpling (we got the Crab and Pork) was OK. 
The ONLY thing i liked was the soup IN the dumpling. that was flavorful and thicker than usual. 

The other dishes were really quite bland/ boring. 

Summary:
- Shanghai Fried Rice- Pretty yummy. 
- Yang Chow Fried Rice- that was OK. 
- 5 Spice Fried Chicken. SO BLAND. I don't know why they wouldn't just marinate the chicken and coat it with the 5 spice instead of bringing out the salt in a separate dish. 

We also ordered 2 different dishes which LOOKED and TASTED exactly the same except they were served on 2 separate plates and with 1 different ingredient. 
HELLO? 

I felt completely ripped off.
I also just found out that the Service charge/ TIP has already been added to the check- i paid an EXTRA 15% for so-so food and bad service? FAIL

No more Joe's Shanghai for me- I can get MUCH better dumplings from random dimsum places in SF or LA and definitely Way better ones in Asia. 

Fail",0
"The hype this restaurant joys and the long wait outside are not reflective of the overall quality of the food. The dumplings were ""good"", not great. The duck was tasteless . Sesame noodles definitely had peanut butter added which is a no-no. Service was quite good. Best bet in Chinatown is to poke around and see where the locals are eating and avoid the touristy places such as this. We live in San Francisco and we follow our own advice!",0
"Joe's has long been on my list to try, and unfortunately was a total miss for me. The food was decent, but it wasn't amazing. We did order take out online and eat once we got to Brooklyn. Which I do reccomend if you want food but don't want to wait in line, it was ready fast!
We enjoyed the plum chicken & shrimp (not v much shrimp) & the soup dumplings were pretty good too. The chicken fried rice was very dry which was strange because it was very dark like it had lots of sauce on it. The general tso was fried nice just wasn't quite as spicy as I expect it to be!
The food wasn't terrible by any means, I just think I'd rather try somewhere else next time",0
"Came here during COVID so didn't have to wait in line for hours like it used to be. The soup dumplings are amazing as always, but the regular dishes are just so-so. TBH the dishes are on the pricey side given the quality and quantity.",0
"Came here on a Thursday evening around 8:15 pm, waited for a good 45 minutes for a party of 4. Came in and saw that we were sharing a table with 3 other people, no worries, that's fine. At this point, we were already starving. Decided to order the Shanghai flat noodles, which was good BUT I must add...this dish was quite oily. Literally, each strand slithers into your mouth without any suction - kid you not. Next, we ordered the crab and pork dumplings...alright, I've been to a few XLB restaurants back in California so I know what good XLB taste like. As they set the order of the dumplings, I noticed half of them already had their juices popped!!!! No need to use the silver tong, use your chopsticks so you don't burst the soup, but no need for that since it was already spilled all over the lettuce -___- This place is hyped up, not a fan at all and will not be coming back. Let me go back home and fill this satisfying hunger. Bleh",0
"Was here last year... Quality went down for sure.  Also it was noticeable more expensive this time.  And they added an automatic tip on a party of two! 

Last time I'm coming here",0
"Oh, wow.  This place is so overrated.  Overrated in the same way Notre Dame football is overrated.  The dining room is crowded...which, for a Chinese restaurant, is actually a good thing.  Don't eat in a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have crowds.  Trust me.  But I digress.  The crowd makes for unfriendly service and you'll likely be rubbing elbows with strangers.  I don't mind this if the food is good.  But it's not worth it for average food.    

Their steamed pork dumplings (soupy dumpling house specialty) were pretty good.  Careful when taking a bite, as the juice squirts out all over the place.  Decent flat rice noodle dish.  Actually, all the dishes we had were decent to good.  

This place is a typical Chinese food dive, with dive-like service, cleanliness, and seating.  But not-so-dive-like prices.  Throw in the crowds and the poor service and you have a below average experience.  If you've convinced yourself that you want a ""cultural"" experience of really crowded dining rooms with people speaking loudly (code for semi-yelling) to go along with brusque service because it makes you think ""China""...then you might check out this place.",0
"Jesus christ , I have no idea how this place got so famous. The food here is quite bad, and they sure do use a lot of rubber bands in their food. Yes I know they're not rubber bands but they sure do look, feel, and taste like it. There are other ways to make that stuff without it being so... so rubber bandy. I would give this place one star as they are rather pricey as well, BUT they do have good soup dumplings and I am aware that's the main attraction. But that's my tip, only get the soup dumplings, just about everything else sucks.",0
"Everyone always raves about this place, so I just had to try it out. It was pretty empty when I went there, perhaps it was too early to really be dinner time. I tried the regular soup dumplings and I wasn't that impressed. Perhaps I eat frozen ones too much? I didn't really like it all that much and I feel like this place is pretty much over-hyped.",0
It's been several years since I've been here but the experience has tanked. Ordered two xiao long baos and it took 40 min to come out. And only 1 order came out and they charged us for two. The dumpling is also not as good anymore.,0
"Omg I was so excited to try Joe's Shanghai especially the crazy amount of reviews at this particular location, but it is really not worth the hype.


Being from the west coast here in Los Angeles, I have my regular dumpling house I go to called Mama Lu's. I of course had expectations Joes will surpass the Lu's, but it didn't. Their famous xiao long bao aka pork soup dumpling lacked flavor and the texture of the wrap is not authentic at all if you know what a true xiao long bao is suppose to taste like. Only thing that attracts customers is the huge size of these dumplings, but I'm more of a quality over quantity type of gal.


We also ordered szechuan beef with bean curd and shanghai noodle soup. Those weren't good either. So I honestly have nothing else to say about them.



Overall this is more of a tourist spot. The service is just like any typical fast pace Asian restaurant (meaning no service pretty much). Portions are huge though.",0
"I don't get all the hype.  It's okay food.  I do not like that they add the 15% tip to the bill.My friend and I went on a Sunday at noon and there was no line.

The soup dumplings tasted like other places to me.  The Szechuan beef tendon noodle soup was good.  I liked how soft the noodles were.  The Singapore chow mai fun was yummy and had lots of fun.  I liked how fluffy the eggs were.  

I think sharing the table with an annoying couple took away from my experience.  The couple was annoying and the guy had to ask his wife every time he if he was allowed to eat something.  They wouldn't stop asking us what we ordered and how do we eat our soup dumplings.",0
Food is good as expected. But price is high. They also need to renovate. The furniture is old. But I think they believe in not changing anything because of the superstition that it will blow away all their good luck and blessings. They also need to get their city rating up from B. It's kinda gross to think that they're not clean back there handling food.,0
"The worst service ever. The hostess skipped our group having us wait for over an hour. After confronting and asking, she continued to ignore our party until I spoke to the manager. We also sat at the table with random strangers already eating. The odor in the Restaurant smells atrocious. I would never recommend or return.",0
"The food definitely wasnt bad but all the buzz about it is uncalled for. The xiao long bao was alright, and the same goes for the beef tendon and their house chilli. I'd head to shanghai asian manor over it any time.",0
"So disappointing. We ordered crabmeat xiaolongbao, yuntun soup and fired rice cakes. All taste weird and bad. I would say not even as good as any other random restaurant in Chinatown. Don't know why it is so over-rated. Will never go there again.",0
"I personally think this place is just overrated.  There are plenty of good Shanghai food in Chinatown besides Joe's Shanghai. One time I order my Xiao Long Bao and inside the dumpling it has a nose hair.  I almost ate it and good thing my friend caught it before I popped it in my month.  Yuck, never again I would go to this place.  Very disturbing!",0
"Dude take card 
The food was O.K. The dumplings and the chicken are the only good things there. Forget about the seafood it was slimy and gross like it was cooked and then reheated.",0
"I am a dumpling monster and wanted to try the East Coast rival to Din Tai Fung. Having tried DTF only two weeks prior in California, I felt I was at a vantage point to compare the two locations. Although I feel Din Tai Fung definitely wins the battle, Joe's Shanghai still satisfied my XLB cravings and were very tasty.

// WAIT // 20 minutes for a party of 5 at 4 PM on a Saturday

// SERVICE // You feel incredibly rushed to eat and you are accosted several times to ask if you are done with your order and to pay. Once you pay, you are given the stink eye to hurry out so they can seat more people in their massive line. In addition, tables are communal to accomodate as many people as possible.

// FOOD //
     + Crab soup filled dumplings: Dumplings are larger than DTF, but not nearly as pretty because the skins are very thick and the dumplings are wrapped messily. Presentation aside, they are still very tasty
     + Pork xiao long bao: Larger and juicier than DTF, but the juices that are flowing definitely are oilier and taste fattier.",0
"This place is way too crowded and overrated.
If you see too many non chinese people at chinese restaurants you'll know it's overrated and all whitewashed.
the xiaolong bao wasn't that good, too much juice. When they brought the steamer out the buns look like they been mutilated. They need to have better presentation of their items. They should look the same everytime each time they bring it out. Being busy is no excuse to skimp on the presentation.
Do not get the spring rolls, do not get their pai gu noodles, the noodles are just regular noodles and the pork ribs are like fried. i was expecting them to be in soup form. you wanted me to mix a fried pork chopish item in a stewed noodle???!?!

I rather go the cheap dumpling places like Prosperity and others as they tasted way better and CHEAPER",0
"For those that live in chinatown or the area and have eaten at different places around CT, they can attest to the fact that this place is nothing special at all. The high rating and fame comes from hype, nothing more. Their food is mediocre / OK; nothing spectacular that warrants the 4 and 5 star ratings.

People who fall for the supposed rating, be prepared to be some what disappointed. Their Xiao Long Bao's are supposedly their specialty, compare it to any other shanghai restaurant, there isn't much if at all any discern-able difference. Their other foods can be rated as a dime a dozen, nothing super tasty of fantastic.

Me and my friends always laugh at the ridiculous amount of people piled up waiting to get in, especially since there's better food and plenty of other restaurants in the vicinity. But to each their own.",0
Food was pretty decent. Not any better than my local Chinese food places. I'm shocked it has so many high reviews and maybe a lot of the yelpers are from parts of the country/world where food Chinese food doesn't exist. It's good but not great. The wait staff is rude and wouldn't refill our waters after our first glass. They seemed like they were rushing us out. Which isn't a great feeling when you're trying to eat and enjoy conversation. Go when it's dead and over it'll be a better experience.,0
"This place is always crowded. Loaded with hipsters and some Chinese. If you're looking for XLB(Xiao long bao) in Manhattan this will most likely be your best option.

Is it the best XLB? No. It's not Din Tai Fung (when are you opening one in NY?) but it ain't bad. They have American Chinese food like General Tso chicken- I had it the first time here with friends while sharing a table with a lazy Susan with a bunch of teenage upper east side kids.. On a food culture trip... It ain't bad.

The service is horrible. Feed you. Check and pay! That's basically it. Beware of sour puss face waiters, they love their job so much that when they forgot your meal and you ask them about it- that 10 mins takes over an hour!",0
Food was ok. I have had way better Chinese food. Maybe we just did not order the right food but it was not that good. I had the salt and pepper squid (tasteless) and orange chicken ( this was good and very tender). We also got the crab and pork soup dumpling and it was not that great. . The service was ok. We were not offered water when we sat down and had to ask twice and finally got it half way through. The restaurant was less than half full but keep in mind that this is a small place.,0
"Terrible food, terrible service, doesn't live up to he's name. There is no reason no come here with so many good restaurants around",0
"I was looking for real chinese food so I did my research on yelp and found Joe's Shanghai. At first I was thinking, what kind of a name is Joe's Shanghai, is it a american chinese food that I got myself into too. The place was in back alley of ChinaTown so it took me some time to found it. The place itself was extremely pack and when I walk in, I saw all of their pic;s on all of the food magazine so I was happy that I want here. I order the crab and pork dumbling, soft shell crab and the minced pork noodle and 2 sing tao beer to drink. The dumbling was very good, it was so juicy that It was spilling all over the place. I have to admit, they make it better then the best place in California but it is only the 2nd best place. The first is has to be China.
The minced pork noodle was too sweet for my taste and the soft shell crab was a bit greasy for me. Next time I go here again, I am just going order more dumbling and more beer's to drink LOL",0
"Typically love every dish from here but ordered the beef w scallions for dinner. I would think the dish would be as mentioned, beef with scallions. Instead it was filled with this tasteless vegetable that legit was 75% of the dish, which I assume they use as a filler to use less beef. Insane that I paid 23 bucks for this. Gross.",0
This restaurant is only about the money and not about the customer.  They sat many tables in front of us and could careless about the table order.  The experience was ruined due to the excessive unnecessary wait!,0
"Health grade pending for the longest time, now a hidden ""C"" inside the front door. A C rating equates to some nasty stuff..sad because the food is fantastic. Sorry, can't go back until that grade improves.",0
"Oh Joe, what has happened to you? I think the Joe of my youth may have passed to the other side without sharing his secrets. This was my favorite Chinese place for decades, but since COVID the food is no longer okay. So upset.",0
"Three stars only due to their POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE (if you could even call it that)... They have so many staff working (if you consider standing around chatting to each other working), where you try to wave one over, they look at you, and seriously look away. WTH????  If it weren't for the yummy xiao lung bao's, i would really pass on this place. It's small, I feel like someone is ALWAYS walking into my chair, it's loud, and very uncomfortable when you're trying to indulge in ur xiao lung bao, but then there's this total stranger that's sitting at the same table....",0
"This place is always packed, but our wait was pretty short on memorial day weekend. 

It was my 2nd time trying this place. I liked the amount of soup inside the dumplings but they were too bland (at least for this time). The ginger sauce helped only a bit. Hopefully it'll be better next time~

((I personally prefer Philly's soup dumplings @ Dim Sum Garden))",0
"Love the food but hate the staff. My favorites are the soup dumplings. The staff however can be really mean. They will literally yell at you, roll there eyes and walk away shaking their heads if you ask them for anything.",0
Totally disappointed on our last visit -- now I think just a tourist trap.  Last time I was there a year ago sooooo much better quality.,0
"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon for some Xiao Long Bao (one of shanghai's most famous dish). Joe's Shanghai is one of NYC's first restaurant known for the dish. Over the years I feel that their quality of their most famous dish has decrease. There are other places in Chinatown that have this dish and taste the same if not better.

The waiters and waitresses are not polite, and many times you have to share tables with other parties. It is literally as if you are eating in China (the lower class restaurants). 

It is still a good place to go if you want a quick fix, doesn't mind the bad service and on a low budget. Also want a true feel of what most places in China feels like, then take a chance, you have nothing to lose.

I had a great time regardless because I was with good company. Go with good friends, ones that you don't need to impress.

Also, there are 3 locations: queens, midtown, and chinatown. The place is chinatown is about $2 cheaper per dish than the one in midtown. Queens is too far to compare for its distance.",0
This restaurant is disgusting. The the silverware they gave us was so dirty it stuck to the plate. When we asked the waiter about it he shrugged. The food has the same names as the food at Joe's Shanghai but not any flavor. We also observed the waiter telling a German tourist that he owed $6 for a tip and pressure him to pay it.  I think that's called being mugged by your waiter.,0
"The soup dumplings here are really good, along with the scallion pancakes.  When we arrived there it was cold out, and there was space to wait inside BUT! the girl who gave us a number told us we had to wait outside ... makes no sense to me but okay...anyways, to not get confused the soup/Shanghai dumplings are listed as ""steamed buns"" under the appetizer section. We ordered the crab & pork ones and the pork - the regular pork ones taste better than the one with crab meat.  The scallion pancakes were crispy and good, a little oily.  The two other dishes (Shanghai noodle and Eggplant with garlic sauce) we ordered were way too oily, which led me to believe that every other dish were would be pretty oily.  Overall, I would only come back here to eat the soup dumplings but probably nothing else.  We ended up bagging the two dishes up and giving them to a homeless man on the street.",0
"This place is spacious and the service is alright, however being known for their soup dumplings, I was not impressed. 
Served in a wooden dish in 8, around half of their dumplings were either dried up, or had all the soup already drained due to poor quality. 
Could use improvement.",0
"one word.  OILY!  everything OILY!! the din tai fung in LA is wayyyyy better.  the leaking soup in each dumpling was cool but the taste was OILY!  wasnt' satisfied at all so we went to the halal cart within the next hr and pigged out on a gyro & rice dish. and then, THAT hit the spot. we had to wait an hour for a table,which we shared with two other couples. suuuuper crowded and for what? some oil... i had to drink hot tea to oil it down.",0
"Go for the soup dumplings, not the Peking duck! The duck they serve is literally $30 and you get scraps!",0
"I came to this place with very high expectations since there was so much buzz around it. Sadly, was greeted with a giant C health rating at the door which I felt like they tried to hid in the corner. This kinda threw me off but I was already there so I decided why not. The food was decent but I would only recommend getting the soup dumplings since they is what they are known for. The egg plant in garlic was just the same as I could get any where else - nothing special. If you love soup dumplings then defiantly check this place out besides that thought, go somewhere with a better health rating.",0
"I've been hearing about differences in west coast versus east coast Xio Long Bao and wanted to see for myself. I've been several times to that famous west coast location in LA and was excited to try Joe's Shanghai. We caught the metro on a rainy Sunday morning to Chinatown, it was a short walk from the Canal street station and passed several dumpling shops on the way. Fortunately for us, we arrive at around 11: 15 am and we were able to get seats for 3 right away, no wait! 

Food: Pretty big menu but we were here for the soup dumplings. We ordered the Crab Meat with Pork Soup Dumplings, Pork Meat Soup Dumpling, Pork Boiled Dumplings (for contrast), and Egg Drop Soup. First off, the soup dumplings are huge compared to their west coast cousins at that famous place (rhymes with Tin Dai Mung). Filled to with an amazing amount of rich, creamy, fatty broth that overflows the soup spoon, it was definitely not a one bite and done dumpling. Drain out the soup first and enjoy, top with some of soy and vinegar and it was delicious. We favored the crab dumpling slightly ahead of it's porky brother. The boiled dumplings were okay, definitely bringing up the rear of the three we ordered. Compared to people around us, we really didn't bring our dumpling A game. We were not able to finish the 24 dumplings between the three of us which was a bit surprising. The diners sitting around us were still packing it away as we sadly (but happily full) admitted defeat.

Service: Loud, hurried, chaotic, everything that a good Chinese restaurant should have! Since it's a shared table, they place the food order on the table sized lazy susan and gesture to the party that ""owns"" that dish. Each party then removed the dish off the center and placed it by their plates. It can get a little crowded if you don't keep up with the pace of the food. Food itself came out very quickly once ordered.

Atmosphere: Bustling, loud, lots of activity, large round tables that you share with total strangers, it was a great experience. Never having been here we did not know what to expect since we were seated right away. When we left Joe's after about 45 minutes there must have been 40+ people waiting outside the door. It was a cool experience but if that crowd had been there when we arrived we may have very well chosen one of the other dumpling spots in the area. 

Value: Soup dumplings were all under $10 with entree meals priced between $10 and $20 provides pretty good value. 

Overall: I wouldn't mind returning in the future to try some of Joe's other offerings. Some of the noodles dishes seemed quite popular as well, coming with a larger group probably is better as people can try a wider variety. I was a little torn as the boiled dumplings were okay, the soup dumplings were good and the price to size ratios were off the charts. They compared well to their west coast cousins especially in the value department but I've had better xio long bao in NY but at a much higher price point. I'd give them a 3.5 stars.",0
"I still don't understand why people come here from all over the world, including Asian countries. I thought they would have better xiao long bao over there? Don't get me wrong, the food here is not bad but not the best and not worth the wait.",0
"Not recommended. 
Went there on Chinese New Year Eve. The service was really bad. no reservation accepted, were asked to wait outside, and no seating before everybody arrives, even we told them that we could order right after seated. 
NO sense of customer service and lack flexibity at all. 
I will never come back again, and next time will try Shanghai Cafe instead, heard they have even better Xiao Long Bao!!!",0
"This was one of the first restaurants we ate at when we first moved to Manhattan because I heard good things about it. Turns out, the food really is just average, and the services is sub-par. We had just moved from LA at that time and LA has such a great variety of authentic Chinese restaurants that we really were not impressed by Joe's Shanghai at all.",0
"Omg, so much MSG my throat is dry the next two days.

Joe's Shanghai is known for their soup dumplings/xiaolongbaos. The meat is super soft and there is darn good piping hot soup residing inside the dumpling shell. BUT (yes there is a but), there's too much excess skin for my liking, thus creating an ultra saggy and unpleasant looking dumpling. I've had better but this is pretty solid for NY standards.

The jelly fish was overly chewy and unmemorable. #chewingfordays. I'd skip.

The crispy pepper duck was too dry and overcooked, definitely not what I'm accustomed to.

The pan fried noodles had too much noodle and not enough sauce to coat and soften the noodles.

The fried rice cakes were bomb and delicious on day 2 (leftovers).

The scallion pancake was crunchy and pretty darn savory when dipped in sauce.

Clams with scallion and ginger was light and refreshing. Very 清 and the best pick of the night!

Overall, Joe's is pretty standard. It's your typical Chinatown restaurant with the addition of above average soup dumplings. Oh yeah, CASH ONLY!",0
"Soooo it seems like this is where the locals go, but when you look around, there seems to not be any Asians insight except for the workers (the case when I went at least). So what does that say about the food? It was an interesting adventure, I would go with someone experienced if you dare to enter. They are a very fast paced restaurant and will give you a ticket for your place in line. Expect to be seated around a round table with multiple groups of people. This makes ordering a little interesting and conversations directed across the table.

The food was all okay for me, nothing super outstanding. They're popular for their soup dumplings of course. I do have to say the portions were decent at least. Their menus could use an update and some pictures. Also, CASH ONLY! I wouldn't come back when there's so many other places in Chinatown to try!",0
"Very tasty, and renowned for their soup buns, which are well worth coming here for. But expect to wait in line, and sit at a crowded, noisy, shared table.

The reason why their soup buns are so good is because the super thin skin is tough enough to not break while picking it up with your chopsticks. When you bite into it, hot, oily (yes, a bit unhealthy, but tasty) soup comes gushing out. It's best to nibble at a little corner, and slowly suck out all the soup. I like mine with vinegar too, but thats a personal preference.

Their other food is more Americanized, and not spectacular. I would stick with the soup buns. Oh, and not all the waiters will understand you if you speak English to them.",0
Extremely bad food and bad service. It is not worth the wait. They gave us table for two next to a dust bin - this is not how you treat customers who wait for an hour. The food was not cooked well and priced high,0
I worked in Shanghai about one year. Joe's Shanghai has the similar food. I have to say it is real Shanghaine food. Kind of sweet. Some of my friends are fans of this. So I came here several times since the first try. Cons: Limited space. Not clean enough. Kind of noisy. Sometimes you need to wait.,0
"Not impressed the second time around. Was there about 3 years ago and the soup dumplings were delicious. This time around the broth was salty as all hell and over reduced. Also most of them were stuck together making it a nightmare to get apart without breaking. 
And here's my main tip if you go here. Try the soup dumplings if you must but do not even dare ordering any dishes unless you like throwing your money away. It's clear they are hanging their hat on the mediocre dumplings and everything else is given absolutely no effort. There's much better places to spend your hard earned money.",0
"I don't know what all the fuss is about.  We waited an hour and a half (for a party of 11) and honestly, I have had better XLB and better Chinese food.  That is not to say the XLB was bad, it was just OK.

The dumplings have a thicker skin than I'm used to and the soup is not as flavorful as I had expected.  The dumplings are however, huge.  The crab dumpling was slightly better and only because you can really taste the crab.  We also had green beans and Shanghai noodles which were meh.  The green beans were too soft and the noodles were dry.",0
"Is a wait time of 30 minutes worth it for Joe's Shanghai? I've had my fair share of soup dumplings and to see an establishment that's as busy as them really boggles the mind. To answer my own question earlier; absolutely not. While the soup dumplings did succeed with soup/meat ratios and flavor, I couldn't get over the fact that the dumpling skin was extremely sticky towards my lips. I checked to see if my lips were chapped, they weren't, thank goodness. 

My wife and I had to share a table with a group of people which is understandable considering the volume of clientele going in and out. One idiot group member at our table asked the server ""why do we have to share a table?"" I simply looked at her and proceeded to take our seats... Don't want to digress further, but let's all be honest to ourselves and know that soup dumplings is a relatively simple comfort food. The fact that there's so many people going to eat the same, just doesn't make sense. I could get the same quality, possibly better price, and not have to wait.",0
"One of the worst Chinese place I have ever been to in the states and yes I am a Chinese. If you want actual Chinese place food, this is not the place to go.",0
"This place is ridiculously overrated.

The skin on the soup buns was too thick and tough. They tasted like they were sitting awhile between being made and being steamed. The jellyfish was blah. The noodles with peanut sauce were passable, but I could do better then that at 3AM after a night of partying in my own kitchen. Combine that with absurdly rude service - unforgivable!

Never again. Noodle House in Flushing - here I come!",0
Oh god! It was horrible experience. The round table has to be shared with bunch of other groups when it's crowded and they didn't let us know until we got inside. They only try to make money and don't consider its experience and the service  at all. I'll never go again,0
"Be honest, I'm not sure why this place is so popular!

Since I'm in Chinatown, it will be unfair for me to judge the environment! You will know once you visit there! (Wink)

Food quality, the soup dumpling skin (white dough) is very thick. I'm from Asia, and soup dumpling is the thing for me!  But I'm totally disappointed with their soup dumpling!  However, their service is pretty nice!  Surprise surprise!!!!! Especially from Chinatown!",0
"I've been here several times and the last time I went I realized this place isn't ALL THAT. The only decent things are the scallion pancakes and the dumplings. The people that work here are rude though, which makes me not enjoy it so much.",0
"Came here with family to sample some of the ""best soup dumplings in the city."" I was a little scared of the wait, but our 25 minutes quickly turned to 10 and we were seated at a table with another couple. We were just looking for a quick snack, so we ordered both the pork and crab meat soup dumplings as well as a dish of sautéed pea shoots.

I had high standards for the soup dumplings because of its reputation and unfortunately, I was disappointed. To be honest, the dumplings didn't have too much flavor. The meat inside the dumplings was fairly plain tasting and didn't have as much spice as I expected. The soup was a little oily. Also, the crab dumplings had a more of a fishy flavor than a fresh seafood flavor. Other than the relatively cheap price, these soup dumplings weren't all the rage for me. The pea shoots were good, but honestly, it's hard to make them incorrectly. And for $13 for a dish, I thought it was insanely priced.

If you're looking for a relaxing dining experience, this is not the place for you. First, if you are a smaller party, you will most likely be sitting at a table with another couple, which was the case for us. It was a little squished and to be honest, I almost grabbed some food from one of their dishes, mistaking it for ours. The wait staff there is fairly attentive, but to the point that your meal feels rushed. The constant hovering made me feel uncomfortable and made me feel like they wanted me out as fast as possible. I understand that you must try and accomodate numbers as much as possible but not at the expense of the customer experience.

If you've never had soup dumplings before and want to say, ""I've been to Joe's,"" then come. Otherwise, save your time and money and try another place.",0
"I was in NYC for the weekend and heard that Joe's Shanghai was famous for the xiao long bao. I was super excited to eat here, but I guess I should have known that it wouldn't meet my expectations. 

We did end up sharing a table, but that wasn't a problem at all. The servers are very, very busy so it's hard to track them down at times. But we ordered a couple of orders of xiao long bao, shanghai fried noodle, and a fish dish. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of the fish dish but it was just AWFUL and inedible. We didn't eat it and tried to explain to the staff that it was disgusting, and they ended up taking it off the bill. As for the famous soup dumplings, they really were average, or even a bit below that. The skin on it is a bit thicker than the average dumpling, so it really affected the overall taste of it. I think that the most delicious xiao long bao has to have the perfect combination of skin, soup, and meat that blend together and melt in your mouth. This definitely did NOT hit the spot. 

BUT besides the mediocre food at this restaurant, I really do like Chinatown in New York. It's a great neighborhood to buy souvenirs, bargain for T-shirts (especially if you're buying a bunch), and just walk around. In fact, while waiting for our table (there IS a long wait), my friend and I walked around the corner and got a 15 minute foot massage.",0
"I come here to satisfy my soup dumpling craving. They consistently make good, reliable soup dumplings but the pork ones only. The crab/pork ones tend to be far too fishy. 

I can't really speak on most of the other food since I really only come here for the soup dumplings. The scallion pancakes and the salt and pepper calamari were just ok. There is always a line but with a handful of people like me just getting soup dumplings, it goes quick. We usually come here for dumplings then eat dinner or dessert elsewhere.",0
"TLDR: Tables are cleaned with spit!!!

Came on a snowy day with a friend and had soup dumplings and beef pan-fried noodles which were both okay. The pan-fried noodles were served on a big plate which was very deceiving. The actual portion was very small. They only put a ring of noodles around the beef and vegetables in the middle of the plate and when you mix the noodles into the sauce, the portion is only enough for one person. The waiters were also a bit much. My friend and I had just put our coats down on the back of our chairs and didn't even have a menu open when the first waiter came to ask us our orders. I don't know what they expected, but we asked for more time. This was a constant theme during our experience here. Our order of soup dumplings came out first and we had wanted to keep the cover of the container it came in, on top to preserve their warm temperature. Immediately after taking out 2 dumplings, a waiter came by and opened the container to see if there were any dumplings left as he was trying to take it away from our table literally 1 minute after putting it down. I'd understand if it was a busy day but the restaurant was 70% filled and we had just gotten the dumplings. The waiters constantly came to our table to take miscellaneous objects away during our entire meal which was very uncomfortable to feel like we were always being watched. 

To top it all off, as we are about to leave the bill comes with a service charge of 18% already included. I've never seen a service charge for a table of 2. Confused, we looked around to see if a nearby table of 3 has left an additional tip after paying their bill. They haven't, so we now know that the 18% service charge is in fact the mandated tip baked in. However, as we watch the waiters ""clean"" the table that has just left, we saw them purposely spill the tea from the previous customers onto the table and proceeded to use a rag to spread and wipe it across the entire table surface. Once the SPIT, BACKWASH, you name it, was smeared everywhere on the table and dried, the waiters proceeded to place the new dishes onto the table for the next customers. Less than a minute later, a couple was seated at the table, with no clue that they were setting their belongings and hands on a table smeared with someone else's spit. This is absolutely DISGUSTING and incredibly IRRESPONSIBLE to do especially when we are in the middle of a pandemic. We almost gagged because we had put our masks and hands on the table when we were dining and the very likely possibility of someone else's germs and spit on us is atrocious! This calls into question the restaurant's other ""cleaning"" practices including their dishes, cups, and utensils that you'll be using when dining here.",0
"If I were to rate the soup dumplings, I'd give four stars. They are reliably decent, especially if you come really hungry. Unfortunately, I find the other food really salty and greasy.",0
"Every time we pass by Joe's Shanghai, we always see a long line of patrons so we never bother to eat here. But last week, surprisingly Chinatown was empty and we only saw a group of five or so people waiting to be seated. So my husband and I thought, ""hey, let's see what's with the hype of this place!"" 

Seconds after we got to our seats, a waiter asked whether we'd like some dumpling soup. I was irritated by that (we hadn't taken off our coats and touched the menu) and sort of regretted my decision of eating here. We declined the offer because of dietary restriction, but that didn't stop other waiters from asking the same question. Don't they assign tables to the waiters??!! :( 

We ordered Shanghai tofu (basically mushroom and tofu with dark sauce, sweet taste and served cold), calamari in black bean sauce (plain, nothing special), and sichuan beef stew (the beef was tender, not bad...). On the scale of 1-10, I'd give a 5 for taste and presentation. I think we might have ordered the wrong dishes, because most people around us ordered the dumplings; they must be good, but shouldn't there be more tasty food served in this so-called most sought out place in Chinatown? 

Not only we're disappointed by the food and the waitresses, we didn't appreciate being put at a table that's only inches away from another table. We could hear every word said by the patrons next to us. The noise level in that restaurant was unbearable. I've been to crowded restaurants, some are much smaller than Joe's Shanghai... I couldn't wait to get out of the place. 

The final verdict: not going back again, and will not recommend this place to anyone.",0
"I grew up loving this place as THE place to get soup dumplings in NYC but I've back a few times in the past 6 months and was rather disappointed. Maybe the quality has gone down in the past few years? Or maybe I've just been spoiled rotten by the recent opening of other, better restaurants in Chinatown. 

When I go, I usually order the crab and pork soup dumpling and another dish of beef noodles. The beef noodles are an oily mess of flavorful thick noodles - so slimy yet satisfying. The soup dumplings come out piping hot but some of the soup dumplings didn't have SOUP which is strange for a place famous for its soup dumplings. For the 30min-1 hour wait, I expected better soup dumplings. 

Also note this place is cash only and it's mostly all communal seating, so you'll be sharing a table with other groups. This place also feels extremely touristy - there were few Asian people actually at the restaurant. 

I'm not sure if I'll be coming back because there are definitely better places for soup dumplings in Chinatown.",0
I truly don't understand all the hype. The soup dumplings were very average. We only tried the pork ones (5 out of the 16 didn't have soup in them) and they lacked flavor! The soup inside was average and the pork was not seasoned enough. The soup dumplings at Shanghai Cuisine are far superior! We had the Lo Mein that was tasty and General Tso's chicken was good as well.,0
"Joe's Shanghai...the only reason why you guys even get 1 star is because I didn't have a choice because Yelp wouldn't let me continue your review without selecting stars.

I will just say, that this place is a major tourist trap. I am a tourist and I do not live in the NYC area, however, I do come around to visit family pretty often. And this, my friends, is how I fell victim to the hype of the glorious Yelp reviews. People, THE HYPE IS NOT REAL.

Let's start with the service. At your typical ""Chinese"" restaurant, there's not much service (I'm Chinese, I totally get it). It is what it is. However, this place has absolutely non-existent service. The server did not say one thing to me. When I was ready to order, he stood there and stared at me with his notepad and pen. So I'm thinking, I guess this is the part where I order. Once we ordered, he just walked away and didn't say anything. 

Our food starts to come...Xiao Long Baos and the Shanghai Noodle Soup, but our String Beans came when we finished our food. What the hell am I going to eat with my String Beans? Does this mean you want me to order a cup of your overpriced white rice? That, my friends, I did not do. Also the Xiao Long Baos appeared to have been sitting around for awhile because the skin was dried, and a few of them were popped, so all the soup was flowing out.

Also, we sat at a shared table with some French people visiting. When their meal ended, the server walks up to both parties, points at their check/tab and says ""Are you done?"" while they're trying to figure out our US Currency. Dude, they were trying to get you your money, but you had to be rude about it and say ""Give it to me."" Yeah...that leaves a good impression for us Americans. And with that, they pretty much rushed me out too.

By the way, they automatically charge you 15% tip (no matter how small your party is). They take the food total, plus the 15% tip, then tax that total. Can you say, ""Scheming?""

When they were clearing out the table, one of the servers drops one of our spoons on the table and splashes some sauce on me. Dude picked up the spoon and walked away. Really? Nothing? Like nothing? You could have said sorry? Umm...guess not.

All in all, as I mentioned above, THE HYPE IS NOT REAL. If you ever make it out to SF, check out Kingdom of Dumpling. Joe's Shanghai has NOTHING on Kingdom of Dumpling. Put those two places in one city, and sorry, Joe, you're done and SOL.

On a final note, I've had better all around service in Hong Kong, seriously. TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!",0
Very disappointing. The food and the service have come way down over the years. Not worth the trip.,0
"Got to say I was looking forward to eating here with my friend Michele from China who's choice it was to come here.  We bothwere not so impressed, I didn't lead on that I wasn't enjoying the food though, didn't want to ruin the date.  The dumplings kept falling apart before they got to our mouths, they then brought out the wrong steamed fish and the pork dish wasn't up to par as well.  We should have stuck with the wrong fish bc the white fish that they finally got right wasn't good at all.  Very disappointed, the saving grace of the night was walking around the block for ice cream at The Original Chinatown Ice Cream Factory...yummmmm...",0
"Food was decent, service was atrocious. We were seated around 8:45pm, didn't get our food until almost 10pm after multiple reminders, and immediately were given To-go boxes and the check. We didn't even finish half the food by the time they were rushing us out. It also took them forever to take our order as I was trying to get there attention, despite there being a bunch of people working on the floor. Organization was just horrible and it didn't seem like a well-established restaurant. I actually rly enjoyed the crab XLB though. Noodles are extremely oily and not special. Green beans were soggy, no crunch, but at least not too oily. Really not impressed by this place.",0
"This is just a spot to rip off tourist. Food does not live up to its hype. If you are craving for Shanghainese food/ soup dumplings...just go down a block or two down Mott and there are plenty of better Shanghainese food with fraction of its cost. This place has a different attitude/mood towards you depending on your race. Yes, you read that correctly...your RACE.I am not even going to mention it any further as I am sure you can picture how nasty waiters/cashiers can ruin your appetite. Depending on your race, if they treat you well once you step...that means they know they are about to rip you off. I DO NOT recommend this place and support restaurants like this because you are kind of supporting their behavior that it is ok to do what they are doing. Meanwhile there are so many other Shanghainese around the area not too far a block or two that has quality food with fraction of its cost and WAYY better customer service that actually treats you like human beings.",0
Perfectly adequate Chinese food but you could find comparable dishes nearby at a lower price. They seem to benefit from a yelp-driven tourist hype. Good meal but probably won't return,0
"Waited over an hour! Safe to say the soup dumplings are delicious. I recommend going with a large party, faster to get seated and large portions for a good price. I think we ordered the wrong dishes. The pork shoulder was good but a bit bland in flavors and the noodles as well. I would Iike to try more. Authentic is always good!",0
"It's very disappointing. This restaurant is definitely OVERRATED. The service is terribly bad. The foods are just like what you expect in an average Chinese restaurant. I won't call it authentic Shanghainese. Nope. 

The restaurant automatically adds 15% service fee on your check ""for your convenience.""  I guess that is the root cause for such poor service. The waiters do not care much about their customers. We split the table with another pair of customers. The other half of the table came later than us, but got to order earlier. Later the waiter totally messed up two different orders. Both parties ordered the signature dumplings. The other pair of customers got it right away, while we waited for maybe 30 minutes. 

We had to remind the waiter SEVERAL times to get our foods. By the time we got the complete order, the other pair of customers already finished their dinner and left...

I assure you will find tons of Shanghainese restaurants in NYC better than this one. Again, it shocks me that this restaurant gets 4-stars review. That's OVERRATED. You would be wasting your valuable time if you expect a 4-stars restaurant.",0
Horrible service and food is not good. So overrated never returning. Dumplings were not even fully cooked.,0
"Apparently Joe's Shanghai is famous for their Xiao Long Bao's, AKA Shanghai Steamed Soup Dumplings. I by far preferred the pork meat soup dumplings to the crab meat soup dumplings, though the crab meat was a novelty to try. I wish the lettuce underneath the dumplings were more presentable and edible though, which they usually are at most Chinese and dim sum restaurants. This isn't quite the case with Joe's Shanghai. Overall, I would get the pork Xiao Long Bao for sure. 

The wait wasn't that long for us, though we did go on a random Thursday morning in September. The awkward thing was that the waiter insisted on seating us at a humongous table next to a man who was eating there by himself, even though the entire restaurant was pretty much open. I guess they do fill up by the afternoon, though it was kind of awkward and I would prefer a table for two rather than sitting with strangers.",0
Went there today to see what the hype was about. The famous pork dumplings are great but u def need another order of them. I also got vegetable fried rice and ginger chicken and they were fantastic. The only downside is that the service wasn't wonderful. The waiters were rude and treated customers with very poor hospitality. The restaurant also has a grade of B from the NYC health department.,0
Stay away from this place! Dumpling quality is not consistent.  I got stomachache after eating lunch at their restaurant.  We asked for two orders of crabmeat soup dumpling but one order came without any soup inside the dumpling.  Now I can tell those are leftovers!,0
"Over the years, the quality of the food has diminished. The soup dumplings are no longer plumpy and juicy. Most of the time, it's dry, I feel like it's been sitting there for hours. For how busy the place is, I would think that they make new batches every few minutes - not sure why it's coming out like that. The shanghai flat noodles are also no longer good. It's extremely oily and bland. Its very disappointing. The wait is usually very long because of tourists and you may need to share a table with someone else. Hopefully, there will be a change soon!",0
"This great New York Staple lives up to the hype. A super fun and chill restaurant down in the heart of china town. The reason you go is for the soup dumplings. They are awesome. Light pillows of dough stuffed with pork (or crab) and a a delicious porky broth. It is served with a side of what seems to me rice wine vinegar and soy sauce. Super tasty! Our table ordered dumplings, prawns in chili sauce (tasted like sweet and sour though) string beans( fresh and still had crunch) and a couple of soups to share. While the food was tasty wish it would have come with some rice and I probably could have ordered more food. A little pricey for Chinese food but definitely a fun trip",0
"Bring cash, no credit cards accepted. I had gen tsio (sp?) was good, average. My daughter had shrimp fried rice, better than average. Everything else was average. I'm from Missouri, sorry but I've had as good, better, at home. Place can use some updating and a good cleaning. We got seated quickly, but line began to form afterwards. With I could give it better, but they get what it is. Oh, and service fee of 15% is added to bill.",0
"I heard so much about Joe's Shanghai that I finally decided to check it out on my most recent visit to NY. My friends and I ordered a bunch of dishes that were very typical Chinese fare. My main reason for going though was to try the soup dumplings. They were definitely good and tasty, but I've had better... There are so many Chinese restaurants in Manhattan and Queens/Flushing that I feel like there has to be some other place that serves awesome soup dumplings. I think Joe's Shanghai just got really hyped up by word of mouth, but I left feeling a little disappointed.",0
"Came by the other day for a mid-afternoon snack in an attempt to try NYC's finest XLBs. To my surprise, the line was out the door at 3 pm. The experience consisted of a ~10 minute wait along with sharing a table with ~10 other random tourists.

Ordered the crab XLB and it was merely okay. Couldn't really taste the Crab. The skin was pretty thin and the soup was plentiful. 

...all in all, the xlb was merely okay. The service was quick and prompt ...although they were more concerned with the speed of churning out a seat rather than dining experience.

...they did pull a sneaky trick and inserted a 15% service charge when they presented me the bill.

~$8.61 incl tax and tip for the crab xlb.",0
"This place has great food, fast service and good prices. The only problem was our server couldn't answer any questions and told us to call him only when we knew what we wanted, I don't think many of the waiters spoke or understood English. Other than that Good Food.",0
Took an out of town visitor here based on a lot of great reviews I've read and was pretty disappointed.  It was fine... it just seemed kind of run-of-the-mill.  The pork dumplings were quite good I have to say.  But the chicken & shrimp in plum sauce and seafood noodles we ordered just seemed bland.  Also didn't love that our party of 3 was seated at a round table with 2 other people.  That was kind of weird.,0
"My girlfriend is not going to like my review because she thinks this is four stars but you know what I didn't like it that much.  I didn't dislike it, I just thought it was okay.  The pork dumplings with crab soup were tasty but the veggies had some black stuff on there which made me question what was it.  The noodles I ordered weren't great, it was just okay, and that is why I am giving it three stars.  There isn't much more I can say.",0
"Was decent, but a bit let down overall considering how many people gush over this place. The food is not bad, just very overhyped. The portions are quite large so keep that in mind if you decide to order multiple dishes. They're known for their soup dumplings, but honestly I think they were just average (and too big to eat in one bite). I know I've probably been spoiled by going to Din Tai Fung pretty regularly in LA, still haven't found anywhere that comes close to how great everything is there. 

The staff at this restaurant is on the cold side, not unfriendly - but not the most welcoming either. Our table was a little dirty and you could see oil and sauce splashed a little onto the walls. Also, they only accept cash, but there's an ATM out front.",0
"Me likey soup dumprrings at Joes  ^__^

No seriously, their soup dumplings are really tasty, cheap and fast.  

Everything else, I could take or leave.  The scallion pancakes were also tasty, but completely drenched in oil.  My twice cooked pork was incredibly salty and greasy.  Even the vegetable dishes were completely drenched in oil.  

After consuming more fat and oil than Oprah on a twinkie bender, I gasped for air as my palpitating heart tried in vain to pump much needed blood through my constricted arteries.  I could have died right there on the spot.  An autopsy would reveal elevated cholesterol and sodium levels due to a nasty bout with fried noodles in a mysterious brown sauce.  

In the eternal battle of my metabolism vs food, mooshoo pork will win out in the end. 

The prices were a bit higher than Joe's more modest china town neighbors, though the atmosphere was just as hectic and unnerving as the rest.  

You certainly won't be maintaining a svelte New York waistline dining on this sort of food every day, which is why I probably won't be back any time soon.",0
"3.5 stars

Probably would've given 4 stars if the food wasn't so damn oily. 

Was there on a Friday night and despite there being a line, my wife and I were seated immediately at a table which we shared with other ppl. We ordered:

Crab meat with pork meat steamed buns-extremely rich and flavorful broth but also fatty and heavy. 

Pork steamed buns-broth was still flavorful but thankfully not as heavy and oily as their crab version.

Fried rice cake with beef-sliced rice cake is one of my fave things to eat at Shanghainese restos. Their version was on point flavor wise but again extremely oily.

FYI: Come with a large group only if you don't mind waiting. All others, should come in groups of 2 or 3 to ensure little to no wait.",0
"Tourist trap. Incredibly crowded and loud, community seating with other patrons. Atmosphere turned me off so we left before eating.",0
"If you're just beginning your soup dumpling journey, fine, try Joe's. But there are far, far better quality Xiao long bao in Chinatown. I've tried around five different respected places' takes on soup dumplings, and Joe's lacks that rich broth flavor. I've also found several bits of crab shell in my soup dumplings here, and on one occasion, one arrived already burst.

If you want to really enjoy this delicacy, go to Shanghai Cafe or Shanghai Asian Manor.",0
"Unfortunately, this place is overrated and watered down with tourism. 

Scallion Pancake 5/5 delicious!
Soup Dumplings 4/5 yum!
Kung Pao Chicken 0/5 Absolute trash! 

What knocked a few stars off was the disgusting rubber chicken they use with absolutely no flavor. They have a C rating from dept of health. Lastly, they sat me next to the ""waiters station"" literally 12 inches from hearing silverware and glassware clanking in my ear. Be prepared to wait 30-45min outside.",0
"Oh yea, xiao long bao, soup dumplings.  Hen hao chi!

Joe's Shanghai is delicious for soup dumplings and the steamed buns good too, just like Shanghai.  I can't vouch for anything else on the menu, but I don't think anyone can...

Don't expect service, just expect great soup dumplings :)",0
The food delicious the problem only accept cash money ATM  to Spencer 3.50 the restaurant clean good  I love duck Pekín,0
"I am in town for work so I came alone. I was seated in 5 minutes. You get seated with random people at a table. I ordered the pork xiao long bao, a spring roll, scallion pancakes, and cold sake. The xlb was too doughy for me. You could also taste the fat in the broth. There was a ton of broth inside, but it wasn't was good as din tai fung. Also, the size is bigger than a mouthful. I ended up cutting away a lot of the dough. It was okay but nothing I would crave. They also didn't have any vegetable appetizer. The spring roll never came, but I was full from the xlb and pancake so I didn't complain.",0
"I've been here several times and although the food has consistently been good, my last dining experience left me underwhelmed. The steamed dumplings tasted funny.  The broth inside tasted like dirty water.  The chicken and beef dishes were okay.  However, I was really turned off when I used their rest room which smelled awful and was filthy but even more so the esthetics of their kitchen. It was incredibly dirty and unhygienic! I had been a fan of JS for a few years but as a result of the last visit I highly doubt I'll ever return unless they thoroughly clean up and/or upgrade that filthy kitchen! Sadly enough and to no surprise my fiancé got sick! He definitely will never go back.",0
"This was the first places I've dined in NYC where i said to myself... i can cook better than this. I ordered the Shanghai stir fried noodles (with chicken). It was in much need of seasoning, and - can you believe - it cost $21.50 (tax and tip included). The noodles weren't bad but they weren't anything special either, and the lack of ingredients made it less palatable since it was eventually just noodles and chicken pieces. 

Given we were a group of 10, I appreciate that they allowed us to have separate checks. (we all got separate things so that must have also made it easier). But gosh I can't wait to go home and make my own stir fried/lo mein.

To top it all off, I took a look around the restaurant and there were very few Asian diners, if that tells you anything.",0
"This place has our favorite soup dumplings and pork shoulder, but we are not a fan of sharing a big table with random strangers. The place is also crowded and the waiters can bump into your seats easily or reach over your head and may spill something.

Plus, this place is cash only! Be sure to stop by the bank to withdraw to avoid ATM fees!

We do prefer the other location by the Theater District of Manhattan, which is more grand in scale, decorated more nicely and has a bigger menu selection (plus hardly any wait). The soup dumplings here taste the same!",0
"Dude, I hate to say this, but I think this spot is overrated.  After many rave reviews from friends, I went way out of my way to eat here during my last visit to NY.  Braved the weather and the wait for some very good but not spectacular soup dumplings.  Places like these are kind of a dime a dozen here in California.  Though the dumplings at Joe's are huge and soup-y, more so than I've encountered before which was cool, I don't know if I'd go out of my way again.",0
"This place is always busy.  Yesterday was my second time here since we came here from VA and this was our first stop.  I think they been hyped up because of not many places offering soup dumplings but my husband and I have found several restaurants in DC/MD area where their dumplings are way more big and better.  It was still good but doesn't live up to all the raving about it anymore since we found some back home that tastes better. 

They are cash only so make sure you have some before going in or there's an ATM right down the street.",0
"Nothing special. Soup dumplings were good for the price but the chicken is not good, tiny portion and super expensive. Chicken bones in the vegetable noodles... The waiters are kind and free rice",0
"This place has very high reviews.  I had high hope.  I do realize people who live in different places, cities, or states do have differences preferences and tastes. For me who lived in California for 10s years, this place is not for me. 
Rather than saying delicious or not. I rather make a comparative so some readers can get a better idea.  
For me, My fav Dimsum is Elite restaurant in So Cal.",0
"Meh.  Everything meh.  Those ""soup"" dumplings just have grease and soy sauce inside, and taste little different from suburban Chinese takeout.  Except for being a bit Americanized, Joe's is no better or different than virtually any other Chinatown restaurant.  Tourists with flyover state accents, however, make for good comedy, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers at group tables, feigning blinders on to avoid contact with the strangers, or trying stale conversation (with the receiving party being annoyed sometimes), etc.  It's kinda funny to watch (we had our own table because of a large group, but still were up against other tables and could view it all).  Other than the comedy, there's no reason to go to Joe's.  Enjoy authentic food elsewhere, and the dumplings you could get in Levittown.  But, all that said, if you want regular stuff, Joe's is fine.",0
"One of the worst meals I've had in my life. Should have known when I walked in during lunch rush hour and there were like 3 parties and they were all white people. 

The soup dumplings were very bland. The broth was... didn't taste like anything. And they were too big and cumbersome to fit in your mouth or your spoon. 

The crispy beef was sliced too thin so all you tasted was the cornstarch and it was overly sweet. 

And servers don't have designated tables so 5 different servers were asking us the same questions over and over. Constantly interrupting our meal. No we don't need our plates changed every 5 minutes. My god.",0
"My wife and I checked out Joe's because of all the reviews and it was close to our hotel.  We went around 9pm (they close at 10) and were quoted a 40 min wait time, so we just ordered there for take-out. 

Food came out pretty quick.  We got soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, General Tso chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, and Szechuan beef - total was about $100.

The General Tso's was not fried and crispy, but instead mushy and lacked flavor.  The scallion pancakes were just okay.  The Szechuan beef was pretty spicy, which was nice.  Overall, not great.  There has to be better Chinese takeout in Chinatown.

TIP: They only accept cash. They do have an ATM on-site.",0
"Excellent Pork Chop House was closed for Lunar New Year, so I decided to try Joe's Shanghai, which apparently a lot of dumb people like.  The place is a tourist spot, so keep that in mind.  I ordered one of my favorite dishes, xiao long bao, and was extremely disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.  The consistency of the pork was like mush and the soup inside was thick.  Most items on the menu are way over-priced, so I got the pork chop noodle soup.  While the pork chop was tender and quite good, the noodle soup was pretty plain.  It's pretty much noodles in a clear broth. 

Thank god this place doesn't deliver.  Don't believe the 3,4, or 5 star reviews.  Those people probably don't know what they're talking about.",0
I have seen so many recommendation about this place so i was expecting a lot... Abd was REALLY disapointed! Food wasn't good or either fresh...,0
"OVERHYPED.
Way too crowded and food was mediocre. Half the menu was crossed out. There was only 2 types of soup dumplings. We decided to try the pork and crab meat and it tasted so weird. The flavors did not go well together. The only thing I liked was the pan fried pork dumplings. We also had an order of seafood pan fried noodles. The pan fried noodles look and taste nothing like the other places you would usually get it. It was thick, chewy and bland. 
Yes, it may be an original hot spot. But it probably tasted better back then than now. Now it's just a tourist site. If you take a look around you, what do you see or rather what do you NOT see? Asian customers. The local Asians know where the best Asian foods are and it's not here.",0
"I used to drive to nyc from DC just for these soup dumplings. They're just not that good anymore. Not bad just not like they were. Over cooked and tough, the pork dumplings I'd have to think about ordering again. The ones with crab tasted good enough but again over cooked to the point where they were all sticking and impossible to pick up intact. They still have a line out the door, though, so maybe it was just a bad day.",0
"Examine your bill carefully, I found out they over charged me after I left.  I order 2 dumplings 15.90,  1 Scallion pancake 2.95 & Shanghai noodle 8.95.   Total is 27.80,  but my bill shows 35.44 & I paid it without thinking.  Not sure what they add on to come up with extra $5 after tax unless they automatically add-on gratituity.  Feels ripped off so be sure to check your bill.",0
We had the soup dumplings and they were so so.  The dumping went from two thick to breaking and useless.   Din Tai Fung is the gold standard.  These were sadly more like tin.   I have three because i am sure some of their other dishes should be better.,0
"Very good, but maybe not worth the wait and the hype. Crab soup dumplings are something to search for...these were very good. The rest is just a dirty old Chinese restaurant.",0
Just a ok. We ordered the regular suspects and everything was very average. Nothing stood out as being great or even really good. Our party of 7 had to share a big table with two other groups. Typical Chinese service. Soup dumplings were big and had a lot of soup in them but over the taste was underwhelming. Sorry but I was not impressed.,0
"This was my second time here and unfortunately was not any better than how I remembered it. As a party of 3, we had to share a table and we were rushed (granted the place does get very busy). 

And I'm sorry...maybe it's one of those acquired things, but it just smells bad. I believe it's that vinegar sauce that has probably seeped into the carpet over many years...

I like soup dumplings but the soup just tasted greasy..the food overall felt heavy and oily. The turnip appetizer was good though!

So many better hole-in-the-walls to go to in Chinatown though...",0
"How do u say OK in Chinese? you say Joe's Shanghai! 
         I took a 3 hour bus ride from boston to get to this joint! I woke up pretty early just to catch the ""china bus"" (coined by my japanese friends) and after some fast paced walking Joe and his kung fu waiters greeted us.  The place being super packed we sat next to these uber-geeky tech nerds from NYU! The hong kong cats raved about it as they ate! The white buy with them kinda just picked at his food! so what was i to think?
        And my thinking was OHNOMEDONOBOWDIS! And that day i was thinking in chinese. I have never tried shanghai style dumplings so i was super madonna like a virgin this whole she-bang! But besides that the dumplings were fat! they were juicy! and they made mouth's water! It just wasn't mine! i think we had two or three different kind of dumplings that day. People seemed to rave about it. but i wasn't really accustomed  to the taste. but i did feel like Bruce Lee was watching over me. He would have been proud...and he would have found them great!  So with that. I made like Cane in Kung Fu and left to wander the world...",0
"XLB skin a bit thick, but the soup was flawless. We had pork and crab and plain pork. Cash only establishment, expect to wait at all times but the food comes out fast.",0
"Over hyped in my opinion. The effort to get cash out of their ATM is a reason alone on why you should maybe not consider spending money here. The dumplings were nothing special, they hoenstly tasted like Trader Joe's.",0
I can get better chinese in any takeout place in the boroughs! Do yourself a favor and save the subway fare.,0
"This was the only restaurant that had a line outside so I thought we were in for some great dim sum. You tell the hostess how many in your party and she gives you a number. However, the order in which she calls your number seems completely random (there were people with the same sized party as us, who had an earlier number but we were seated before them). The prices were low but I was not impressed with their food--especially the highly reviewed soup dumplings. Perhaps it's because we're from San Francisco and live on a street with much better dumplings, put stickers, noodles, etc. My boyfriend wanted to eat here so I'm happy to have gone once but it's not a place i would return too.",0
"My friend and I came here for just soup dumplings. Since we were a party of two, we got seated with other random people. It's pretty hectic in there and servers aren't that attentive. As for the food, the soup dumplings were yummy. Good amount of soup. But the dumpling was a little doughy. Overall pretty good though! They only take cash.",0
Overrated!! Its a tourist trap. They pay the tour guides to bring people there. Service is rude. There are better tasting dumplings around town.,0
"Very authentic place in the heart of Chinatown. They have shared tables so be prepared to share your table with some strangers. When my friends and I popped in on a Saturday around 4:30 there was no wait but the place was pretty busy. By the time we left an hour later, there was a wait list and groups of people waiting outside. 

After reading reviews about the dumplings at this place, we of course had to order some as our app. It was very different. I've never had steamed pork dumplings like these. They were pretty good but not amazing. It was more fun trying to figure out how to eat them. We also ordered the Kung pao chicken and seafood pan friend flat noodles and they were delicious!

The service was fast and staff were pretty friendly. I'd come back.",0
"Overhyped. Food is not so great, it' alright. 15% service charge extra other than the tax?? I dunno if it's a New york thing but we Cali boys are not used to it",0
"We went to the restaurant at 12.pm .they got a lot of table. We ask the host for a small table because we only have 2 people. But the host told us we must had a round table to share with someone.And she told
Us that is your only choice.so we choice to left.never come back again",0
"Honestly I feel like this place is way too hyped. Don't get me wrong the soup dumplings are awesome but to wait an hour I need to SERIOUSLY be craving them. After waiting an hour (in the cold) we finally got in. We ordered scallion pancakes to start which were the BEST I've ever had. I would've ordered 2 orders of it it was delicious. Then we had the infamous soup dumplings which were delicious - the soup tasted so good, the dough was thin which is great because thick dough makes it hard to enjoy. Lastly we ordered the king pao chicken which was absolutely terrible. The chicken was so shady... it wasn't spicy... barely any flavor. Just not worth it. I gave this place 3 stars because of the longest wait I've ever experienced, where we sat (right next to the trash and dirty dishes and a couple that was as hardcore fighting), and the fact that I can find amazing dumplings at other spots. Enjoyed it but not moved.",0
"xiao long bao! 

they're great here but definitely taste completely different from the traditional ones they make in shanghai. the ones here have a broth that tastes much more buttery but they're good in their own unique way. 

also, in order to make things move more quickly, you might get seated at a shared table with random strangers. just a heads up.",0
"So my friends and I went here and we got two different tables. One table got better service and better tasting food than the other. Only difference was race, I can't say much more but this is nyc this shouldn't happen. Staff weren't happy when my minority friend picked up the checks for both tables.",0
Food was great as usual. The major issue was I saw one of the service staff leaving the bathroom immediately after flushing and there is no way he washed his hands. The sink and air dryer are very noisy and it would take at least 5 seconds to complete that process. Gross!,0
"Standard pre-frozen chinese food; check out Shanghai Asian Manor instead. Joe's is expense for what it is, long wait. Residents will come here mid-week to avoid the wait.",0
"The food is good. However, the dim sum menu is very limited. The other items are the typical American Chinese food items; they are well made with quality ingredients.. Also cash only FYI.",0
"Decent experience, but nothing amazing.  Friendly staff, quick service.

Potato pancakes with scallions were amazing.  Pork ""soupy"" dumpling were very good, but mis-named as pork buns (and we really wanted pork buns).  Chicken and shrimp in plum sauce was good, but too much bamboo and bland flavor.  Beef and string beans was good, but also just bland.  We had requested the schezuan string beans and pork, but to replace the minced pork with beef.  Waiter said it would cost more, which we ok'd.  I think we just got the standard bon-schezuan green beans and beef.

Canned coke and iced tea, and bottle beers.  15% gratuity included on bill.

I would try another place next time, but if you've never been, it may be worth a visit.",0
"I've been to many soup dumplings restaurants but this one, I have to say, is overrated. The crab dumplings are ok I mean but u can find them with better quality and cheaper at Nanxiang Restaurant in Flushing. Plus, this place charged u 15% service fee for basically no service.",0
"Don't expect good customer service if you come here and they will seat you in a table with other people. Must try the dumplings they are as good as the reviews here mention.

Noodles were bland. Jellyfish delicious treat to try.",0
I got nightmare food poisoning after eating here! Stay away!,0
"Was not blown away. I liked the potato pancake. I would get that again. There are no vegetarian options for the soup dumplings, just so you know. They are all about efficiency and getting the most customers in at a time instead of service. It's pretty comical the extent they will go to get the customers inside. I waited for 45 minutes with a number. It was crazy. Potato pancake, yum. Wish I could it to-go to avoid the wait and service drama.",0
"Joe's Shanghai was a decent Shanghai restaurant. It's definitely a place for people who are new to Shanghai cuisine, since there are much better places in Chinatown for xialongbao's and Shanghai cuisine. 
The price was a little expensive for this type of restaurant, but the food was good at least. Highly recommend their Crab meat xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). We ordered the regular xiaolongbao, crab meat version, and braised pork shoulder.",0
"Okay...maybe I was expecting more but honestly if I tell you PF Chang... Yes the chain restaurant... Has fresher spring rolls, you know where I am going with this! Spring rolls were greasy little things, not very fresh. Pass. I live in MKE and gotta say our local Stone Bowel makes a better dumpling and that isn't saying much. They were ok, not great. Pork soup with soft noodle. Seriously buy some ramen at your local grocery store throw some stringy meat in in and call it soup. I love ramen but can buy this for 59 cents at Pick n Save. 

Super crowed with locals and tourist mixed. Wasn't horrible but I wouldn't go again. 

Derive is pretty bad also. Couple at our table, maybe French were treated so poly and it wasn't a language barrier.",0
"It's OK. I've had xiao long pao before. 

The beef tendon noodle was average as well. Not bad, but not special.",0
"I was introduced to Xiao Long Bao probably 10 years ago by an ex. She was older and more travelled than I was at the time XLB and it changed my life. She told stories of thin dough, not weak, but still ever so slight chew. A broth so complex you'd think it was a reduction or a jous and pork frolicking with crab inside. The best of all dumplings and quite possibly the best pasta of any kind.

I'd been going to DTF (Din Tai Fung) for a while now driving from San Diego to Alhambra, yeah 100 miles away for a singular dish. I had high expectations coming here. After all NYC has the most Chinese American's and is like 5th by percentage. It's in Chinatown so I pretty much figured it would be good considering the # of reviews and how packed it was.

Service is typical Chinese restaurant (not fine dining). Flagging down for everything, but doesn't take away from the meal. You're a little grumpy having waited anywhere from 10 to and hour if you came early and more if you didn't.

Their XLB is larger than DTF, juicier than DTF, but the soup is fattier and not as complex and the skin is much thicker and chewy. The crimping is sloppy, but not functionally sloppy. Sesame seed noodles have good flavor and a slight aftertaste that doesn't linger. Good body and bounce. The hot and sour soup was thick, almost chunky, but not in a slurrie thickened sort of way and actually a little bland for the consistency, minimal depth. Scallion pancake was greasy and delicious in it's own way, soft, crunchy. I would murder that with some naan and hummus or bitchin sauce/majestic garlic spread. Drunk food for sure. I playfully called them gravy long bao's because the soup was so fatty. And I know your all thinking it now, what about real gravy, I've tried it and it doesn't work. I've got chef friends of mine playing with that flavor profile already, but if you beat me and them to the invention it's all yours. 

You marvel at the community around you since you use communal tables, everyone enjoying their dumplings lost in their own worlds. Price for most dishes is pretty good, and not just for NYC or Chinatown, but solid making all your expensive places just overpriced. I had 3 orders of XLB and with my soup, noodles and pancakes I was stuffed. That's a meal for 2 normal people apparently, but suggested portions are for ninnymuggins anyhow.

Cash only, can get stuffy and hot, very crowded as it's fame perpetuates itself and continues to disappoint anyone whose been to DTF. It's solid for the area and very popular, but mediocre xlb is better than no xlb.",0
"XLB are the best in the city when they get them right, but every time I come, at least 2 in the basket have leaked out. 

Hostess gave us an attitude in the 3 minutes we had to deal with her. Servers were friendly (when I spoke Cantonese to them), but I also heard them giving other customers attitude, which is so not cool. 

There are much better XLB places, even in Manhattan, not worth dealing with the service and quality control issues.",0
"While I was looking for this place, I accidentally almost stumbled into Joe's Ginger, which I'm pretty sure just has a similar name to trick you into going in there. Anyway, we arrived at around 11:30AM on a Saturday morning for lunch and was slightly afraid that there would be a long line. I think we beat the rush, because around 12 it started to fill up and a line went out the door. The restaurant itself is pretty grimy, though that's kind of the standard for a lot of the authentic Chinese restaurants I've been to. The waiters are brusque and don't really seem to care to take your order or bus the dishes. One of them was chewing/eating something while taking our orders and when we asked questions, he would just nod or shake is head because his mouth was full. That's some unacceptable professionalism and I'm sure if Gordon Ramsay was there, he would have ripped off that waiter's head.

They ask right away whether you are here for the soup dumplings, since that is what they are most famous for. We had one of each, a set of 8 normal soup dumplings and a set of 8 crab-flavored soup dumplings. I read somewhere that the thick, gummy shells of Joe's Xiao Long Bao is pretty bad, but I like the thicker shell because that prevents them from breaking. The insides were very hot and juicy, the soup being perfectly seasoned and the meat being just the right portion. My entire family loved it, including my brother who usually complains for ages whenever we get dim sum or anything like it.

The rest of the dishes were nothing to rave about, however. The Crispy Pork with Salt and Pepper wasn't too bad, though a bit soggier than I would have liked - I love them super crispy and crunchy. The General Tso's Chicken was accompanied by cold broccoli (why was it cold?) and the chicken was made from white meat, which made it dry and unflavorful. The Chili Prawns were covered in a wonderful tasting sauce that was kind of like a spicy sweet and sour sauce but milder and with garlic. The shells of the shrimp were too tough though so it was hard to eat it without taking off the shells. The Hot and Sour Soup was pretty bad and I didn't like that at all. It didn't have that signature bitter taste and instead just... meh... I don't really know how to describe it. 

The soup dumplings are great and I would suggest people to come just for those bad boys and skip the ""authentic chinese food."" It is not worth the wait if you are here for anything other than the Xiao Long Bao.",0
"This place is good if you don't mind sharing  large round tables with complete strangers. 
The food is very good and it helps if you have some knowledge of what to order. I personally always go for 1-2 orders pork soup dumplings, rice and orange beef or tso chicken when in this cramped setting. The meal goes a little smoother if the surrounding strangers are friendly.
The location in Flushing is 10x better!",0
"What is all the hype? Yes greasy broth can be tasty, but overall quality of the soup dumplings are edible, but forgettable.  The Lo Mien noodles were ok but I've definitely had better as well.  I'll stick with the oh so much healthier and tastier Korean style steamed dumplings or dumpling soup.  Oh and cash only if you didn't know.",0
"I expected more from this place based on everyones ratings. I LOVE soup dumplings and although these were good I felt like they could have been much better. I was not a fan of the dumpling skin however the broth and meat inside were delicious. 

I also had the crispy fried beef and that was fantastic! The size of the entrees are quite large. I shared mine with my sister. I'll definitely try this place again because I'm hoping for a better experience.",0
"I believe everyone mentioned all that is needed to say. 

So, I'll just add...DO GO HERE WHEN VISITING NYC! and when you do, ONLY order their soup dumplings!

Our wait wasn't too long.  Although it was uncomfortable b/c it was a cold evening.  We were also a bit intimidated by the B Grade given by the sanitation department. B isn't that bad, I guess. 

And it wasn't. 

We had:
-3 spring rolls
-2 orders of pork soup dumplings
-Szechuan Beef with Bean Curd
-Singapore Chow Mei Fun

However, I am only a fan of their famed soup dumplings.  They also had a crab filling, which we haven't tried, but I'm glad we ordered the pork instead b/c I can't imagine how the broth would be for the crab. And I am also glad that I watched a video on how to eat them.  Being a voyeur also helped, considering that everyone else on our table ordered soup dumplings as well.  The pork broth was amazing.  Actually, I think it was the broth that makes this dumpling famous. (The dumpling itself isn't too special).  That, and it's really fun to eat!  I think I'll attempt to make these at home.  

The spring rolls were mediocre. Nothing special about them at all.

The Szechuan Beef with Bean Curd was alright. Definitely second best of the four items that we ordered.  But I have had better. 

The Singapore Chow Mei Fun was marked as spicy on the menu. The waiter also cared to warn me that this noodle dish was spicy.  That's perfect, honestly. However, when our order arrived, it looked like rice noodles spiced with curry powder--and that is exactly what it tasted like, also.  Don't get me wrong; the dish was good. I just thought it funny that I was basically warned twice about it being ""spicy.""


All in all, we had a great experience.  I would go back when I return to NYC, except I would only order their soup dumplings.",0
"Such slow service for an empty restaurant.
I asked for extra ginger in soysauce 3 times and they still don't remember.
Waited for 20mins for food, and the restaurant isnt even busy! 
They argued the xiao long bao takes 10mins, okayyy what about the noodles? 
All of a suddenly they can't argue anymoreeee.
Food was mediocre, i rather go to elsewhere.
Oh and tip is mandatory, included in the check! 15%
What kinda shitty establishment is this???",0
"I give this place 3.5 stars.  The soup dumplings were good but not absolutely amazing. I have had better out in san franciso.  We also ordered a black peppered duck, which was pretty good. It was a deep fried duck which we dip into salt and white pepper on the side.  Honestly dont see whats all the hype is about.  Have not tried any other places in new york to compare so maybe the best there.  I can say it is better than din tai fung for comparison.",0
"Their soup dumplings are pretty decent for NYC, but it pales in comparison to the soup dumplings at Din Tai Fung in LA.  This place is always packed, so there's usually a line for seating. I gave them only three stars because you get seater quicker if there is a white person in your party. If they know your party is all Chinese they make you wait longer. WTF????",0
"I am so glad I went because of the hype and many recommendations. 

I think I overordered and had just way too much food. Nevertheless, the soup dumplings were good. I didn't love them though, but I don't think it's because they were not well made, but just my own preference of the type of food it is. 

The General Tso's chicken was nothing special. 

I like the service but sharing tables with randoms was a bit weird, but not bad. Everyone was friendly at my table. 

Would I go back? Probably not.",0
"When I got there, I had high expectations because of the reviews. I grew up on Chinese food so my expectations are probably much higher than most. The wait was just a little over an hours which I did not mind waiting for good food. You must go inside to grab a ticket from one of the staff to be put on the list and receive a wait time! We had to share a table with other guests, which was a little uncomfortable but I completely understand due to their high volume. The staff weren't very attentive. I had to ask for water several times b efore he got it for me. I recommend getting what they are known for which is the soup dumplings. They were juicy and delicious but you much eat them right away! The stir fry noodle were good as well, had a chard flavor from the wok. But the beef noodle soup was terrible! There was literally no flavor. It just tasted like hot water tbh. Idk if that's a mistake or that's how they normally make it but I would never order that again. The sweet and sour fried fish was good. But the strong ketchup taste ruined it. I expected more from this place. Also, there is automatically 15% gratuity added on to the bill.",0
I have reached out to Bikeway to have mobile bike service performed on my bike at home. Over a month and no response.  Went into store to acquire why no response.  Store clerk told me he would tell Manager and I should hear from them. Going on 3 weeks and still no response. 845-297-5477,0
Service was slow and terrible. We ordered our food and waited 45 min for it. Everyone who came in at the same time and after us all received their food before us. Soup dumplings were bland and the spicy Szechuan beef dish we ordered was nothing but a dish of oil and string beans. Total disappointment. Not even worth one star.,0
"Stick with the soup dumplings - it's delicious but do not do take out. Huge mistake - the dumplings did not hold up. No soup in the dumplings - bursted during transportation 

Otherwise if you plan on ordering Americanize Chinese dishes - you're better off with from cheaper take out places 

Shanghai noodles were bland - just mainly noodles and a few pieces of pork. Oh. And TONs of OIL. Won't ever order again 

General tso's chicken - bland!! Boring - barely had any sauce 

Hot and sour soup just god awful - tastes plain sour dumped with white pepper

This place is only good food soup dumplings - won't would save your money and go to another restaurant if you want other Chinese main dishes 

Oh and everything is cash OnLy",0
"I was in the mood for something soupy and flavorful and wandered into Joes Shanghai anticipating some life changing shanghai dumplings. The dumplings were much larger than the ones I normally eat and they surprisingly asked me whether I wanted shrimp or pork? I got the pork and wasn't impressed. They were okay but I thought they were supposed to be amazing? Anywho, we also ordered a chow mein which was delicious! The noodles were fat with a different texture than what I'm used to. I wanted to pack up what was left and take it on the plane with me, but I thought - ""better not"". 

The food was alright and service okay. Be prepared to share table as they don't care whether you want to sit with your party alone.",0
"I've only been here for the soup dumplings, so I will consider coming back and leaving a review for more of the options. The soup dumplings were definitely really good! I've tried xiaolongbao in MANY places and this is one of the best. The service is okay, and it is definitely crowded, but I didn't mind too much. The prices here are also great, very much worth it. FYI, this is also one of those family-style restaurants so, if you're coming with a small group, prepare to share a table with strangers.",0
"Sunday late afternoon, my long exploration made a pit stop at Joe's Shanghai.  We walked from Union Square through Soho and ended up in Chinatown.  

My friend's had Joe's Shanghai on her food list venture.  She said that a lot of people told her the Joe's Shanghai has really good xiao long bao. Xiao long bao are soup dumplings with minced pork.   We ordered pork and crab pork.  As I took my first bite, I expected an explosion of flavor and excitement in my mouth.  No fireworks.  I was not impressed.  Not sure if it was all that hype from my friends and the long journey I had to get to Joe's Shanghai, my expectation standard was too high and it just didn't satisfy me.  The crab pork tasted almost the same as the pork.  I didn't taste any different.  Many it was an off day.  I'd give it another try if I make to the Eastcoast again.

Top notch service.  We were taken care.  Tea was brough to our table immediately after seating.  All the servers were attentive and not zoning off like some restaurants I've been to.  I asked for water and it came within 5 minutes.  Asked for the check, came in 5 minutes.",0
"Average at best. Granted, I di NOT have any dumplings which did look good but the rank and file food is average at best.",0
"I'm sorry people. It seems like this place is a hit for everyone. For me on the other hand... it was a bit of a dissapointment. (Please don't kill me =P)

My mother is shanghainese so I can be a bit of a shanghai food snob I admit it. It's ok. I work with it. One of the most popular dish in Shanghai is the Dragon Dumplings (xiao long bao). I'm sorry but it lacks flavor! MOST IMPORTANT PART!! MUST HAVE FLAVOR!! Sauce within the dumplings were ok. Skin around the dumpling too THICK! 
I heard so much about this so I expected to be able to enjoy some happiness and unfortunately.. I did not find it. Ai...

Everything else like the fat noodle (Chao nian gao), and other stirfry dishes was pretty good. So the place isn't bad. can't really go wrong with those right?

Gets super crowded though. Make sure all your party is there before they seat you. Until then.. I'm still looking for my yummy xiao long bao..
Ai.....",0
Food was good. You have to sit next to whatever seat is available meaning you can sit next to a stranger. Quick prompt service however bathroom and setting of the restaurant.,0
"both the soup dumplings were okay. but I heard it's best in town so it's good I guess

the Hong Kong sweet and sour soup - tastes ok

pan fried seafood noodles - no good. do not get.  if you want noodles, get stir fried or something where the noodles are soft

peppered shrimp - pretty good!

sesame beef - kinda sweet. I liked it

they automatically add gratuity to very bill because their service is really bad; if they didnt do that, no one would tip them lol",0
"I believe this place is a tourist trap.  The soup dumplings are fine and I think are middling in almost every way. I appreciate the effect that Joe's Shanghai has had on soup dumplings and New york Chinatown, but I think their quality does not stack up to other NYC dumplings spots",0
"The workers there were so rude. I ordered take-out and when my food was ready, the lady continued to watch her TV on her phone. I ordered the pork soup dumplings because of the hype for them. They were mediocre, nothing to brag about.",0
the foods are good..but always pack with customers which create problem for getting seat! the waitress is extreamly easy to forget your ticket # and skip you! the worst part is THEY DON'T CARE! so...take it or leave it...,0
"We had Joes Shanghai at their other location several years ago and it left us disappointed. After all the raves from our family and friends, we decided to stop by and give them ONE more chance. 

Parking is a bia in Chinatown so make sure you come with all your guests Bc they will NOT seat you if your whole party is not there. 

We had the crab soup dumplings, pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. The soup dumplings I believe were over cooked. It would break apart on you so you're left with just the dumplings Bc the soup had ether evaporated or it leaked out. Crab one tasted weird -- like gritty tasting. But the classic pork soup dumpling was good. The scallion pancakes were also delicious. It was crispy, just the way we liked it. 

My suggestion though is to change out the carpet because it smells really bad when you walk in there. 

I wouldn't mind coming back here but I hear there are several other soup dumpling shops in Chinatown that we wouldn't mind giving a try before coming back here.",0
"I've heard a lot of good things about Joe's Shanghai, so I had to take the chance to eat here during my trip. I came here with three other people, and we waited about 40 minutes for a table during lunch on Labor Day. We were finally seated at a large table alongside another party of four, which was a little unexpected but ended up not being too awkward. 

We ordered both types of the xiao long bao (pork and crab meat pork), stir-fried veggies, squirrel fish and spicy chicken. The xiao long bao were flavored well, especially the crab meat one, but I wasn't a huge fan of the size and texture - I expected smaller sizes and thinner dough (like what they have at Din Tai Fung), and these seemed more like soup buns than soup dumplings. However, the squirrel fish was flavored well, and was probably my favorite part of the meal.

Bottom line - the soup dumplings here don't taste bad, they just aren't what I'm used to - 1) they were way too big for the spoon and 2) the skin was super thick.",0
"Of my 15 years of living in NYC, I have never visited Joe's Shanghai until recently when one of my friend from California who is obsessed with them. So we agreed to go and I was also excited because it is very famous and it has tons of reviews on yelp. There was so many things that I was not happy with. 
1. the soup dumping was SO disappointing. the skin was thick but at the same time it would break when you pick up the dumpling. the soup it self inside the dumpling was meh, it tasted just like a regular dumpling flavor and that should not be the way it is. 
2. the wait staff is constantly eye balling you, kind of ""rushing"" you to finish up so they can clean up and get the next customers in. they literally stand right next to your table when you are almost close to finish and it just felt super uncomfortable. 
3. we also ordered some other Chinese dishes and those were so bland and being a Chinese myself I was just so disappointed.  

overall, i would probably never come back.",0
"Joe Shanghai's was way over hyped. My group of 6 waited nearly 50 minutes, despite the hostess originally saying the wait time was going to be 20 minutes. It didn't surprise me that we waited a lot longer since Chinese restaurants often do not provide the right wait time. We wanted to try their soup dumplings since everyone was raving about them, but were completely underwhelmed. The meat filling was a little too fatty for my liking and the dough used was okay. I expected something to the similar caliber of Din Tai Fung, but Joe Shanghai fell completely short. The only thing that saved our meal were the green beans. They are heavy on the garlic, but we're crispy on the outside! They were pretty good. We also ordered the pork noodles which seemed to use fresh noodles. If you're coming for the soup dumplings, I'm sure you can go to somewhere else where the wait will not be as long and be just as satisfied.",0
"Just stopped by Joe's and noticed that it has a ""B"" health department rating.  Thought you would want to know.  It still has a line waiting to get in.  I think I'll wait until it gets an ""A"".  Too bad, I was looking forward to trying the dumplings.",0
"This was our very first meal on our trip to New York and after a short wait (because we were willing to share a table), we were treated to a feast of classic Shanghainese dishes. Although very popular and well known, we found that the food was too oily and other than their signature dishes, there was something left to be desired. 
The dishes we ordered included: 

Xiao Long Bao - their most famous dish and for good reason. Thin skin, filled with soup and meat that was not too fatty but flavourful.

Potstickers - very good as well, nice skin and tasty meat filling. 

House Special Glazed Crispy Chicken - thinking that it would be a half chicken cut up we were surprised to see golden glazed chicken chunks that were battered and fried similar to sweet and sour pork. Served with broccoli, we were so surprised to love this dish. With white meat chunks that were not over battered in a perfectly sweet and tangy sauce, we finished the whole dish! 

Shanghai Fried Noodles with Pork - This was a nice sized portion of noodles that were stir fried with some veggies and pork strips but there was way too much oil.

Bok Choy with Mushrooms - wanting a veggie dish, we went with this classic. Nothing wrong but the sauce was too gloopy for me.

Lions head Meatballs - the least favourite dish of the night, we couldn't even finish it because although the portion was very large, the meat itself was not very good either being overworked or mixed to flour and much too fatty. Similar to the above, sauce was too gloopy.

Overall, I had high expectations for Joes Shanghai and was quite disappointed with the dishes that were not their ""classics"". For somewhere so popular I would have expected to be blown away but left feeling uncomfortably stuffed.",0
"Overrated, overrated, overrated, did I mention overrated?

I was super excited to try Joe's Shanghai after all the amazing reviews of how great there food is. I went there on a Saturday night and it was super packed. You go inside, give you're name to the lady and they give you a ticket....then you wait outside. 

Note: THERE IS A SIGN ON THE DOOR THAT THEY ARE CASH ONLY. BRING CASH.

When they sat us we were only two and I assume its ""family dinning"" so we sat with 6 other people on a large round table. At first it was very awkward, the two of us sitting with people we have never met but they were very kind and we enjoyed this ""temporary large family.""

We ordered scallion pancakes which were very good as well as the sesame chicken which I didn't see what was special about it. It was a standard sesame chicken. The rice they serve is really good, but the service was lacking. I felt myself needing to ask for everything from a cup of water, to a straw to napkins. 

The entire experience was overall okay. People rave about the dumplings but the only option was pork and we don't eat pork so that was a no go. 

Overall there was more hype surrounding the food than the actual taste. For the amount of men in the dinning room serving and walking around I would really expect service to be better. 
The oranges they bring at the end with you're check was nice. I believe there must be better Chinese food/dim sum in Chinatown.",0
"Not sure why this one has high ratings.  The food is mediocre.  We had XLB, rice cakes, string beans, crab tofu, chicken.  XLB was good (hence the two stars), the remaining dishes were rather bland.  Service was mediocre at best.  

Tried to order some traditional Shanghai favorites like 銀絲卷，Shanghai spare ribs, and many items found in traditional Shanghai cuisine, and they didn't even know what those are.  

If you are a tourist and not looking for authentic Shanghai cuisine, then this is ok.  Otherwise go elsewhere. 

Other notes:  the place is cash only, and tips are automatically added on at 18%.  The fact that tips are automatically added might have contributed to the fact that service was mediocre.",0
"Food - 8/10
Service - 6/10
Atmosphere - 4/10

First, the low marks for atmosphere are primarily due to the long touristy lines, NOT the fact that you are seated with strangers if you have a small party. I don't mind that.

Came here often when I first moved to NYC, and the soup dumplings are some of the best I've had. 

Overall good food. But upon walking in and seeing a swarm of tourists squirt pork juice all over their faces, one cannot help but burst out laughing while realizing this place has deteriorated into a trap. 

It is NOT worth the long wait. There is a nice restaurant 4 doors away on Pell St. called Shanghai Gourmet that serves identical menu items without a wait time. Or go to Shanghai Cafe on Mott St. which also serves decent soup dumplings. Also, those two nearby places are filled with only local Chinese - a clear hint that they have decent food, at the very least.

You'll get standard Chinatown service here, quick and attentive but sometimes rude. 15% tip is automatically added to your bill, CASH ONLY. Prices are fairly cheap.

Recommend:
Soup Dumplings (classic, I prefer the regular pork, not the crab ones)
Scallion pancakes (not as greasy as some other places)
Shanghai Fried Noodles (Shanghai Chu Chao Mian)",0
"We waited in line for some time before being seated. Which I thought was a good sign. I looked up the reviews prior to being seated and thought ""This place is going to be great!""

We were finally seated, we were asked what kind of dumplings we wanted even before ordering drinks. They really get down to business here. For the 8 of us, we ordered two regular pork and two pork with crab meat. They literally came out in a flash.

Once I bit into my first dumpling, I knew this wasn't the place. The filling was extremely salty and not that flavorful. I was disappointed. 

We also ordered: 

Shrimp Pan Fried Noodles - Too much sauce. Overwhelming.
Twice Cooked Pork - I thought it was decent.
General Tso's Chicken - Devoured by my table.
Salt & Pepper Calamari - Decent.
Mushrooms & Bamboo Shoots - Good.

Super disappointed.

When I return to this fantastic city that never sleeps, I will be sure to check out more of Chinatown to find the real hidden gems. Because this place is super overrated and not worth it at all. One good thing, is they have reasonable prices on some of the dishes. Another bad thing, is they only accept cash.",0
"service is not nice. got automatically charged 18$ for a group of 4
they even didn't notice the customer in advance 
never come back",0
The wait is insane for this kind of food.  I don't understand what the hype is about.  Service is rude and I can get better dumplings and noodles at East Dumpling.,0
"Perfectly good Chinese food...pork soup dumplings were quite satisfying...the smoked fish was good too.  I've been here twice for lunch and would go back.  Cash only. Yes, it's crowded, with tourists...and the staff is not very pleasant.",0
"Came here based on a friend's friend's suggestion. The soup dumplings is what we had to try according to most people. We ended up getting 2 orders, one of pork and the other crab. Both were tender and full of protein, but both lacked flavor. It was basically stuffed dumplings with lots of liquid in them and no salt or other ingredients. You had to use the soy sauce to bring in flavor. Maybe this was the intention but for me personally, I would've liked to taste more with just the dumpling and the sauce be an enhancer. The prices were reasonable for New York. Each order had about 7 dumplings each.

Overall, flavors weren't greatest so I wouldn't personally recommend this to anyone. But while we were there, it was packed and filled with a very diverse group of customers. It was somewhere in between clean and dirty. It was definitely authentic Chinese, with servers, menus, decor and overall vibe. It was very much a get them in and out as quickly as possible. Everyone was rushing including hostess and waiters. They could work on the customer service portion of their business.

Also, CASH ONLY!",0
Wait was forever and we were told we were next for twenty minutes straight and watched other people in front of us. Servers were rude and the food was really bland.,0
"Every time when I am in NYC I must come to this restaurant for best dumplings and pancake, I never have problem to add 15% tips for even one person ,  downside the service is very bad and waiter staff is rude. if Anyone come for a best dumplings don't expect any good service !!",0
"Was honestly disappointed :( 

My friends and I came here after a long day around the city and ready to eat, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. The food wasn't particularly bad or anything but it also wasn't particularly good to me. We waited about half an hour before we were seated around 6pm which was a lost faster than I expected; however, the seating is crammed and you have to share large tables with other parties. Not sure if I could come back here and wait again as the meal was pretty average to me... The food came out sporadically so we were eating vegetables by themselves for a good 15 minutes before receiving any of the dumplings that we got for our meal. The soup dumplings that we ordered came out to our table and weren't hot as well. I wouldn't say do not come here but I also wouldn't call it a must visit (contrary to other reviews)",0
Ordered the chef recommended Shanghai chicken broccoli was good chicken was ok . I eat out a lot probably wouldn't come back there's so many other places . Service was good ambiance is nice as well. Cash only spot.,0
"Disappointing experience. First of all, they make you share seats at the table with other people, even though the restaurant is 25 percent full. Then we had to wait for a while, whereas the locals were approached the moment they sat down and had a visibly better service: were approached more often even though we were sharing the same table and served by the same waiter (!). 

The Xiao Long Bao, or soup dumplings are not done correctly. They are extremely oversized. So it was hard to eat it my way - placing whole dumpling in mouth. I don't do that traditional routine where you break the dumpling and let the broth escape and then drink it separately - might as well order regular dumpling and a soup! Another moment, some dumplings were broken - so the broth leaked out. Also, don't select the dumpling with crab meat/pork - not worth extra money! Stick to traditional pork.  My Xiao Long Bao experience gained from Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, so I know dumplings.",0
"The xiao long bao (soupy buns, if you prefer) at Joe's Shanghai are just a short stroll from Apotheke. If stiff cocktails stir up your appetite, as they often do mine, this proximity could come in handy for you.

We were seated immediately, at a table already occupied by six diners. No matter, that's how they do things here (gotta love efficiency!) I did no ordering and left it up to my proficient dining companions who knew what we'd be having before we ever left the bar.

Half the fun of eating these soupy buns was trying not to spill the soup. S(he) who spills soup pays the bill. But I must admit, I didn't find the xiao long bao crave-worthy. We also had the baby bok choy and the pork and fried bean curd with jalapenos. 

All in all, a solid meal but nothing so memorable as to convince me to rush back to Joe's Shanghai.",0
"Maybe it's because I'm Chinese, but these xlbs are just alright to me. I liked them, but feel like it's a little bit overrated. I came here when it first opened in the morning and was able to get a table quickly. My friend and I ordered 2 orders of the crab and pork dumplings for $8.25 each (first on the menu). We liked them, but we agreed we weren't in love. Overall, good cheap meal, and worth trying!",0
"I only came here for XLB. I got pork and crab XLB. It was good but there were things I would have liked to be done differently. First of all the dumpling skin is thick! If you've ever had DinTai Fung in Socal it is almost paper thin. Secondly it is HUGE! It did not fit on my soup spoon and the soup kept spilling out. Which leads me to the soup. I thought that was very good. The filling was good too, reminded of a bun rieu crab/pork/shrimp meatball. I also did take out, took them less than 15 mins which was impressive considering the line they had waiting.",0
Mediocre food really. I've had better xiao long bao. Don't know what the hype was about lol.,0
"Food is not bad, very overrated , ok for tourists, I  eate crab Dumplings Shanghai Noodles and",0
"The wait time the hostess originally told us was 5-7minutes max. That wasn't the issue, though, we waited about 10-15 minutes, in this time there were 3 other groups of 2-3 people that were waiting behind my fiancé and I.. (let me mind you, we were all other ethnicities except Asian.) The 4th group that came barely got a number, and were seated before any of us within 2-3minutes and they were of Asian decent. The reason was because they ""had a group of 3 people."" But that didn't make any sense since the people behind us were a group of 3 and they were there long before them. Anyways long story short I walked out shortly after because thats just rude. I will not be returning to this place. I would not recommend to waste your time on this place when there are many more restaurants around who will treat you with more respect.",0
"Meh. we came here around 7:30 PM one night (Saturday) and the place was packed! I think we waited half an hour before deciding to go down the street to another restaurant, where we ate gleefully.

We did come back Sunday night around 9 PM and were seated in 5 minutes. The place was still pretty busy, and we shared a table with other diners. We ordered two servings of pork soup dumplings, crab dumplings, the seasonal vegetables (pea sprouts), turnip turnovers, and a noodle soup.

My family thought the dumplings were pretty good, but not worth waiting for. Crab dumplings were not as good. I thoroughly enjoyed my pea sprouts (which I always do) and we also added an order of fried green beans. Those were also very good. I didn't find the food too greasy at all. The only other thing I tried was the turnip pastries/turnovers. the pastry itself was really good. The filling would have been better, but it needed some salt. I was surprised they were under seasoned.

Eh. Wouldn't waste my time coming back.",0
"Being half Shanghainese, I have high expectations for XLB. Before going to Joe's Shanghai, a lot of people hyped it up for me but it did not meet my expectations.

There was a long wait and the restaurant was really cramped. I went with a friend and we were seated at a big table with strangers. The table was not big enough for the number of people that were seated at the table. 

I ordered XLB, the double cooked pork, and fried rice cake with chicken. The XLB wrapper was not thin enough. The XLB was too juicy. It was almost as if they purposely inject the broth in the XLB rather it being the natural broth that comes from the meat. The perfect XLB needs to have the perfect thickness of the wrapper and the perfect flavor of the meat filling. I prefer Din Tai Fung's XLB and some of the Shanghainese restaurants that I have tried in LA. Another dish that I ordered was the double cooked pork. It  was really flavorful and delicious. However, the portion was rather small and it was filled with mostly cabbage rather than meat. The fried rice cake with chicken is also good but my dad does a better job at making this dish. 

The service is also not that great. The servers try to rush you to order and through your meal. If I do come here next time, I would rather order to-go.",0
"I only come here for the soup dumplings. They are a good deal and are one of the best things i've ever eaten. However, my family only orders takeout now. The restaurant is very busy with tourists and the wait can be up to over an hour. Other then my favorite dumplings, the rest of the food is okay. The restaurant seems kind of dirty and the chairs are the old metal kind last time i went inside. Also, i don't really like sharing a table with a group of tourists that are looking at me the entire time. Last, the bathrooms are something i do NOT want to venture to. I recommend ordering takeout to same time and cleanliness.",0
"Both the pork and pork & crab soup dumplings were pretty good! They're not nearly as good as the ones I've had in Asia, but they will definitely suffice if you're craving some sizzling hot and cheap soup dumplings to fill your cravings. Please note that these are HUGE (quite ironic considering xiaolongbao literally translates to ""small"" in Chinese). I guess larger portions aren't really worth complaining about, but the size does make picking up the dumpling without ripping the skin or spilling the soup much harder...so be careful!

I also tried the Shanghainese fried flat noodles, fish and wood ear cooked in a Chinese wine broth (apparently very traditional Shanghainese dish!), and some simple stir fried veggies. Everything tasted fine but were a bit too greasy for my liking. 

Though the wait may look long, the line moves quickly as the restaurant is very fast at getting food out. You will unfortunately likely have to share a table. For some reason, the restaurant contains mainly large 8-12 people tables when the groups that come are usually between 2-4. If you're uncomfortable with eating so close to strangers, then you probably shouldn't come here.

I'd eat here again if out-of-town friends really want to have a no-frills dinner at a popular spot in NYC, but otherwise, I'll stick to the many other options in Chinatown for my dumplings.",0
"I don't understand what the hype is about. The food was not authentic - the soup dumplings were good but the rest of the food was just American Chinese that you could get at Panda Express. We waited for over an hour on a Tuesday to be seated, and only at a shared table. The waiters were very busy and you had to shout to get your order taken. Ambiance was very chaotic.",0
"Joe Shanghai, more like Schmo Shanghai.

This place is so overrated.  Upon arriving, the first I see is a 10 person line forming outside, what look to be about a 30 minute wait.  But my hot and steamy partner, hotter and steamier than any pork dumpling, got us a table in 30 second.

Sharing a table doesn't bother me much, neither does the rude wait staff.  I mean most Chinese restaurants have sub par wait service, but I think that's part of the charm.  But 15% gratuity regardless of service?  Ridiculous.  So be careful not to double tip, because even if you eat here by yourself, it's an automatic 15%.

The dumplings are average and inconsistent, and the casing seems to thicken as they cool.  The broth is salty in a not so good way and the meat is what it usually is at other places.  The seafood noodles ranges from bad to horrible, and is bland as can be.  

Regardless this place will be a fun time for you and your five best friends.  Come and have a rowdy time.",0
"It's not great.  It's good.  But, meh, I've experienced better.

Read everyone else's opinion, but honestly, if you know 小笼包 you'll know this place shouldn't be as popular or well rated as it is.  Plus, if you know Din Tai Fung, or if you've eaten at other XLB places in Taiwan, Hong Kong or Shanghai, then you also know what the gold standard is.  And the gold standard, being 5 stars, means this place is 2, which maybe 5 stars for NYC, but is 2 stars in the global context.  Ya feel me?

Yay, its cheap.  So I guess you could say you get a good cost to quality ratio there.

And the wait?  What a joke.  The hot pot place across the street is more delicious and more authentic a culinary experience.  So laugh at everyone in line, cross the street, eat, drink, be merry, get your check, go back outside and watch the people that were 'just' in front of you in line STILL wait for a table.",0
"I'll be honest, I should have googled ""how to eat soup dumplings"" before I entered this establishment.  These are really what they say:  Dumplings with soup in them.  With each bite I had it all over me, as well as on the table.  Unfortunately, the table looked like a crime scene when it was all said and done.  When we were leaving, I watched a local eat them, and went ""OHHHHH"".  Do yourself a favor and look it up :).  Also, we ordered crab ones, and they were super fishy.  Wasn't a huge fan.  This place is cash only, and didn't have a super great vibe.  To top it off, there was a lady in the corner staring at us.  Very strange.  There are too many great places in Chinatown, I should have gone elsewhere.",0
"I came here because a friend really loved their soup dumplings.  And while I used to come here quite a bit, I've unfortunately found their quality to have gone down, especially in regards to their soup dumplings. 

PROS:
- good quantity, decent to share but I would definitely get other dishes if you are hungry
- came out hot, so hot the soup could still burn my tongue haha.
- flavor was still pretty good.
CONS:
- fairly thick dough: this to me will cause more of the soup to soak into the dough.  I came for SOUP dumplings.  
- slightly dry, closer to regular dumplings. 

It is much more tourist-oriented than for the locals.  I'm sure the locals go there too.  But the 7000+ reviews definitely have assisted in this. I know I use ratings a lot when I travel.  The one other thing is that I felt rushed and not at ease by the staff, like I was always watched.  Perhaps it was the space as this was right before COVID, but it just doesn't give a good feeling for eating.  

My friend loved it.  But she likes a thick-skin on her dumplings (including her soup dumplings).  I guess this is personal preference.  If you are more of a dough-fan, then these dumplings are for you!",0
"i got food poisoning, and everything was super greasy.  pass.",0
The most I can give is three stars. Crowded and bad services. The xiaolongbao is okay but not super good. Don't go with a high expectation. Oh right. The dishes are more than disppointing.,0
"I went here on the evening the day after my birthday. My father and I walked past here and decided it seemed to be worth a shot due to the critics reviews and Michelin approved status. 
We got the string beans and chicken, Peking duck and the soup dumplings. The Peking duck tastes good and the skin was crispy but it was lacking in flavor. The quantity was also sub par compared to other locations. The soup dumplings I had no complaints. The string beans were also very overpriced. We ended up spending over $80 on the three dishes. It made sense than none of the customers were Asians. This seems to be a place for tourists.",0
"I heard so many good things about this place, and I have to say that I was very disappointed with the xiao long bao. The wrapper was extremely thick- it should be translucent and thin, and the broth was extremely overwhelming. It was too thick and it just had no flavour apart from tasting like animal fat. If you are looking for good xiao long bao, this may not be it. Even though the prices are extremely cheap, you're better off going to a more upscale joint like Din Tai Fung.",0
I'm a little disappointed by this high rated Chinese restaurant. The steamed bao and dumplings were just so so. The spicy fish filet wasn't cooked as the authentic way and tasted not that good. They sell Chinese beer more expensive than other Chinese restaurants in NYC. And the overall experience wasn't nice too - they don't take card and the ATM machine in front of their door charges you for taking cash with any bank. The restaurant looks old and not very clean and people (including their staff) were talking very loud and noisy.,0
"2.5 hr wait time. Definitely not worth it for mediocre Chinese food. Super crowded, the waiter was anxious to get our orders in immediately when we sat down, not having yet looked over the menu. Visiting from the West coast, this place is not worthy of the high praise and long wait time.",0
"The wait isn't too bad. Turn over was fast. The food wasn't as good as I expected it to be specially Xiong long bao; but the beef and scallion, fried rice, and kangkong was better.",0
"My personal mission to try as many soup dumpling places as possible. Another one ticked off the list. A friend and I ordered pork soup dumplings, scallion pancake, baby bok choy and fried pork dumplings. Soup dumplings were good but actually not the best that I've had (and this place is pretty hyped up). Scallion pancake was a little bland and slightly too greasy, baby bok choy was cooked well but the flavors weren't my favorite, had a slightly different aftertaste, fried pork dumplings were again good but not the best I've had. Glad I was able to try this place and would def go back but not the first on my list.",0
I thought the food was alright. If your from California this Chinese food will not cut it. The fried potstickers were good but the shrimp and chicken in sweet sauce and Broccoli chicken were both oily. Like I said maybe this is considered good Chinese food in New York,0
"It's an inexpensive eat and as the Yelp consensus displays below, there is almost always some degree of a wait.  Known for their soup dumplings, it's this combination of cheap eats and tasty hype that keeps the lines sustained to the degree that they are.

We came on a Friday night and waited only about 10 minutes. When you arrive, sidle through the crowd to get inside and look for someone holding a clipboard and a roll of Admit One tickets (really).  They'll give you a number and you can do the standard wait-time estimate request then.

If it's as crowded as it usually is and you have a small party of just a couple of people, you'll be seated at a large table with other couples and trios.  Before you can blink, one server will drop hot tea at your wedge of the table and immediately thereafter, before you can crack the spine on the menu,  the server will stop by for your order and assume that at a minimum, your culinary forecast for the evening includes an order of soup dumplings.

For two people, we had one order of the hyped soup dumplings (they come eight (8) per order), one order of the scallion pancakes, and and an order of turnip pastry buns.   Again, the wait on the food is a function of how busy the rest of the joint is, but not overly noticably long.

The dumplings were tasty, but as other Yelpers have found out, the soup contained therein is scalding hot within the first minute of your food arriving.  Other Yelpers have commented on soup dumpling eating methodology so I won't repeat here, but I""ll just summarize by saying ""Sip and Nibble,  don't Wolf""  (or your throat will have hell to pay).

The scallion pancakes were overly greasy, but still tasty when we kept them paired with the tea to make it taste less oily.  The turnip rolls were tasty as well, but if there's ever a moment to exercise the ""chew your food thoroughly"" clause, this is the time.  You'll have to put your teeth to the resilient turnip shreds inside the rolls.

For this meal, with only the complimentary tea to drink, the meal was less than $15.00, which again harks at the inexpensive list prices which keep the crowds a comin'.  

Service is to-the-point and they can only financially compensate themselves for the cheap prices by turning tables like mad, so don't take offense to the abrupt service.  Eat, enjoy, be on your way and you'll be full and content (and still have a few bills in your wallet) when you leave.",0
"(in my best Seinfeld voice) No soup for you! 

Review just for the soup dumplings. Missing my chance on my last NY trip, I made sure to save room for their famous xiao long bao (soup dumplings) or what they call ""buns"" on the appetizer menu. Xiao long bao are basically dumplings that have soup inside. 

An order of Xiao long bao: 8 big dumplings, comes in crab or pork 
3 locations: 2 in Manhattan and 1 in Queens
Service: super quick and attentive - great operation getting people in and out. 15% automatic gratuity added to your bill. I was seated immediately on a Thursday evening. 

Crab dumplings: the soup is more of a gravy consistency. I didn't feel like there was enough of the soup. The dumplings are very large compared to din tai fung (a famous international xiaolongbao chain). I managed to finish one order by myself but I was kind of pushing it. The filling was alright, nothing too amazing.

What I loved: the vinegar soy sauce that came with it

Bottom line: compared to what I've had at din Tai fung (West Coast), it's kind of lacking and overhyped. But I will be back to try the pork dumplings.",0
"This place is overhyped and overated by Yelpers! I was seriously disappointed by the quality of the Xiao Long Baos. To think that I daydreamed about the food on my 6 hour bus trip from Boston to NYC, I feel this was a let down. Honestly, yelpers, Ding Tai Fung in Asia is wayyy better (they have a branch in Arcadia, Los Angeles too).  

The Xiao long Bao dumplings had very thick skins at Joe's Shanghai, and I felt they were overcooked, so the skin was soggy and the soup broke through the skin very easily. The place was overcrowded at 6pm and we were forced to share a table with 3 other parties, but there was barely any space to place the dishes we ordered on the shared table. We had also waited 40 min for a seat, so the overall dining experience was mediocre.

We also tried the other dishes: braised fish (so oily and sauce was so thick one couldn't even taste the fish), stir fry dou miaos (greens) and red bean dessert (too sweet!) As for the Xiao Long Baos, the crab filling was only slightly tastier than the pork filling ones. 

We paid over $60 for all the dishes, and sadly, as much as we had tried to like the food and place, it just wasn't going to happen. I'll have to rejudge New York Chinese food standards if this is one of the best Xiao Long Bao places in town.",0
"Worse service ever!!! ""Famous"" dumpling just ok. After finishing the last dumpling, they brought the check not even allowing me to decide what else to choose. I defiantly do not recommend.",0
"Yelp published Joe's Shanghai as a dim sum place because someone was uninformed and assumed that this place served dim sum. To clarify, Joe's shanghai is a place for Americanized-shanghainese cuisine and definitely not dim sum. The idea of dim sum is carts with small plates of food being served fresh to the table and what you see is what you get along with tea service. Joe's Shanghai is not any form of dim sum. And my rating for the city location remains at a two-star for food that is always too greasy in comparison to its other locations, as well as, a stuffy environment with table settings and service that don't meet my expectations.",0
"This place was just okay. I admit, the soup dumplings were really good here. But that's about it. Come here for only soup dumplings. Everything else was not worth a second visit.

We ordered the sesame chicken, wondering what made it a popular item on yelps list... Panda Express does it better!!! The sesame chicken seemed like it was fried last night. And then microwaved...

The Peking duck was a disappointment. I saw pictures of it being a Beijing style Peking duck experience. The duck was fine, but they served it with taco sized, mission tortillas!! For the value and wait, I was hoping for something better. I was hoping for thin ""pancakes"" of half the size to make bite sized wraps..

The other foods were okay, but not stuff we would order again.",0
"I ordered the typical tray of the soup pork dumplings, and the crab soup dumplings. Rule of thumb, orders of these pork dumplings usually take 10-15 to come out in a mildly busy atmosphere. These items came up approximately 2-5 minutes in a busy Sunday night. I'm pretty sure these were prepped and waiting to be served 30 minutes to an hour in advance. The dumplings came out somewhere between cold and mildly warm ruining the experience of having it served with the soup hot in the dumpling and skin barely containing the hot pork and soup bursting out of a bite with vinegar. Also ordered a tofu and Chinese spinach soup and young chow fried rice. The soup was strongly flavored with msg and the young chow fried rice was bland using chicken to substitute the red roast pork which is a very important ingredient in this dish. 

There are  plenty of less popular Shanghai restaurants with better quality if you're looking for good Shanghai food in Manhattan Chinatown.",0
"I love Xiao Long Bao. To preface my comments about Joe's, I want to establish my baseline comparison. The current standard for me is a restaurant called Din Tai Fung.  It arguably may not be the best, but it's very good. Now, to be fair, I looked it up, and the mom and pop that started Din Tai Fung aren't actually from Shanghai where XLBs originated from, so I'm not sure if they improved on the original formula, or if theirs is authentic or if Joe's Shanghai's is authentic, or what. But apparently they started off as one mom and pop shop, and now they're all over Asia and parts of the Western US, so I think my tastebuds weren't alone in thinking they were doing something right. I suppose I'll have to drag a Shanghainese friend to both and ask. 

Regardless of what the deal is, I simply find the ones at Joe's to be not very good. While the soup found in DTF's dumplings is delicate, balanced, and delicious, the soup in Joe's is punch-you-in-the face heavy and fatty. To me, it was almost like tonkotsu broth inside. They were also double the size of DTF's dumplings, giving you double-the-already-strong dosage. If you want to feel like a gross whale afterwards, these might be the ticket. 

We did order other dishes besides the dumplings, and those were actually pretty good. But not good enough to battle the crowds.",0
"Came here on a Tuesday for lunch.

The good: Soup dumplings are super yummy and so are their scallions pancakes.

The so so:
Like many restaurants in the area, service is mediocre

The bad:
- Place is really old and not that clean.
- Cell reception is spotty
- They only do cash 
- Can get crowded quite fast.

Final Verdict: If you like dumplings, this is a place you should try at least once...and so I did.. so won't be rushing back.",0
"I was disappointed from beginning to end.  We traveled all the way from Florida to get their famous soup dumplings.  It was my husband first time in NYC and would be his first time trying soup dumpling.  I wanted this experience to be a good one for him since I've had soup dumplings before and from Joe's Shanghai. And it's was great then.  

When we got to the restaurant, the hostess was plenty rude.  We understand there is a long wait and was ok with that.  We place our name on the list and we proceed to sit on the bench that was empty and available inside the restaurant.  I was told to get up and wasn't allow when asked why, the hostess said it's for the people that are ahead of us and they are waiting onside so we would have to wait outside too because it's unfair to those that are here before us.  I didn't understand the concept.  I asked if they knew that these seats were available, she said yes.  Because the people ahead of me chooses to wait outside, why do I have to wait outside especially I was 6 months pregnant and it's hard for me to be on my feet for a long time.  She basically told we had to wait outside while the bench is not being used.  It was plain stupid and unreasonable but did not want to argue any further so we waited outside standing in the hot summer heat.  

We finally got seated after 30 mins.  At this point I was tired, hot, hungry, thirsty and upset so I just want to get our drinks and food.  We ordered two ice waters and the water was warm, they didn't put enough ice so ice were melted by the time it reach our table.  The soup dumplings taste terrible and fishy.  We got the pork and crab dumplings.  Can't even taste the filling inside.  It's was mush and didn't taste right at all.  There were 6-8 dumplings in an order, we couldn't even finish it.  We probably had two each.  We didn't order anything else after that.  Just paid for our bills and left.  Never coming back here again.",0
"Went here because of the great reviews. I ordered cold sesame noodles, they were so bland, no taste at all.
Ordered chicken with broccoli. It was so greasy, I couldn't believe how much grease was in the dish and no taste because all there was , was oil! I just ate the top part, not to ingest all that oil. My friend ordered beef with scallions, it was greasy as well, but not as bad as mine.
Also we had to share a table.
And be careful, the and the tax and tip on the bill, no matter if your one, two or ten people, so don't tip twice!!
No, I won't be going back!",0

The Gist: I came to this place for one thing and one thing only, the soup dumplings. 

After waiting for about half an hour on Sunday afternoon I can honestly say that they did NOT live up to the hype!

One couple at the table I was randomly assigned to waited for their dumplings for about 45 minutes and had to order two other dishes to hold them over while they waited. 

While the pork dumplings were certainly better to than the pork/crab combination I can honestly say that this is a great concept with a par at best execution.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is quite overrated.
I don't understand what all the hype with Joe's is about.  The wait here is really long, it's touristy, and the XLB's (xiaolong bao / xiulong bao / Shanghainese soup dumplings / shoulonpou) here are not amazing.  Sure, they come out piping hot, but I like the ones at Petite Soochow (Ridgefield Park, NJ) just across the river a lot better.  Yes, I understand that not everyone would want to travel that far.
 
I didn't particularly like the Joe's in Flushing either.",0
I think this place is seriously hyped. The soup dumpling isn't so bad. but the rest of the menu is atrocious! Really bad. I had bad taste in my mouth all day long.. I will not go back there again. I prefer the Taiwanese Chinese restaurants in Queens- cleaner more tasteful.,0
"Joe's Shanghai is overrated and not worth your time. Yes, it is very famous and everyone hears about it, but really you can have better Chinese food elsewhere in Chinatown minus the wait. 
Like most people who ended up in Joe's Shanghai, I heard raving reviews from friends and family, so I decided to try it. 
Came at lunch time on Monday so almost no wait with just the two of us. We placed the order of soup dumplings and at the same time, two tables were also seated. We waited for 20 minutes for the dumplings to come while the people at the two tables were having their second servings of soup dumplings. Service leaves something else to be desired as we were neglected while they served other people.

Finally soup dumplings came and they were at best medicore/OK. There is soup that comes out of the dumpling when you bite it, but other than that, it tastes like plain dumplings. Not worth your time. Go somewhere else for better Chinese food WITHOUT the wait. I won't be coming back at all.",0
"I had heard so many things about this place, but I went I was pretty disappointed.  Even without the hype, I don't think I would have been that impressed.  (I'm rating the  When it comes to siu lung baos IN the US, there are better places such as Din Tai Fung. (even though those have a Taiwanese spin)  There is even a better place in New York (I'll have to dig up the name of the restaurant).   

If you do go, stick with the pork dumplings.  The seafood one was not good.  In any case, this place does not live up to the hype.",0
"Arguably the worst service and attitude of any place I've ever been. Visiting from out of town and this is usually one of our stops. But after eating there Saturday afternoon my wife and I both said WHY do we come back ? We'll never be back. The food is mediocre at best ! And the service is atrocious.  It's hurry up eat and get the FUCK out is there mentality. And it's cash only, can u say we're screwing the IRS ! Do yourself a favor and try some other place we definitely will on our next visit to NY.",0
"Was expecting better since they put the word ""Shanghai"" onto their restaurant name. For a Shanghainese who had countless authentic soup dumplings in SH, the ones served in Joe's Shanghai is very very mediocre. Their pork and crab filling does taste more fresh than your other options in Chinatown. However, the size of the soup dumpling was what had me shook. One equals two of those in Shanghai! They are way too big. The pleating was not done nicely either. The worst part was the skin. Their skin were way too thick and unenjoyable to chew on. I tried their other auth Chinese food as well. Either was too oily or had loads of MSG added. The restaurant makes you sit with complete strangers. Ppl from my neighboring seats ordered Americanized Chinese food like ""genera Tao chicken"" and ""mangolia beef"". Maybe that's a better choice.",0
"I had this place bookmarked since it had so many great reviews, but sad to report I feel it is a bit of a tourist trap.

XLB: 2/5. Massive in size, but the shell was thick and the soup was very fatty and got sickening quick. Maybe I'm just used to Din Tai Fung's lighter broth and smaller XLBs, but we were only able to finish a couple.

Szechuan beef noodle soup: 3/5. A light broth, chewy noodles. Taste was good but nothing special.

If you're just visiting, I would skip.",0
"Famous place but other than that, I've had better or at least similar soup dumplings from other places for cheaper, and better environment and service! Most Chinese places (less modern ones) in Chinatown don't do  tips. And the food is cheaper too! But if you are looking to say you went to Joes then yes I totally understand. But if your in the mood for great soup dumplings and cheapest, then go somewhere else. If you do go here, pork soup dumplings is the best. Crab one was fishy.",0
"I use to love this place because it was such a tourist destination. It's been years since I've been here and the service still sucks. For sure I'm not here for their service. I'm here for the famous xiao long bao...so good! Since my family came to visit we decided to go to Joe, the famous xiao long bao is not as good as it use to!! I'm sure in NYC there are plenty of awesome hole in the wall places. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place. But of course they have set their name as a tourist attraction place. ""Must go!"" There service is still awesomely suck!!! What restaurant have a service charge of 15% for just three people?!? If we didn't look carefully to that we would of double tip them a suck ass service. NOW THAT IS SOMETHING I DONT CARE FOR RESTAURANT TO DO! Service charge should be included if the party if greater than 6 people.",0
"It's Christmas, and yes I know the expectation is a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour wait.

But we were the lucky ones that were able to get a table within 2 minutes of entering.  And while all the filled tables around us starting getting their food, I was still in the Christmas spirit and refused to believe that we were the only ones forgotten.

And as I started typing this and we finally received our food, I altered my initial one star review to a solid three stars:  the food here, while I have had better, was good.  The owner even came out to greet us personally.  This I like!!!!

We had the standard broccoli beef, combo pan fried noodles (fan of the thin crispy noodles so not a favorite for me), fried pork (very tasty and not greasy), and of course their famous soup dumplings, which were flavorful and tender.

All in all, a solid three New York experience.",0
Famous for their dumplings however only 2 kinds served. Bad service as well. Left without ordering.,0
"Items Selected:
Pork Steam Buns
Fried Pork Dumplings
Kung Pao Chicken 
Pan Fried Noodles with Beef

Originally located in Flushing, the Soup Dumplings such a sensation that locations in Chinatown and Midtown soon followed, Joe's Shanghai is as close to an institution as anything in the Five Boroughs, accolades from the Times, Zagat and several international publications turning each walk-in-only Restaurant into the sort of place both locals and tourists are willing to line up for.

Originally founded in 1995, though the praise and décor would make many assume the restaurant that has since expanded to Japan is far older, it was around 2pm on a Saturday that a party of three approached Joe's at 9 Pell Street, the low-ceilinged space completely full with persons of all ages, colors and ethnicities, one of the six-person communal rounds soon to partially open up after a mere ten minutes of standing at the door.

Owned by Mei Ping Matsumura and ""Joe"" Si, the somewhat Americanized Chinese menu taking its roots in the food of Hong Kong but spreading across hundreds of items including a few, like the sweet Congee, that servers will frankly tell patrons *not* to order, it is with Hot Tea (that is also used to wipe down tabletops) already present that diners are handed menus, Tap Water refilled intermittently on request with a few additional Sodas and softdrinks also available.

Mostly English friendly, a necessity thankfully recognized by ownership as no effort has been made to detail dishes on the menu - the famous xiaolongbao still listed as ""Pork Steam Buns"" even though almost everyone calls the Soup Dumplings either that or XLB, it is essentially as if servers already have ""1"" or ""2"" written down as they seat patrons, the former $8.25 and stuffed with Pork plus Crab while the $6.25 version eschews the Crustacean and comes across with a smooth, briny smack thanks to the cloudy Aspic with a surprising amount of shredded Meat mixed in it.

Flooding the table with condiments, chopsticks, small cups and eventually food, those ordering past the Dumplings are offered a bevy of options including whole Ducks, various Seafoods and Noodle dishes, the Fried Pork Dumplings taking a wrapper similar in thickness to those of the Soup Dumplings and placing it around ground Sausage with just a bit of spice and serving it with Ginger-infused Soy for dipping.

Hoping that a place of such regard would have mastered Kung Pao Chicken, though the Sichuan origin of that dish probably should have raised some second thoughts at a place with Shanghai above its door since the areas are over thirteen hundred miles apart, Joe's version comes with a lot of oil and not much spice, the Vegetables completely eschewed with extra Peanuts filling in alongside the generous plate of cubed slightly overcooked Breast Meat.

Doing better by the Pan Fried Noodles, a Shanghai standard that here sees thick, flour lengths first broken and then cooked springy in Dark and Light Soy Sauce plus a bit of Sugar, Joe's Beef is sliced thin and added to the pan late which makes for a unique taste with some bites briny and others meaty, the sautéed Spinach standing in for Bok Choy another odd choice leads to an earthy finish, rather than the more typical bitter.",0
"This place is really hyped up, but honestly, I've had MUCH better ""hood Chinese food"" lol. Just saying. 

I had this place bookmarked for a few years. So when I found myself in chinatown one day and hungry, I decided why not finally try it? The crab/pork soup dumplings are good but it's not like ""OMG I have to come back"" good. They were just regular good lol. We should've stopped there. For the meal, we had general tso's shrimp and it had no flavor, no spice, vegetables barely cooked, shrimp overcooked, the rice wasn't even good. I could've gotten some bomb general tso's for $7 from the local Chinese food restaurant. Not to mention the really bad service and the place is filthy. Maybe the traditional Chinese food is good here? Idk, I tried to like this one but I will never go back.",0
"Don't be fooled by all the reviews, the meal and the atmosphere was awful. When you go in they simply jam you into any seats that are available with other people. The staff is completely indifferent and only or in a hurry feeder order so you can get up and get out. Don't think that you're going to Chinatown for something special  or home flavor, this place is really bad.",0
Okay these are my first time trying soup dumplings... I think? But whats the hype about this place?  We waited about 20 mins and then got sat down with another family.  I guess thats pretty smart of the restaurant to turn around tables quick.  But the dumplings itself were not that amazing... Some parts of the dumpling seemed super dry while some were nice and tender... do order the pork meat dumplings over the crab meat ones.  the crab meat ones were even more greasy and had a funky after taste. I do admit though you can get two rounds of dumplings for less than 20 bucks if I remember correctly.,0
"The archetypal Lonely Planet tourist trap. Prepare to share tables, deal with missed orders and dirty tables. To be fair, the service tries hard given the chaos.

""Kao Fu"" -- the traditional Shanghainese beancurd appetizer (not sure what it is on the menu). Came in huge, crude chunks, overly chilled, which spoiled the entire dish. Zero marks for presentation, and I'm comparing it to plebeian street versions.

Crab/Pork dumplings -- Taste-wise was fair with a good amount of stock in each bun, but the skin was overly thick. Alternately saggy, soggy and tough in all the wrong places. Perhaps it's a lack of viable competitors that garner Joe's the accolades they have, but in comparison to the xiao long bao stalwarts worldwide (read: Nan Xiang Xiaolongbao and Din Tai Fung), this is a poor imitation of the real thing.

Shredded Turnip Shortcake -- Pretty tasty and fresh. No complaints except that some sections were bitter (hard to avoid with turnips)

String Bean Szechuan Style -- Hard to screw this one up, still far from noteworthy

Shanghai Fried Noodles (thick) -- this is called ""udon"" by the staff, and was a disgrace to this Shanghainese street classic. The noodles did resemble bland udon rather than the earthy handmade noodles typically used. Seasoning fell short, just a mix of oil and soy sauce without the right zing. Parts were burnt, not in a good way (i.e. not ""wok hei""), making the entire dish taste charred.


I might be the contrarian here but Joe's Shanghai is nowhere near the authentic experience promised in tourist guidebooks. The restaurant really seems to excel at Western-friendly Chinese take-out style stuff like the double pan fried noodles with beef everyone seems to order. Never again, unless taking a tourist friend there ""for the experience"". Thank god for Chinatown Ice Cream Factory round the corner.",0
"That says it all. Meh, I've experienced better, far better and the wait on Christmas day was ridiculous. Our party of 7 waited for over an hour and 40 minutes to get into this typical Chinatown restaurant. Certainly, Joe the owner was directing traffic and admitted to me that this day was the busiest of the year for him. However the food, service (which was good for the typical Chinatown restaurant but no better than just acceptable), ambiance (none), setting (same ol chairs, tables, abused carpeting, barely passable bathrooms, etc...) and however else you gauge a restaurant, but why should this restaurant have a line that stretched past 5pm into the night when a similarly sized Chinese food restaurant across the street was only 3/4 full (Famous Sichuan) with no waiting line? Sure the restaurant grade of ""B"" might have something to do with that, but just because Joe's has an ""A"" doesn't really mean squat in lettered cleanliness? I saw the kitchen, believe me, I could find 100 kitchen issues in 5 minutes. 

All that being said, I am not giving Joe's a poor grade because of the stupid line-up. We chose to wait because so many people said it was the best. One fellow was waiting for a single seat for the same amount of time. So do people just want to say they waited? Have fun with the people in the crush? Our group made the most of it, but by the time we did get in, they had no available Won Ton soup and a couple of other items. What we did order was indeed meh... Shanghai noodles (just ok, good noodles, too much oil, vegetables just fine, no flavor, just the typical overly Unctuous oil flavor. Beef and broccoli, same thing, limited flavor, just crunchy vegetables and too much oil. Genreal tso chicken, not too much heat, also too greasy, nothing special, Shanghai dumplings, some turmeric flavor, sticky bun and plenty of water inside. Not a great version of a steamed dumpling and oh, by the way, no dim sum really beyond that. 

We also had an udon noodle soup with chicken and spinach which was not better than average. I've had far better noodle soup at deli's on 8th ave and 35th in midtown for half the price. Additionally a sweet and sour soup to share for two, also loaded with thickening agent and limited in flavor as well as the egg drop soup. Thickening agent galore. 

Also, the rice, was just rice. Frankly, if I wait for over an hour and a half, I expect perfection or close to it. There are 100 restaurants in NY's China town that would do the same or better with similar cleanliness, kitchen, indifferent staff without the wait. Frankly, having cooked Chinese meals as well as having eaten hundreds or more over the years in different cities and countries, Joe's of Shanghai will not be visited by me or anyone I know simply because it isn't worth the wait, certainly not for the food. 

I will try the ""B"" rated restaurant ""Famous Sichuan"" across the street just to compare Joe's of Shanghai and it's one hour and 40 minute wait. I suspect it will be just as good or better, rat dropping, cockroaches or other contravention or not. I mean really, is Joe's of Shanghai so much cleaner, or higher quality? I doubt it. 

So come on people, don't follow the hoards. Make-up your own minds and know that most restaurants in China Town are similar, not one standing out for food quality, preparation, service (one plate was actually just dropped on the table in front of one of my guests), ambiance, etc... Especially Joe's. Nice fellow. He has a gold mine, but really, don't waste your time.",0
"Beware. This is not the same beloved restaurant that was on Pell St.  Must have sold their name. Despite an attempt to keep things the same on the surface the food is quite different. Dumplings have completely different taste. Barely taste the crab. It's kind of bland. Food in general is is too sweet and over salted. Not bad -- just nothing special, passable NY Chinese food. Table set up changed (no tea pot, no jar of fresh chilli paste) Menu morphed. Vegetarian dumpling now available. Fried! Sacrilege. We were very disappointed. Felt like tourists. We had been eating at the original for 10 years.

Is this a scam? Is it dishonest? Whatever. The food is not the same.",0
"Don't believe the hype. Native New Yorker here. The place used to be great until it got over hyped and they started generating for revenue. After that it's gone down hill. My most recent visit has lost me as a customer forever unless they can make some serious changes.

So here's what happened,
Three people gave us an estimated wait time of 20 minutes. That was fine since the place was full. Ten minutes later they tell us our table is ready. We go inside and then the maitre d' tells us another few minutes because the other maitre d' gave the table away to a group of three that came after us. We were a little annoyed but fine we'll wait the extra minutes. Long story short, half an hour later were still standing and waiting. People who've just came in and asked for a table were seated before us. When we asked about it they gave us attitude saying they were popular and people needed to wait. Needless to say, they were rude and arrogant.
The soup dumplings (Xiao Long bao) is still decent but quality has definitely lowered to just to keep up with demand. In my opinion they should be able to do both if really wanted.
The staff need a serious attitude adjustment though.",0
Meh. I don't really like the food. It's not one of the cleanest spots I have been either. Would recommend for someone wants a china town experience,0
"the soup dumplings are really good here

but I wouldn't really recommend the noodle/rice dishes here... very bland",0
"Dear Joes Shanghai,
You just lost a loyal customer today. You have been my favorite for over 10 years. I took my family, who's never been to NY, to visit and highly recommended you. However, today's experience-  I'm highly disappointed and will never come back. Your server, who brought out the wrong food, yelled at us. Your ""Diced pork & Dry bean curd"" dish was mainly made of chicken. When pointed out, you claimed a string of pork ear was ""pork"", and that was the only pork ingredient in your diced pork dish. Although the food was incorrect, the servers attitude was the most upsetting, being yelled loudly by your server. 
We won't be coming back, but as well-known as you are. I'd recommend you retrain your server so other guests won't have to experience that we went through.",0
"Terrible digs, sub-par and overpriced XLB, and lackluster dishes. The fried flounder is the only seriously tasty thing I've had here. I'd rather get a foot massage across the street and then go Shanghai Cafe deluxe, 456, or flushing.",0
"Don't understand the hype. West coast XLB, or dim sum palace in Manhattan is a lot better than this place. Broth tastes dirty and dumplings are too big.",0
"Not sure how difficult it is to find soup dumplings in the city, but I felt that this place was a bit overhyped. The soup dumplings with crab meat were pretty good, but the plain pork ones were very average and didn't have enough soup in them. I tried a few other veggie/meat dishes as well, which all tasted just mediocre.

The restaurant itself just seemed too noisy and crowded, but service was still prompt. Fortunately, all the food came out within a reasonable span of time. I just wish the quality were better.",0
Overrated and not very delicious sadly. It's more for the tourists than the locals who want good food. Service is excellent as is the ambiance but the food has really gone downhill.,0
"As Californians, we were spoiled with xiao long bao from Din Tai Fung. We had high expectations coming to Joe's Shanghai, but unfortunately, the soup dumplings didn't meet our expectations. The vinegar sauce also was not as flavorful. The green onion pancake was more appetizing. I would give the onion pancake an 11/10. The crispiness was on point and the sauce doe the pancake was savory - hint of sweet and salty.",0
"Three stars.

Pretty good soup dumplings. Very fattening, but sometimes you need that, especially on a cold winter night.

Tip: If you go with a large party, you might end up waiting hours outside to get seated together. If your party don't mind splitting up in 2s or 3s, you get seated much quicker.

Last time I was here, this place was rated B for their sanitary inspection. Not sure if this is true, but the restaurant within the same block under a different name is under the same management, with the inspection grade of A and no waiting lines. I'll update this review when I visit next time and find out more info. Till then, happy slurping!",0
"I was recently in NYC for a sporting event and visited Joe's Shanghai based off of the recommendations from a couple of friends.  Obviously I went with the XLB since that's what they're famous for.  I also ordered a peking duck.  The XLB was ok, not the best I've ever had but definitely hits the spot when you have a craving for soup dumpings.  The duck on the other hand was pretty magnificent.  The skin was perfectly crispy and the duck was tender and moist.  Only reason this review wasn't a 4 star is because the price of the food there was pretty inflated, but I guess that's what you would expect in NYC.  I do have to say though, there are plenty of great whole in the wall type of restaurants in the city that wont break the bank.",0
"I am a XiaoLongBao - Soup Dumplings Connoisseur.
I've had XLB from Cali to China to NYC and this place is one of the worst I've had ever. 
Skin - was so thin it was falling apart and not only couldn't hold the soup but could barely hold the meat.
Soup - was loaded with so much pepper it make it taste almost spicy but not a good spicy.
Meat - is on the same boat as the soup. I don't see how they can disregard how much pepper they are loading in there. It's like eating something and pouring a bottle of pepper in your mouth between each bite.
Atmosphere - on top of that, they only take cash (which didn't affect me). They charge a gratuity on anyone regardless of how big is your party (which doesn't affect me if they would do their job and serve). Have you ever had. Group of guys joking and staring at you while you eat? It's pretty uncomfortable.
Most XLB places hire females or a mixture, but they only wanted guys and for that they probably have people that don't want to tip them and they resort to charging it.
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against them charging a gratuity since it was stated. The problem I have is if you're going to charge one then actually do your job instead of standing there and messing around.
P.S. This is my personal opinion but look and compare the reviews for the places around NYC.
I will give any place a second chance but I just don't see myself ever liking this place. It lacks in every aspect of XLB with no positives at all. 
Also they leave their Black vinegar dip outside sitting on the table which is gross. I hope they change it between customers but regardless it's not sanitary to just leave it sitting there. At least have the decency to bring it from the back whether it's clean of not; at least I won't see it.
Do yourself a favor and go to any of the hundred ones around there.",0
"If you are only ordering xiao long bao and don't care about your time or comfort, this place rates higher than my review. In all honesty the xiao long bao are 4 stars, almost as good as Ding Tai Fung in Hong Kong. However the rest of their menu is 3 stars at best. Avoid the duck and most cold cuts, nor is much of the seafood any good for a Shanghainese place. Expect to wait in a stench filled street filled with garbage if you go in the evening. Also expect very rude service, in fact this is the first restaurant I am rating down for their horrible wait staff. Thus this review would normally be 3 stars for their overall choices of food.",0
"I've heard great things about this place until I experienced it for myself.  I went with friends for lunch and the service was HORRIBLE.  The pork buns on the menu were not what we expected, and once the was just dropped off at the table with not know what some of the entrees were.  We had to ask numerous times for refills on water. We were constantly ignored by the wait staff.  I will NEVER be returning here and I encourage others to do the same.",0
"We showed up to this place pretty late on the night we arrived and the line was stretched out down the block. We found the hostess and got our name on the list before heading to the bar next door for drinks as we waited. Once inside we the place was truly raucous and loud, but everyone - from all walks - was clearly having the time of their lives. 

The environment was fantastic but we got approached by two different waiters for our orders and they ended up bringing us a dish we didn't actually ask for. Additionally, once we got all our food (which was way too much for the tiny top we were seated at) it was overall fine, but honestly a bit bland for what we were hoping for. In my personal opinion the place is fun as an environment but a bit overhyped so far as the actual food is concerned. 

Go here fam, but no rush to do so.",0
"I came here and didn't have to wait at all. We were seated at the same table as another party (which was fine, I did this in China as well) and I was really excited to try the dumplings/dim sum.

This place was super packed and the waiters had a mentality ""eat and get the hell outta here"". So I felt like I was in an eating contest with my food. Literally the waiters were running around like they were in an olympic race. It gave me a bit of anxiety. 

We ordered a bunch of food: noodle dishes, dim sum, dumplings, etc. hoping that everything would be the best Chinese food we've ever had.

Sadly, I wasn't really impressed with any of the dishes. I thought the flavors were quite bland and nothing special. I'm not sure what all the hype is about but there are a lot better places for dim sum and Chinese dishes. It's mainly tourists here which is understandable but it's not worth the wait or hype.

Maybe I'll come back and try it again to see if I'm missing something, but for right now, not impressed!",0
"A complete tourist trap in Chinatown.  Would definitely never go to again.  

To start off I found the staff to be rather pushy and not hospitable at all.  Instead of feeling welcome here, I felt like my group was being rushed in and out as soon as possible.  

Next, the food is completely lackluster and just doesn't taste that good.  

I had the tofu, shrimp, and diced pork.  It was supposed to be spicy --- it wasn't in any way, shape, or form.   Instead it was completely bland and boring.... and for some reason it had peas in it.   I really don't understand that.

The signature dish here is the soup filled dumplings ... these are ok ... but I can't imagine any reason to justify sitting outside in a line waiting to get inside to have some.  At the end of the day, I would rather just have a normal bowl of Chinese soup with dumplings on the side.  You can find soup and good dumplings at a million other restaurants in chinatown.  Having the broth inside the dumpling loses its allure rather quickly. 

Finally - they don't take credit cards and they automatically add the tip into your bill.  Neither scenario are ones that I appreciate.  Keep both in mind please when ordering.

If you want really good Chinese food, I would highly recommend walking around the corner from here and checking out the Hop Shing located at 9 Chatham Square.   There you will find real Chinese food --- the way the Chinese like it.  (For what its worth -- the majority of people at Joe's Shanghai were not Chinese -- the majority at Hop Shing always are -- that should tell you something)

Waiting to get into this Joe's Shanghai just makes no sense to me.  I will not be back.",0
"I don't get it, this place was terrible. The chicken was old, dry, and undercooked (pink). The soup dumplings were way too soupy to even pick up. Half of the dumplings were already punctured when they reached he table.
The service was questionable even for Chinatown. In my option Joes Ginger is the better option for Shanghainese",0
"Was in the mood for some dumplings and Yelp lead us here. 
We ordered the soup dumplings and the pan fried dumplings. Pork and seafood. Some of the dumpling wrappers were thinner than others. Because of that, the soup dumplings fell apart and some were leaking broth as we picked it up off the basket. The dumplings itself were bland to me. It needed some more seasoning. The seafood dumplings were fishy. We could definitely tell they were seafood from the after taste. The pan fried dumplings was nothing different from your regular Chinese take out. Not the worst dumplings but definitely not worth a second visit. Don't think we'll be back. Headed back to Yelp for another dumpling place.",0
This place is a way too expensive. One beef broccoli costs 17.00 + tax.  The rice is not free. In general the rice is free for restaurants.  This place is bullshit.  The only good dish is soup dumplings.  Not recommended!,0
"Real authentic Chinese place, food is good and on point!
Quick service, had to ask for fork n knives! Long noodles, im guessing in house made...",0
"I am not normally one to give soup dumplings anything but 5-Stars, but when we went, even though we devoured hundreds of dumplings (pork, crab) they seemed a bit overly mass produced.  Almost immediately after arriving at the table they got too sticky, thus spilling out everywhere when you tried to remove them from the baskets, and the soup tasted too gelatinous.  The flavors were good, and the rest of the food was good, but I just wasn't overwhelmed.

+1 Star for when they came to sing our friend Happy Birthday one of the waiters wishes he were an opera star and probably could be with the set of lungs he has.  It was quite memorable.",0
"As soon as I walked in and saw that we were the only asians should've been a warning.  Ordered the pan fried shanghai thick noodles, onion pancakes, and their ""infamous"" shanghai dumplings.  Searched through their whole menu and sadly this place doesn't even have soybean drink.  The onion pancakes came, super greasy.  The noodles came, super greasy, and taste like burnt wok.  The dumplings came, and they were unruly in size.  The soup was absolutely disgusting!!! Can't even call it soup, it was ALL oil, and it tasted funny.  Not to mention, there's SOOO many waiters here that are just hawking at you.  Ugh so uncomfortable.
Worse part of my NY trip, can't believe I wasted my time and money coming here.  total FML.     

Conclusion: Tourist trap, over-hyped, frozen shanghai dumplings taste better than this, health hazard if you eat these 

FMLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL",0
"The definition of overrated. I knew something was off when I arrived at the location and the staff told me and my friend 20 minute wait. We walked away for four minutes than all of a sudden our table was ready when nobody left. Very fishy, almost like they said that to dissuade us to not dine here. The soup dumplings were at a inflated price because Joe makes a killing on tourists or people that never had Shanghai food. None of the dishes that were soup dumplings would stand a chance to be sold by themselves. Insider Food did an interview with Joe and he said that his soup dumplings have 30 pleats good and on average chefs have 26 pleats. Well it's clear Joe doesn't work in the Chinatown one because there was 22 pleats when I went. The best surprise of the whole experience is when they charged me for 2 whole orders of crab meat soup dumplings when I ordered one pork, and one order of half pork / crab meat. Pork was $12.95 and Crab is about 3 dollars more but do what you gotta do to keep the lights on I guess. There are local places all throughout Nyc that won't charge an arm for soup dumplings and have better quality.",0
"Good dumplings but is the worst service ever... I would not come back... The food came late, forgot the order... the waiters are clueless",0
"These infamous Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are definitely one of the best, if not the best, in the city. Believe the raving loyalists, the newspaper reviews plastered all over the walls, and everything else. The dumplings are everything you want them to be- fresh, piping hot, and perfect inside and outside. Served with vinegar and fresh ginger. They deserve 4-5 stars alone. However, the rest of the food here is kind of abysmal. The only other thing I'd order besides the bao is maybe Chinese water spinach which is decent although really oily. Also, while I do love the crab and pork versions of the soup dumplings, there always seems to be crab shell fragments in at least a few pieces per steamer. If you're into crab shell Russian roulette then this is the perfect entree.",0
"Came in for the crab and pork soup dumplings because we'd heard that they were the best in the world. I'm not sure you can call these xlbs but they were rather soupy and decent. Definitely not even close to top 10 best dumplings I've ever had.  I thought the skin was too thick and overall the way this entire establishment is run is pretty unappealing. Rude service, rushing people out, pushing past customers in the narrow walkways with plates of food... meh.",0
Came with my family and ordered a bunch of food. Things were good until I got a piece of metal in the first crab soup dumpling I bit into.,0
"Eh, really wasn't that great.  Soup dumplings were great (also my first experience) but the other dishes were nothing to write home about.  It you want to gorge on Chinese food and spend about $10, this is your spot.",0
Really unimpressed. Dumplings were fine. Fried rice was tasted like smoke. Kung pao chicken wasn't the least bit spicy and had zero flavor. Would not come back. Definitely feel like we got sucked into a tourist attraction.,0
"I'm sorry but Joe's Shanghai is completely overrated! Everytime I've tried to come here there has been such a long line that I decided to pass.  This time I was in Chinatown on a Saturday with friends and figured we'd give it a try and we got lucky - walked right in.....

Now one thing that I guess is cool about this place is that they sit you where there is an opening - so you will sit at a table with random people. One very important thing you will notice when you enter Joe's Shanghai is the lack of actual Chinese people eating here - I think that's a clear sign about the food here!! The decor was the same, it really felt like being in a cheap chinese american restaurant. 

For food we ordered Pork buns (Soup Dumplings), which are priced well - 8 for around $5, beef w/ Broccoli, sauteed bok choy, scallion pancake, and chicken and vermicelli. Really, the soup dumplings weren't anything special - there wasn't much soup in the dumplings and they weren't that flavorful - They were just ok, but since I've had really good soup dumplings in Shanghai and comparably good dumplings at Nan Xiang in Flushing (http://www.yelp.com/biz/nan-xiang-dumpling-house-flushing) i know what really good dumplings should be like.  The rest of the food isn't worth going into much detail - and really made for the American palette. I will add that the scallion pancake was super greasy!! Try the Scallion Pancakes at Nan Xiang if you want try to try a good one.

This place is a waste of time if you have to wait on that long line - the food isn't great, the ambience isn't the best - and really this place is so overrated - plus there are so many other good AUTHENTIC chinese food restaurants in the area.",0
"Uhhh I dont know why people RAVE about this place. I have certainly have had better. Maybe I am a Cali snob and am missing the delicious chinese cuisine in the Bay Area. Maybe since I have been eating chinese food all my life, every chinese place is just meh to me. Maybe I am right and this place is a little overrated. *shrug

The dumplings are good, but not good enough for me to wait and share the table with 5 other parties of 2. 

If you absolutely have to have their soup dumplings and dont believe me that they are just OK.... go next door to Joe's Ginger (i think thats what its called). They are owned by the same people and you get to cut down on the wait time.",0
"Soup dumplings are great, but the mandatory 15% tip + tax ""for my convenience"" is a little telling. I still like shanghai cafe better because they have bubble tea.",0
"the xlb's at joe's are okay.  i am not really a fan of joe's because it's so americanized.   i usually judge a chinese restaurant by how many non-asian people frequent it.   i'm not saying the food isn't good at joe's and i am not saying it's bad that there are more non-asian people in line for it than asian people.   asian places with a lot of non-asian customers usually charge more for their food and usually charge tax.   a typical chinese place in chinatown does not charge tax and the prices are usually lower and i feel their food is inferior because they americanize it somehow.

joe's prices are more money and they charge tax.   i don't think the xlb's at joe's warrant such a long wait when there are better shanghainese places to get your xlb fix.   because the lines are so long at joe's, the waiters end up rushing you and it is so cramped inside.   if i am going to eat xlb, i want to be able to eat it without waiting forever for a table and without being kicked out shortly after sitting down.

on another note, i do order joe's via seamless when i order dinner at work, but i only order it because it's on the firm and i don't have to wait too long for it.

if you want good xlb, try the shanghai place across the street from the police precinct on elizabeth street. now that's a good mom & pop's shanghai place.   (avoid 456 shanghai - that's another tourist trap.  shanghai cafe/shanghai manor are good contenders).",0
"The dishes were good, but their customer service was the worse I've even seen. Their staff were rude to us, and they were saying something in our back in Chinese. Overall, it was a not very good experience, a little bit disappointing because we were very excited about it. And the staff ruined everything.",0
"i hate to go against the grain here, esp since majority of the 800+ reviews for Joe's Shanghai seem to be glowing.

moved near Chinatown, and found Joe's off yelp.

got the infamous #1 - pork/crab buns (aka: soup dumplings).

delicious, but wasn't BLOWN AWAY like everyone else seems to be.
maybe there is a slight bias there, since chinese cuisine isn't my #1.
also, this was my first Xiao Long Bao experience, so I also didn't have anything to compare it to.

all in all, i would recommend.",0
"This place is completely overrated. Two of us had to wait over 15 minutes to be seated at a table for eight--with three other parties. 

Tried two types of soup dumplings, both of which were bland and terrible. The one that supposedly had crab in it was especially poor, as I apparently paid extra for little strings of seafood that didn't taste like anything. The skins didn't complement the dumplings at all and were simultaneously too thick yet broke when picked up with chopsticks.

We also had the cut noodles, which have long been a favorite dish of mine. The ones here were excessively doughy, and yep, flavorless. The accompanying meat was over-tenderized. Service and decor were typical Chinatown, which is fine with me. 

I'm probably spoiled from growing up in the SF Bay Area, but this place was terrible even by NY Chinese food standards, and I most certainly won't be back.

Tip: Try Amazing 66. It's not Shanghainese cuisine, but at least it's tasty.",0
"Can't be comparable to real soup dumplings from
Din tai fung. Also really disliked their noodles. Furthermore, we went right when they closed and they seated us. But then said they only had soup dumplings and noodles. Which is quite limited, I wish they just turned us away",0
"We were staying at the Hotel 50 Bowery next doors which had a partnership with Joe's and allowed us to order $50 worth of takeout each day we stayed there so we tried Joe's twice during our stay. I couldn't understand what the hype was about. The soup dumplings wrappers were much too thick and taste itself was below par. I've had much better elsewhere (Din Tai Fung for example). 

Other things we tried were just meh as well. The Szechuan Spicy Beef Noodle soup had a weird taste and the wonton soup felt really basic. I won't be dining in anytime soon.",0
I didn't like it here. I'm not a fan of communal seating and in a place where everyone orders quite a few different things it felt cramped and awkward. The soup dumplings were fantastic. The rest looked and tasted like very poor quality Chinese food. Hugely disappointed.,0
"Well, I tried their small steamed bun in flushing before & it was awesome . However,the food here tasted more slaty & the price is little bit higher than flushing. I felt disappointed . Even though they are the same name of the restaurants, the chefs are different。I don't recommend ppl come here but suggest to go to  the one in Flushing. It's better",0
"Soup dumplings remain exceptional...but service has deteriorated from casual to downright sloppy and inattentive.  When we finally received the food we actually ordered, we found the quality poor.  Joe's is no longer the special destination we looked forward to.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is my least favorite Shanghainese place. It's hype doesn't help either. It attracts a lot of tourists, and a lot of people who do not know what is GOOD Shanghainese cuisine. 

My father lived in Shanghai for many years for business purposes, and he is also not a fan. The soup dumplings are not soupy, and the dough are too thick. Why do the dumplings break even with such a thick dough btw? 

I highly suggest for people to spend a few more minutes on yelp, or tripadvisor and potentially look for a better restaurant to try minus the hype.",0
"My friends and I got there right before the Friday night wave so we got seated within 5 minutes. It's cash only but they have an ATM right outside.

Ordered beef noodle soup, Shanghai stir-fry udon, original and crab-meat soup dumplings, and kungpao chicken. The beef in the noodle soup wasn't spectacular and I've had better Shanghai stir-fry udon elsewhere.

The only pro is their soup dumplings. I've never had soup dumplings this size in NYC and they were filled with yummy soup. If you go here, definitely try the soup dumplings to spend your money wisely",0
"Food is good at the restaurant but we had an awful experience ordering food to be delivered today. They use postmates which was a complete disappointment and awful experience. The food was waiting to be picked up for delivery and postmates cancelled last minute leaving me stranded to pick up a large order for a group lunch. All they send is an email when it's too late to make other arrangements, it's horrible customer service and they cannot be trusted to deliver food.  The restaurant should provide a reliable delivery service  that works.",0
"This new location has a nice interior but the food is overhyped. The crab meat soup dumplings are nothing to write home about (somewhat bland) and the shanghai stir fry noodles are too salty. I did like the scallion pancakes (good ratio of fluffiness to crispiness) and the red bean dessert pastry. 

The food was overall pretty decent but for me, not worth an insanely long wait for some very average soup dumplings. That's what we came for!",0
"This place was just OK to me. The price point for the food is fine but I did not see the hype for it. Service was fine and they seemed like they were always in a rush, which was understandable given how busy it was. We would have to try to flag them down if we needed anything. We ordered soup dumplings, scallion pancake, and the Shanghai noodle soup. The soup dumplings were not that great to me. It was hard and doughy on the top while being dry. Other soup dumplings I had were with a clear broth on the inside but this was not. There was scum inside and it was a lot richer than others I have tried. The scallion pancake was okay but a little greasy. The Shanghai noodle soup had a lot of veggies, which I was craving for during my trip, however it was pretty bland. Not sure if I just ordered the wrong items or if I came on a bad day, but I was not impressed.",0
"The soupy dumplings are definetely the thing to get, and they were really good and fun to try something different.  Otherwise, I wasn't overly impressed with the food.  We had the salt and pepper prawns--a little too fried for my likely.  They were good, but I wouldn't order them again.  
Also, I'm not sure how the line up works.  There were a few people waiting for tables when we got there, but we were still seated immediately, in front of the others who were waiting.  I can't complain, but not sure how that works.",0
"I really, really wanted to try this place. We even waited in line, and got inside and a table! Unfortunately we had to leave because they only offer their famous foods in pork and we don't eat pork :(",0
"The food was not bad in this china town restaurant. The waiters are rude, but in a really cool way. I tried ordering several different dumplings and they wouldn't allow it. He said it was too much. The only reason I gave it two stars, was for the cleanliness, it was pretty bad. I used the bathroom after I finished my meal and had I gone prior to ordering, I would have walked out.",0
"I'm not quite sure what the big deal about this place is - I tried their famous pork and crab XLB, and while they were the juicest dumplings I've ever had, they just weren't that good. The crab tasted stale and fishy, and was probably canned, not fresh. There was an enormous amount of broth in the dumplings, so if you have a XLB juice fetish, then perhaps Joe's is for you. However, I didn't think that the broth was that flavorful - it was kind of fishy and soupy, but not very rich. 

Joe's is not in the same league as Din Tai Fung, and it would be considered mediocre in the Bay Area.  That being said, as a San Francisco native, I do think that NYC Chinese (and East Coast Chinese in general) is pretty weird, so YMMV.

We also had an order of seafood rice cake noodles, which wasn't that good, but was better than the XLB.  The service was actually entertaining, since they try to shove as many people as possible into their restaurant as possible. The two of us shared our large round table with 3 other parties. I have no problem with the service, since busy, crowded, and rude usually correlates to excellent food, however the food wasn't that great, and I don't know why people rave about this place. Perhaps this might be good for NY, it's pretty bad for LA or SF.",0
"Joe's Shanghai has a been one of my favorite places for many years.  I just went this week and was surprised when my favorite, soupy dumplings tasted awful.  They were  filled half way with some oily brown broth not there usual delicious tasting yellowish broth.  The crab/pork filling well lets just say I would question whether it was crab/pork.  It was pretty bad.  The worst of it was that I took friends who also ordered it (because I bragged so much about them) and they couldn't even eat one. I tried to eat them anyway and after the 2nd one I through all of them out.  Very disappointing.  I'm hoping the Chef was just having a bad day.",0
"What I like - The food, quick service, price, and the oranges after the meal. What I don't like - The stink of that whole area when you are waiting outside, the rushed service, no rating on the window. I am so torn about this place and only go here (my third time) because my wife and our friends really like it. Chinatown is just really nasty.",0
I love this place. The dumplings are great. Waiters can be a bit pushy & I don't enjoy sitting with strangers and hearing x-rated convos about exes as I eat but other than that I love it !,0
"Horrible experience. 5:30 on a wednesday and it's packed. The servers work on an assembly line and treat you as if your chair's sitting on it.

Their focus is on getting you out. Asses on my shoulders as they place the plates down, arms reaching  across my head and face.

Had shredded pork with bean curd and jalopenos - flavorless, it was disgusting. 

My friend had the orange beef with broccoli that actually tasted ok while there but 2 hours later in turned into shrunken brown pieces of sweet dough-paste.

There's no need for me to ever go back. So many restaurants in the area have stepped their game up so bye Joe's Shanghai.

What a freaking illusion.

"Not worth the wait and this place is the literal definition of a tourist trap. The soup dumplings were not it. The skin of the soup dumpling was thick which usually isn't supposed to be the case. Staff had an attitude and a 18% automatic gratuity was applied. Even more troublesome, this place is cash only. 

If you want good soup dumplings, just avoid this place and go to Flushing.",0
"Eh.  I love Shanghainese dumplings, but I thought this place was just okay.  I was excited to try it too because I always hear about this place and how great it is.  We walked right in around 1PM and were seated right away.  They seat all small parties in a communal tables.  After about 10 minutes, it seemed like a tour bus unloaded into the restaurant because it was then super crowded.  We came just for the dumplings so we ordered one of each, the pork and the crab.  They were nice and juicy but the flavor and texture of the skin was just not as good as others we have tried.",0
"Expected a lot from this place as it has tons of good reviews, and the long wait for a table. The food was good but a bit oily and not super flavorful. They don't serve any bottled water and service wasn't great. Good location and well priced.",0
"Soup dumplings here weren't transcendent.  They were okay.
Not bad, but I've had better.  In the US.  On the East Coast.  Which suprised me immensely.",0
"I've heard a lot things about Joe's! It's definitely an institution in NYC. I was excited to try them out and decided to order delivery on UberEats. Everything came packed well and hot. That was probably the only good part about the meal. 

What I tried-

Pork Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings): 
These were gigantic and came with 6 pieces which I thought was a great deal! However these had little to no flavor and were extremely greasy. For XLB/soup dumplings, I understand the fat helps with the juiciness and flavor of the dumpling/soup but this has literally no flavor. The vinegar it came with with also too sour. I ended up using vinegar that I had at home (the Lee Kum Kee brand) and that made it a bit easier to eat. Would not order these again. 

Shanghai Noodle Soup:
You get to pick what type of noodle you want for this dish but again, nothing helped since this was also flavorless. It was packed with veggies and shreds of pork but literally no salt, no spice, no seasoning. I honestly thought I caught COVID since I couldn't taste anything. The noodles were a nice texture and the pork had some flavor but that was it. I would not order this again. 

Again, this was a to go order so I didn't go to the restaurant or see the inside or anything so I can't comment on ambiance. I was very disappointed with my meal though and I hate leaving bad reviews but this was a waste of time and money. There are better options in Chinatown. 2 stars since the food is edible. Hopefully they change things up and improve their seasoning.",0
"So after seeing various New York foodie YouTube vids/vlogs and reading the Yelp reviews, I finally had my opportunity to go and see what the hype was all about with regards to Joe's Shanghai and their soup dumplings (XLB). And here are my honest opinions...

Coming from Southern California, Asian food is already good here. There's no doubt about that. But I was curious as to see what made Joe's Shanghai's soup dumplings unique versus the soup dumplings here Mama Lu's at Monterey Park or Din Tai Fung (I have yet to try DTF because I personally think that DTF's XLB is overpriced af). Plus, my friends and I wanted to visit Chinatown in NYC so that was one of the perks of coming here during our NYC trip haha.

When we arrived to Joe's Shanghai, it was around 8:30PM and it was still packed. We waited for a good 15-20 minutes before we were seated. One thing that I immediately noticed about this place was how many tourists were dining at this place. And by tourists...I mean by how many Caucasians were at Joe's Shanghai. It was an interesting observation because I would assume mostly Asians would dine at Asians restaurants but like no joke, it was mostly white people dining in hahaha. Extremely touristy. When I noticed that, I kinda knew that this would be some sort of a tourist trap but hey, I wanted to give this place a chance. Interestingly, a passerby-er shouted out that Joe's was a tourist trap right in front of the restaurant and we should try somewhere else LOL.

The wait wasn't too bad. Though, it was extremely packed inside. And extremely loud and obnoxious...like your typical Asian restaurant.There are a bunch of large, family style tables but you're bound to share a table with fellow strangers. From what I remembered, we ordered the XLB, fried rice, and orange chicken. The fried rice and orange chicken were alright. The orange chicken literally tasted like oranges so it was a nice version of this common dish. Though, nothing too special but a little overpriced in my opinion.

As for the XLB, what I do like about Joe's XLB is that I do believe that their soup:dumpling ratio is on point. It was served hot when it arrived (as it should). In each XLB, there is a right amount of soup per each bite and it's extremely juicy. Prices here are fairly cheaper than DTF but Mama Lu's is still slightly cheaper, I believe. Though, my criticism of Joe's Shanghai's XLB is the flavor of the soup.The soup in the XLB at Mama Lu's is much richer and more flavorful than at Joe's Shanghai. Plus, I believe that at Mama Lu's, the soup dumplings contain more soup flavor than actual dumpling (so every bite turns out amazingly delicious and rich, which I actually like to be honest). The other food entrees at Mama Lu's are much more appetizing and affordable than at Joe's Shanghai. To be honest, I was missing and craving more of Mama Lu's XLB because I miss the complex, rich flavor of their soup dumplings.

Overall, it was pretty meh and I was sorta let down of Joe's Shanghai. Indeed, it is a tourist trap. Honestly, I wouldn't go out of my way to get XLB here since I know that there are some pretty bomb XLB here in Southern California. It was a good experience though!",0
"Decent grub - I didn't really enjoy the flavors
I don't expect fine dining but the xiao long bao just wasn't sitting right with me.

Cheap prices comparatively to other joints but not so clear service . This may be a hot spot in NY but I just didn't like it so much :/",0
"It's true the crab and pork soup dumplings are exceptional. We also had the Chinese cabbage with dried shrimp platter, the scallion pancakes, and mushroom and bamboo shoots. All were tasty though the two vegetable dishes could have eased up on the saucing - the ingredients shine all on their own! 

My beef had to do with the experience - waiting for a table is not unheard of, but once you sit down, I'd really like to not be further rushed. We ordered several dishes and they came nearly all at once. Our order for a party of 5 overwhelmed the surface area of the table we were sharing with another couple, and left little room for their dishes. Additionally, sitting on the aisle side of the restaurant meant I was hit no less than 5 times by passing servers, other patrons' bags, and the like, and these were no slight pats, but ones that sent my head or arm knocking forward to disrupt items on the table. Managing the crowds or staff is clearly not high on JS' priority list.   

I'm glad I came once for the famous dumplings but if the rest is part of the charm of JS, I'd rather opt out.",0
"Definitely overrated.  There is always always ALWAYS a line to Joe's Shanghai and I always hear about the good reviews.  I finally gave in and went to try this place with my sister and her friends.  It was a disappointing visit for us.  The food was OK.  Maybe we were just unlucky but some of the dishes we ordered were just too salty and I don't know what happened to my dumplings.  It was dry; where did all the soup go??? 
Shanghai Cafe offers better dumplings for sure (although the service not so much).  

I personally wouldn't recommend the food.  However, if you want to go with the crowd, be my guest!  They do offer ok service, better than nothing!",0
"Coming to new york, this was the first place my family visited. The service was okay, but our food came out in the weirdest orders. Once we finished ordering, scallion pancakes came out right away. We ordered two XLB, and it took 20 minutes after the scallion pancakes. However, only one reached the table and then it took another 10 minutes for the other XLB to hit the table. Flavor wise, everything tasted great, just wished both of them arrived at the table because it was sort of weird waiting for food once the dishes were done. Additionally, my family ordered noodles and soft shell crabs and they didn't reach the table for quite awhile. Everything tasted great, just wished it did not take so long for food to hit the table and was hoping they would the table all at once like a normal family dinner.",0
"I ordered the pork dumplings, string beans, and stirred fried noodle. I think the pork dumpling tasted mediocre. It also didn't have a fixed shape but more of a saggy look to it. The string beans was probably my favorite but could have been cooked with less oil and same goes for the stirred fried noodle. It was just too oily and gave such an unpleasant taste to the mouth. 

Overall, I think the food tasted good for its price but I'm not sure if I would come back here a second time.",0
"I have a soft spot for this place - the Xiao long bao are not ideal size, texture, or flavor balance, yet I still come back and will pound two trays solo... 

Joe's is the White Castle of Xiao long baos - tasty, cheap, greasy, and utilitarian.  I love them even if I know there's better :) 

Cash only and you may share a table with someone",0
"Had high hopes for this place because of how popular it is, but not worth the hype in my opinion. Our party of 6 came around 7 on a rainy Tuesday evening, and we were seated within 10-15 min. It was super crowded, and we were sat at a table against the wall--a bit tight of a fit but cozy enough for our party. 

To be honest, only the pork soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) were good (nice meat to soup ratio!). Everything else was just okay (lacking flavor)--we ordered jellyfish (too much oil), two meat dishes (chicken and cucumbers and shredded meat that came with wraps), and one veggie dish (tofu skin/broccoli/carrots). It was only $16 per person with tip, which is such a steal for the amount of food we had, so you can't beat Chinatown dinner prices. I would maybe come back for the soup dumplings/give their Midtown location a try, but there are other restaurants in the area with tastier dishes.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is really good. For most of my friends this is their first experience with soup dumplings-which are the must order items on the menu. Also, its important to note, unless you have a shellfish allergy, order the soup dumplings with crab in them. They are 1000x better than the pork ones. Joe's Shanghai is always a fun option because it is always busy and the food is always good. I think you can find better food in NY but for the cost and the experience, it is a must visit.",0
"I've heard good things about this place but was a little underwhelmed. The soup dumplings were not my favorite-- they were really big but the soup was too fatty. I prefer a cleaner broth, and the skin was too thick for my liking.",0
"cash only. no credit cards. be prepared to wait and share table with other. the dumplings are amazing. we can finish 2 orders of crab meat dumplings easily. that will set you back $25 bucks... or so.
Recommended if you are in nyc",0
"Ok so many emotions about this place. If you go make sure you go early the lines get long very fast. Oh and don't forget cash, they only accept cash but do offer a ATM at a fee. 
 First the food was awesome we had the dim sum , fried crispy noodles, general tso chicken and lo mein. All was absolutely delicious. How I went this long without ever having pork and crab dumplings is beyond me.... 

 Service isn't very friendly, you get rushed around and once you place your order you never see your sever again. Until it's time to hunt him down for your bill. Also keep in",0
"Overhyped! Horrible service, very dirty place, food wasn't even that good to be honest... Overall bad experience . Once again, horrible service",0
"We were strolling by Chinatown this weekend so decided to check this place out as it came out right on top on Yelp.
We ordered the usual suspects - going by all the rave reviews here; soup dumplings, scallion pancakes and pan fried noodles.

Soup dumplings were delicious and worth all the hype, the scallion pancakes were even better taste wise, however, a tad oily. Same with the noodles too, tasted well except the oil again. Going only by the food, I would've given them 4 stars.
But - the service! How can I forget that - all the reviews below are quite accurate in describing the horrendous service. The waiter glares at you scornfully as if daring you to ask for anything  except the specific order. When I asked for a fork he mumbled something in Chinese which I couldn't understand.
Again, when we asked for the check and presented a card he shouted ""NO CARD, ONLY CASH"" as if we had committed a grave error. And while returning the change he conveniently retained the bill (perhaps to hide the auto deducted 15% service charge hoping we wouldn't see it and tip him again), and when we asked to be provided with the bill he AGAIN mumbled something in Chinese pretty scornfully and grudgingly got us our bill.

Phew, not sure I would want to return for this kind of service again!
Maybe get something to go if you really have to.",0
Mediocre at best. It's not good soup dumplings. Pinch's is better.,0
"Supposed to be the mecca of shanghai dumplings in NY.  I just thought they were okay.  The service wasn't anything special.  Most dumplings broke when removing them from the steamer.  Had to share a table with another set of people, it wasn't a big issue, just something to note.

The food came out fast, I just wasn't wowed.  Apparently everyone else loves this place, so give it a try for yourself.",0
"Too much hype! I was really excited to try their famous xiao long bao, but I will have to agree with a bunch of other Yelpers that this place is overrated. Maybe it is just because I found the dumplings to be too flavorful and fatty.  I must admit the dumplings had the most soup that I have ever seen inside a xiao long bao, but the soup got sickening.  After a few I would bite the skin, and pour the soup out into a bowl. Eventuall I started only eating the skin and tossing the meat as well.  The scallion pancake was good, but a little too doughy than what I am use to.  Joe's Shanghai was a cheap meal compared to other eats in NYC, but I still wouldn't choose to revisit this establishment. Oh and being Chinese, of course, they seated us at a table with three other pairs of people.  I like to be able to eat my food in the company of the people I came with, not strangers!",0
"Not the best dumplings or noodles, but passable. Also had the green beans. Think that that was our favorite dish.",0
"When I read about the long waits and the raves about the dumplings, I expected to be wowed.  That is the danger of high expectations.  This is no Din Tai Fung, my friends.  I thought the soup dumplings were too sour, and a couple fell apart in getting transferred to the spoon.  The crispy beef was pretty good, and the scallion pancakes were tasty, but nothing to write home about.",0
"Food was all around very good, especially the pork soup dumplings.  The pork fried rice was great and a big portion, too.  Some of the dishes were a bit on the salty side but could be just me, since others in my group didn't seem to mind.

The service was good, if a bit rushed, but prompt and response for the most part.  

The decor is... nothing to write home about.  Your typical (?) Chinese restaurant that's been in business for years and years and have not renovated in years and years.  But all in all, clean ""enough"".

Only true negative is that 15% service charge is automatically added on the bill, so when you are paying, be sure to check and not double-tip.  And they only take cash.",0
I found a fly cooked on top of my dumpling. still got charged for meal. Disgusting!! Do not recommend,0
"Came here with my gf for dinner around 8pm on a thursday. It's about 1/2 hour wait they said but I'm sure we waited for at least 45 mins. It is super packed and crowded.  We had to share a table with a party of four that was finishing their meal. Ordered the scallion pancake, shanghai flat noodle, pork soup dumplings and crab soup dumplings. The food was ok but the soup dumplings were warm at best when it came out. I kept on getting hit by the waiters when they walk by because I sat on the edge and it was so packed. When the party of 4 left, the waiters were cleaning/wiping down the table shaking the whole table while we were eating. I thought that was pretty inconsiderate. Then they seated 2 more parties of 2. Yes, that's 3 different parties of 2 in one table. Awkward. In conclusion, nothing spectacular and there are other shanghai places in CT that ain't as crowded.",0
So overrated!!! Absolutely not worth the wait. The soup dumplings were good but their Beef & Broccoli was so tasteless.  We will never go back,0
"Had been this place 5 yrs ago, and really liked it. So I choose here to be my first stop this time. But the soup dumpling doesn't taste as good as before. Cash only but still charged tax. Really disappointed.",0
"Came here with three other people and had an obscene number of xiao long bao. They were pretty juicy, but not as delicate as I'd like them to be.",0
"So overrated, so full of tourists, so cramped. Asked for a table for 2. Saw 2 seats clearly available near the front and asked if those two pointing to the seats were ready. The hostess said we have to see... But then was told to go to the back. Ended up sharing a huge round table with 2 other families. Awkward and cramped. The soup dumplings were fine nothing special. The meat sauce noodles were fine but the noodles were too mushy. As we left I saw that the table that was available ended up being given to two white tourists. Interesting seeing as they don't take reservations those seats could not be reserved. I also asked for ice water 3 times because it was boiling hot in there but didnt get it until the end of our meal. Will not be returning to this restaurant.",0
"The soup dumplings are very disappointing - skin is too thick, size is too big, and presentation is just awful (maybe I'm asking for too much for a 8.75 soup dumplings).

And the service was very bad - below average Chinatown level - so why includes the tip amount in the final bill?",0
"This place is for tourists that don't know good Chinese food. Greasy, not friendly. I have no idea how they even got a rating. The place is filthy.",0
"Stopped by here with the BFs parents and sister visiting from Japan; I knew this place was known for soup dumplings (even showed up in the Japanese New York guide..) so three stars doesn't really reflect the quality of their soup dumplings (I'm a vegetarian).

The rest of the guests seemed to really like it.  But as for the rest of the regular Chinese restaurant offerings, the food was pretty standard.  I had some clams with black bean sauce which were clearly pre-frozen clams.  Again, standard.  

Wait was about 45 minutes even around 2PM, and service was spotty as Chinese-restaurant usual.",0
Took my mom here when she was in town visiting.  She's a picky eater and doesn't usually eat a lot of different cuisines besides Chinese and Japanese.  We went here for dim sum and we both thought the food was mediocre.  My mom kept saying how she could get better dim sum in New Orleans.,0
"the soup dumplings are certainly tasty, but their wrapper is a little too thick for my liking and the top is always a little tough. i wish din tai fung opened in nyc already.

we also had the hot and sour soup and that was below average. it tasted like third-rate takeout hot and sour, not what i expect from a place like joe's shanghai. 

service is attentive and fast. 

i would go back for the dumplings and nothing else. my experience at their midtown location was average as well.",0
"First off, if you're looking for Joe's Shanghai, don't be confused by the nearby ""Joe's Ginger"" which is also nearby. I was walking here using Google Maps and it said ""I had arrived"" but all I saw was Joe's Ginger. Luckily, I kept walking just to be sure and found Joe's Shanghai, which I was expecting to be more of a stand-out place.

It was something like 8:30pm when I arrived and the place was still packed and there was a line outside. I stepped inside to put my name on the list. I told a woman I was there by myself and she directed me to follow the group ahead of me to be seated. I was concerned about the line of people waiting outside and wanted to clarify whether she really meant to seat me. She snapped at me and told me in a very rude tone to ""go ahead"" as if I was some idiot.

I was seated at a large round table with seating for 10, along with two other parties. It was weird as we didn't introduce ourselves. We ordered separately and were billed separately. 

Having heard so much about Joe's Shanghai, I assumed this place accepted credit cards. But it's cash only. So I walked in there with just $30 in my pocket and was scrambling to have an adequate meal for under $30. I knew I wanted the soup dumplings (xiao long bao) but I did not think that alone would fill me up, so I also ordered the Shanghai noodles. 

Together, the dishes did fill me up. I was disappointed in the dumplings. Not impressive at all, at least after having them from Din Tai Fung. I ate at Din Tai Fung in the LA area a few months ago and was so blown away that I've been on a soup dumpling kick ever since. People kept telling me to try Joe's Shanghai and so I made my way out to NYC for them. (Of course, I had other business here).

Compared to Din Tai Fung, the dumplings here are not even comparable. In fact, no better than some random Chinese food places I've tried in the interim. Objectively, without comparing them to Din Tai Fung, I would not be impressed with soup dumplings here, and if I tried them for the first time here, I would not even say I like soup dumplings in general. They were fine, but nothing to rave about. 

The Shanghai noodles were thicker than I thought they'd be, and really greasy. But they were tasty in the moment.

The service at Joe's Shanghai is non-existent. People come to pick up plates once you've cleared them, but you have to flag them down for more water or if you want anything else. 

There are pictures along the wall of celebrities who have eaten here, and that makes you feel like you're eating in a really happening spot. But the fame is self-perpetuating and the novelty of it all is really the only reason to seek this place out. The food here is okay, but it's not some sort of wonderful experience that you need to go out of your way for. 

Overall, I'm glad I got to try this place out because I would always wonder if I didn't. But I paid for eating here the next day, when I kept having to run out of meetings to go to the bathroom multiple times throughout the day. That has only ever happened to me when I'm overseas, typically in Asia. 

Be warned that the food here may mess up your digestive system for a day or two. Though on second thought, if you want a dining experience that approximates what eating in China would be like, then maybe Joe's Shanghai is worth a try after all.",0
"I hate Joe's Shanghai. What Chinese person in their right mind likes to frequent this place? (I'll tell you. Mostly 2nd or 3rd gens bringing their mostly white or non-Chinese friends. Is this some sort of initiation?) I don't know a single Shanghai-nese person that would ever recommend this place to anyone. The soup dumplings are good, but the rest of their food is disgusting. You're already in Chinatown. go to a good Chinese restaurant! If you want a better Shanghainese restaurant, please continue walking down the street! 

Here is my one disclaimer though, both the Elmhurst (which is no longer) and Flushing restaurants have better food. And no tourists or poseur Chinese. If you feel you really have to go, please go to the one in Queens instead. Otherwise, why bother?",0
"This is my usual dinner destination when ever i have friends visiting from out of town.  Come in groups of 4 and more for your own table otherwise, you are seated at a communal table with other diners.  I personally prefer having my own table to enjoy my meal.  The SOUP DUMPLINGS and SCALLION PANCAKES are my favorite.  Every time I'm in the neighborhood, there's always a line waiting to be seated.  Normally i bail out once the waiting period exceeds 30 minutes, but my craving of the soup dumplings just makes the wait worth-it.  They  have other dishes that are very good as well,  but i feel i can get those at  nearby restaurants with no lines.  Just a warning though, please check your bill before paying, seems like there's a hidden 15% gratuity already added to your bill written in Mandarin.",0
"Don't expect service when you come here, do expect to sit at a large communal table, do expect to be ignored, do expect greasy delicious food. I felt horrible after leaving here. Had the crab and pork soup dumplings which I would have loved in another life but I felt like I was sucking down on lard this time- couldn't handle more than one. Had the corn and chicken soup which turned into gelatinous slop once it cooled, had the beef Lo mein- thick delicious noodles but coated in a layer of fat and grease. Have had much tastier food in other local spots with less guilt attached..Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles puts this place to shame.",0
"I was visiting from LA and was passing by and decided to stop in and get one tray of soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. I wasn't that impressed. My NY friends to me this place was better than Din Tai Fung, but I didn't love it. The soup felt greasy. The pancakes were too ""bready"". We wished it were crispier. Overall service was good and there was no wait, always a good thing.",0
"Probably one of my least favorite Chinese restaurant, came here for the hype of the soup dumpling. Which was okay in my opinion, it's to be expected to have a wait to be seated or be seated with another group at a table. Service was delayed but food was delivered. Not sure if I will go back, maybe in a few more months id think about giving it another try.",0
Losing stars because of the long wait and lack of communication as to how long.  The seaters can even be rude.  BUT... Once inside the food is like no other Chinese food.  Its soooo good!! And the soup dumplings are a must try and enjoy.  I dont think I would return to THIS location.  The other I hear is easier to get into.,0
"Considering there's not a lot of good chinese restaurants in all of New York, this might very well be the best New York has to offer. Even so, I find it to be very pedestrian. Perhaps I've been spoiled by the generous restaurant selections available in Los Angeles or maybe I'm just a picky eater. Whatever the case may be, I found that the XLB (Xiao Long Bao) had no distinction. The dumplings were mostly filled with broth. There was very little meat inside. The wrappers were very thick and sticky, making it unpleasant to chew.

One thing that stood out at this restaurant is that you can expect to find yourselves sharing a large circular table with one or two other parties due to the small space and limited seating. This might be a fairly common practice in New York restaurants, but I have never encountered this before and it was something I took notice of.",0
The line was extremely long which made my anticipation grow! I had high expectations with all the reviews. I was looking forward to a nice Chinese dinner. The dumplings were definitely the highlight of my meal. The beef udon was okay. The eggplant was too sweet and the spicy Szechuan beef was not good. I wouldn't order those again nor recommend it. If your in the area and there isn't a wait get dumplings but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. It is not comparable to Din Tai Fung if your from the west coast.,0
"OK Shanghainese food. Got better quality in Shanghai Cafe on Mott St. instead. This place has gotten too touristy. Most people that come here are not Chinese. We had to share a table, got so-so Shanghainese food, & got slapped with an automatic (not optional) 15% gratuity fee on the bill. There was only 3 of us!!! Like I said tourist rip-off!",0
"It has moved to a new location. 46 Browerlu is the current address. I called the restaurant twice to ask for the direction, and the person who answered the phone just told me to keep walking. I had mentioned the old address, but she had never informed me the new address.",0
"TERRIBLE VISIT! 
The servers are very disrespectful.. And the quality of the food is just not even presentable anymore. The noodles are burnt, and the soup dumplings are barely hot. The price that you pay for the amount of food is not even worth it. Let's come to conclusion, JOES SHANGHAI is one of the worst, and most over rated soup dumpling place. Everyone needs to realize that the amount you pay here isn't worth it anymore!",0

For a dumpling specialist they do not have many dumping choices at all. Maybe 3 options. The soup inside the dumpling was very tasty. The dumplings were too big and wide in my opinion. They didn't fit on the spoon and would explode before my mouth. Not the best dumplings at all.

"Although previous visits of Joe's Shanghai have been ok and regardless of the fact that I think their dumplings (xiao long bao) are over-hyped*, I was unprepared for the disappointment their take-out dishes will bring. 

The shrimp fried rice had no shrimp.  I tell you, the corner Chinese restaurant where we live had better fried rice.  The Shanghai beef noodles was terribly bland and had about two tiny pieces of beef. It was very thoughtful of the husband to go out of his way to buy their food thinking it will make me happy and save me from making dinner, so I did not grumble about the food as we ate. 

Joe's Shanghai, I think I just love the memory of you.  It's time to move on.

*The dough is too thick and the size unwieldy unlike that of CB.",0
I was looking forward to some great Chinese food in NYC.  This was so disappointing.  The atmosphere is like an mcl cafeteria.  The waiter boys are lazy and not particularly friendly. My husbands dish came out a good 15 minutes before mine.  The sesame chicken was over cooked and dry.  They only take cash but there is an atm inside the front door.  They automatically put a surcharge on your tab which explained why the waiters had an attitude.,0
"We went to this Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown based on high rating hype. The restaurant's on a side street was not exacting easy to find using the online navigation provided. It was busy around late lunch time but there was no wait. We could tell all customers were out of town tourists. Belatedly we found out they do not accept credit card so our menu selections were limited. We chose Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings, aka Pork Steamed Buns (the main motivation of our visit) and String Bean, a typical Szechuan style vegetable dish.  We found the steamed dumplings larger in size than the usual, dainty ones we had tasted elsewhere. After eating 2 orders of these, we concluded that they were excessively soupy (watch out for plenty hot liquid squirting out at first bite) and doughy. The string beans were average. Watch out: we noted they automatically added a 15% service charge on the bill (for a party of 2) which seemed unusual to us.",0
"It's just OK. 

I used to hate XLB so much because my bad experience in the past. I remembered the thick flour and fatty ground pork that I used to eat. When I used to live in Shanghai, I tried to stay away from them.

Since I moved to NY, my friend convinced me to go to Nan Xiang in Flushing and that was the first time after 10 years that I stopped eating them. It's not like what I had in the past. I start liking it ......so much now... 

So last night I had a craving for it, then I picked this famous place in the city. I went with high expectation that it's gonna be just so good like the one in Flushing. We ordered 2 kinds of XLB and all I can say that I only like the soup. After I drank the soup in each one I almost wanted to leave the meat and the flour. We also ordered Shanghai fried noodles and strangely I like it better than the famous XLB. Fried Man Tou is good to order as dessert since it came with condensed milk.

Can't go wrong with the price. It's cheap and worth trying their XLB so that you know there're better places out there.",0
Not really sure how to say not the taste that I like the dumpling top little bit tough the price are ok,0
"Usual NY crowd on a Friday night. We lucked out to get a big table since it was close to 10pm. Had the soup dumplings, green beans, scallops, beef, shrimp and tons of beer. 
Loud, inspires you to eat a lot, sweat a lot. 
I like it.",0
"Don't come here if you like friendly service, the staff is extremely rude. Also don't come here if you would like to eat anything else than pork. You can only pay cash, but they tell you AFTER you ask for the check. You can use their ATM, but they charge you $3,50 for that on top of the gratuity. Seriously don't understand why this place gets 5 star reviews. Will never ever come back to this dirty place.",0
"I looked up ""Best soup dumplings in NYC"" on google and this restaurant came up in a blog for top 10. 

Just to warn you, the shanghai dumplings here are NOT good. The meat is questionable. Pretty bummed! We left without finishing them. I do not believe this was an anomaly, I'm questioning whether any people with positive reviews of the dumplings on here know the difference between good and bad Chinese food.

If you're ever in SF, I recommend Mama Jis for dim sum and szechuan food, and Shanghai Dumpling King for dumplings.",0
"Their crab soup dumplings are a solid 4 stars. The rest of their food? eh.

I had their pork dumplings, crab dumplings, scallion pancake, and their shredded turnip cake. The shredded turnip cake had a short black hair inside of it.... The waiter cut open the cake for me and right when I put my chopstick inside of it, the top of the flaky pastry turned over to reveal the nasty hair. If it weren't for this, I would have given the place 3 stars. I showed the waiter and he didn't seem to care or offer to even replace my turnip cake. Maybe there was a language barrier? I don't know but it was disgusting to see the hair on the dough since it had to have been pretty visible when the cake was being made. Its not as if it was mixed in the filling or anything. Just literally right on the inside surface of the pastry.

That really put a damper in the rest of the meal. Anyways, the scallion pancake was alright but nothing amazing as other people claimed it to be. The turnip cake (I still ate the other half. Was that gross of me? haha) was alright as well.

Since Joe's is famous for their soup dumplings, I ordered both types. The pork was a bit too salty for me but the crab was very delicious. If you're going, I would avoid the pork since they weren't really worth it. 

**TIP** Eat the soup dumplings RIGHT when you get them. Don't wait to finish your appetizers or anything because once they cool, the soup starts to separate and the flavors aren't blended anymore. Not only that, they start to leak from the top if you wait too long. 

I question their sanitary habits but the crab dumplings would make me come back!",0
"Cheap Shanghai Dumplings that aren't that great...

I came here since people rave about their Shanghai Dumplings, but I thought it was a little too salty and I did not like the skin of the dumplings. It was too big and that it droops over. Texture was not great. 

I'm sure there's better else where.",0
"Great food, but it went right through me (within 3 hours). Do not recommend if you're trying to get lucky.",0
"Really wanted to be wowed by this place but alas my expectations were too high. 

They add an automatic 18% gratuity so there is less incentive for good service to be provided. Our waiter was so brusque and rude when taking our order.  We felt pressured and rushed.  He didn't understand English so I could not engage him at all. 

The food is brought out in fast assembly like dumping slaw in a trough to hurry you out and make room for the next group of pigs. 

The beef and broccoli was ok except the meat tasted a tad gamey. I did not finish it. 

The pork fried rice was ok but lacked the traditional bean sprouts and i had to spit out a nervy piece of pork.",0
"The soup dumplings didn't WOW me, I've definitely had far better.  Service was also not very good, it took about 40 minutes to get our dumplings... meanwhile, several tables around us had gotten theirs' even though they showed up after us.  We had the standard pork, my friend says the crab & pork are simply not worth the extra expense.  Overall, it was a solid and cheap meal.  Would I go back?  Probably, but I'd like to try some other soup dumpling places in the area first ;)",0
"I have been living in NYC for five years and this is the first time that I have tried this place.  
My first thought, is that its WAY overhyped.  I came here today not even really at a real meal time and it was still packed mid afternoon. I ordered the pork soup dumplings and even at first glance, they are smaller than others in the area, not as fluffy, and honestly kinda sad looking .  Upon trying them they were ok, a tiny portion of meat in each bun with hot soup around it.  
I ordered two portions of the soup dumplings, 16 in total and shared them.  I also ordered a scallion pancake which was pretty good.  

All in al, ive been to better places that have soup dumplings, this place has the fame in the name so I guess thats why it continues to be popular. Ill give it three stars because the prices were pretty decent and they waiters are english speaking and speed effecient.",0
"Not the greatest, not the worst.  If you are with a large group it will take a while to get in.  If you're by yourself or someone else, it won't be a problem to get in.  

The food is your standard American Chinese variety.  Nothing special.  The dumplings are good though.  

Service is hectic and they try to bring people in and out ASAP, which makes the atmosphere a bit chaotic.  

Cash only and tip is included.  I suppose they kept getting stiffed by tourists, so can't blame them there.",0
"I have to say I am very dissapointed in this restaurant, it opened not too long ago at the new location on Bowery and the wait was usually 40 minutes(tourist trap) today we walked by and it was no wait so we decided to give it a shot I been to the old joes over five years ago and was not a fan, gave it a second chance.. the appetizer arrived first and we were all excited and starving their soup dumplings is plump that's where they get one star.. that is one of the better soup dumplings in Chinatown it's comparable to shanghai cafe and 21 shanghai, shanghai cafe is better IMO. Their kao fu, sweet tofu with mushroom was also a hit... it's a cold appetizer dish. Everything else that came after was lacking in everything it was either way too sour for the sweet and sour fish, too salty and bland for the chicken, too breaded and salty for the pork chops and the pig feet even though drenched in sauce managed to be dry and salty and the only thing my coworkers thought was decent was the string beans cause it wasn't terrible(it was just bland).. if you do come I recommend sticking with the appetizers and their soup dumplings.",0
"Was greeted in the beginning by a nice young lady. As soon as we hit the table the service was bad, poor customer service and the food was mediocre. For having so many celebrities here I was surprised.",0
"So I've heard a lot of hype about this restaurant, but it was a pretty unimpressive experience for me. The soup dumplings were great, but the two other dishes my friend and I ordered were nothing special at all. One of the dishes we ended up barely touching, and neither of us were interested in bringing it home and eating later. I've had better Chinese food in plenty of other places. Also, the service was really mediocre. I never got the glass of water I asked for at the beginning, and I felt like the waiters were giving us attitude. I would give one star, but the soup dumplings were good, so two-stars.",0
Poor service. Rude workers. Went with my family. They gave a 4 seated table. We needed 2 more and they were refusing to accommodate. They left us standing in the middle of the restaurant until we decided to leave because it was awkward and unfair. Nasty people,0
"The dumplings weren't bad, although the service was not great. We felt rushed to finish and leave. Bathroom was clean.",0
"It's really not delicious, me and my friend are very disappointed. The wine chicken and the crab meat dumplings no any flavor, this is my first time to leave bad review on public. No good service you have to pick up the food and bring it to your table. Even during the Covid-19, other restaurants offer patio dining service but this one they want you to bring it food.",0
"Ordered take out so avoided the wait

Had to try the legendary soup dumplings which were okay.

Server also suggested we try their Turnip Dumplings which she was a best seller. Husband tried it first and with a straight face warned me that it was the most disgusting thing he'd ever tasted.

I thought he was being dramatic so I tried it. I couldn't swallow (and I always swallow! ba da bing!!). It tasted like runners feet.",0
"Tourist trap! Don't go, especially if you are vegetarian. They pre-added a service charge on our bill, even with 2 people. Food was mediocre at best.",0
"My husband and I went here thinking third times a charm for Yelp restaurant recommendations in NYC. At least that's what I was expecting with Joe's, but we only had a good experience rather than amazing.

We took the subway in and knew we'd found the right place when we turned the corner on Pell Street and saw about twenty tourists standing outside. 

Things to remember:
1. Bring cash, but if you forget, there's a Bank of America around the corner. 

2. If you have a party of two or one, you'll be seated fifteen minutes faster than the crowds waiting outside, which was a pleasant surprise for us. 

3. Once inside, expect to share a table with total strangers and hold conversations with them.

4. Stick to the rolls. Everyone else has said it, but the reason to go here is for those perfect little inverted balls of soup. I didn't know what to expect, so when the server mumbled something to us I remembered a previous recommendation and said, ""Yes, pork."" In minutes we had two beers and a steaming pile of beautiful dumplings. Once I bit into them I realized why they're SOUP dumplings -- they seal the soup liquid inside of a little dumpling sack with the pork. This would typically be a fun treat, but my first unexpected bite resulted in a burnt tongue from hot soup and a mess all over my plate! After my third dumpling I'd mastered the art of drinking the soup and then eating the dumpling, but it's hysterical to watch the entire restaurant as they attempt to tackle such a delicious and silly food.

5. The rest of the food is hearty, but nothing out of the ordinary for a Chinese restaurant. I wish we'd stuck to the dumplings and tried the crab ones. One serving of eight dumplings per person and you don't need a mediocre entree.

6. Gratuity is included. There are signs on the wall to remind you that gratuity is included and the check comes out quickly once you're done along with a little plate of orange slices.

We had a fun experience and got to know the other people seated our table. I think families, friends, small groups and couples will get a kick out of the experience, too. Just keep in mind, the dumplings are great, but the rest of the food isn't four star quality. I wish they'd open a stand outside of the restaurant where you can order a big sack of dumplings to go!",0
"Came here with a group and waited for well over an hour to be seated.  When we finally arrived at our table, we hadn't even taken off our coats before the waiter appeared and asked ""How many dumplings do you want?"".  We told him we hadn't even sat down yet and needed a minute.  30 seconds later he re-appears and asks the same question.  Again, we told him we needed a minute.  This time he gave us a full 3 minutes to decide what we wanted.  We ordered and the food arrived extremely quickly, which was great, but it took 5 tries and talking to 3 different waiters to get a glass of water.

As others have mentioned, the soup dumplings are awesome.  So are the scallion pancakes, soups and lo mein.  However, the employees are only focused on turning over tables and not customer service.  Amazingly delicious Chinese food, but don't expect a particularly pleasant dining experience.",0
"This place is so much over rated. Food quality is just okay, even for the soup dumplings where they are famous for. There are better quality else where. They also added 18% tips to the bill automatically for a party of 4.",0
"Everyone loves Joe's little soup dumplings.

But everytime I went there, I couldn't stop myself from geting so full loaded with dumplings that I sweared to myself I won't come back again until next  year... ^_^...

Didn't like...
I really didn't feel comfortable to share tables with other guests...",0
I had an incredibly disappointing experience at Shanghai Joe. The service was absolutely horrible. The food was pretty good but not enough to make up for the poor service as the waiter was also extremely rude and unprofessional. He was dismissive and acted like our presence was an inconvenience to him. Save yourself the trouble and find somewhere else to eat as there are places like Chow House which have better food.,0
"The servers are rude, mandatory 15% service charge is added, and the worst part was that the soup dumplings had no soup inside them. They were over cooked.. I saw another tray go to a different table and theirs looked fine. It would have been better if they apologized and cooked us a new batch.. But that didn't happen. Very disappointed!",0
"Cheap, filling, greasy, tasty.   Was playing tour guide to some friends from out of town (Houston, Palm Springs and San Diego) and we needed a nosh after going on a wild goose chase to buy bootleg purses*.  

Anyway, we walked by and there wasn't a wait so we dashed in to grab some salty nourishment. I say this because everything here seems kind of salty.  We had the soup dumplings, scallion pancakes and fried dumplings.  The fried dumplings were nothing special.  Very generic and I wish we hadn't ordered them.

The scallion pancakes were great, however.  I liked getting the pieces that were a little well done.  Soup dumplings (or pork buns, whatever you want to call them) were great.  I really like them.

Service is bruque but efficient.  They really get people in and out and fit in as many people as possible, so make friends with the other people sitting at your table.

For my out of town friends, they thought it was cool.  I'd go back, but I'd never wait more than five minutes for a table.  We all left stuffed to the gills and it set us back $7 each.

*Side note: I don't approve of that, but the girls didn't want to hear any of my objections, they just wanted the faux Tory Burch bags-",0
"Vegetable dumplings were delicious as well as the noodles and that's about it.  

Orange beef was tough as nails and overall food is way overpriced for what you get.  $20 plus dollars for Kung Pow Chicken and even more for the Orange Beef.  Get very little and the side of rice was nearly non existent. 

Look for a hole in the the wall with lower prices.  This place is not worth it.",0
"This is the standard of soup dumplings.  This is not necessarily a quick place.  You sit at tables with other strangers and order your food because it is cramped. *Cash only.

I don't ever look at the menu.  I just get the soup dumplings - some pork, some crab.  I think it was like 4.45/6.45 per batch.My brother and I each ate 2 containers (8 in each container) to start our day of New York eating.  

I wish there was a return policy on broken skin - where the soup has already come out.  Although there were only 3 broken ones, it's all about the juicy soup that your slurp up.

People talk about this place or other places being better/worse every now and then.  I have had better or worse, but this is the place that started it all.",0
"Yes, this is the restaurant with the best soup dumplings. But if you want vegetarian fare, this probably isn't the best Chinatown has to offer.  Do not be fooled by the name Crab dumplings: that's a pork dumpling with crab included.

From what I can tell the few times I've been here, the Dim Sum makes Joe's a staple in Chinatown.  However, even meat eaters don't seem to get as much outside of the dumplings.  Unless you're looking for something in particular, I'd score your sesame chicken somewhere else and save the money.

I must admit this place is great for groups, espcially our families visiting from out of town.  Otherwise you have plenty of other places to choose in Chinatown.",0
"The good: Went around 3pm on a Thursday, and there was no wait.  The filling was tasty and the soup inside was plentiful.  Service was fast and very efficient. 

The bad: The skin was WAY too thick and chewy, and the xiao long bao were too big to eat conveniently in a single bite.  They are easily 50% bigger than Din Tai Fung's, which are the perfect size.  The hot and sour soup was completely flavorless and tasted Americanized (just straight up sour).

Overall: It's worth a visit and will hit your soup dumpling craving.  In fact, if I had never had DTF before, I'd probably think these are great.  However, if you have been spoiled by better, than make sure you lower your expectations when you walk into JS.",0
We went because of the high number of reviews but failed to see whats so great about it. They will make you share the table with a random party to fit in more customers. Food was strictly ok. We had ordered crab dumplings and kung pao chicken. There are definitely better chinese food places out there.,0
"If you ever find yourself at Joe's Shanghai, you MUST try the soup dumplings.  It's what they're known for, and by far, the best item on their menu.  Be careful when eating though, as the soup is hot and the dumplings puncture easily, which can spill soup everywhere if you're not careful.

That being said, the rest of their food is mediocre, like any average Chinese restaurant, which is the main reason why this review only got 3-stars.  

We sampled an array of other items on their menu, from pea shoots to noodle dishes, but its clear that we would only be coming back for the soup dumplings.

 Tips:  Don't leave tip - there's already 15% added to your bill, a little high for mediocre service.  Also, if its dinnertime, you should be prepared to wait half-an-hour or so.",0
"Probably the worst Shanghainese food I've ever had.  I was never impressed back in its original location but I don't remember it ever tasting this bad. 

Oily, bland and tasteless. No name dumps without the recognition JS has tastes better.",0
"Don't get the hype.  Neither I, nor my Chinese friend, enjoyed our meal.  Just OK food in a loud, busy place.",0
"Scary - I ordered from here for lunch today. There was a sharp piece of metal coming out of a piece of general tso's chicken. Totally shocking and unbelievably unsafe.

I was enjoying the dumplings before finding the metal in my food, but as you'd imagine I threw the rest of the food out. Would never visit or order from here again.",0
"I don't understand why there are so many raving reviews when you could get similar soup dumplings elsewhere or even at their own chain restaurants on 56th street or 37th avenue where there is probably better service. In all honesty, I come solely for their soup dumplings but, it can get boring. Unfortunately, whenever I decide to venture off into other foods on their menu, I am disappointed. 

If you want to try their soup dumplings, then come here. They offer either crab pork or pork dumplings in a stacked bamboo container straight from the stove. Always piping fresh. It is best eaten with some soy sauce, vinegar, and ginger. It gives the pork a fresher stronger flavor. Make sure to use your spoon to catch the soup when picking up the dumplings! 

Now if you want to try other foods, I recommend other restaurants. Their portions are small for the amount they charge and their service is atrocious. To be tightly seated with other strangers is honestly unappetizing and with all the cash they make under the table while evading taxes, they could use a renovation. At least their bathrooms. Even their waiters could use some etiquette lessons.

I would only come back to entertain friends who insist on trying out this infamous soup dumpling restaurant.",0
"Finally departed their old world location on Pell but surviving on their reputation from 30 yrs ago.  Shanghai Deluxe & Green Bo offer more authentic Shanghai cuisine. Tops Nan Xiang in Flushing offers casual cuisine as up-to-date as in SHA & HK. 

Nan Xiang is expanding beyond Flushing.  There is now a location on 33rd St between K'town & Empire State Bldg - nice modern operation, serving many Shanghai casual cuisine items. 
Pinch in Soho, offers quality Shanghai menu at a higher price point.  
Din Tai Fung to open in Midtown.",0
"They moved the original Joe's Shanghai to a new location so I wanted to give it a try. During dinner time, the wait was long so I decided to order take out. (wait is like 1.5 to 2 hours, I don't recommend the wait unless hour are a tourist.) I called the restaurant and it took them 40 minutes to prepare my food for takeout.

I order the the pork and crab soup dumplings. I do not recommend ordering those for takeout bechasw they stuff them in a takeout box, the dumplings get stuff together and when you go to eat it, the soup falls out. It ruins the soup dumplings. 

I also ordered the fried rice, beef rice cake and beef soup noodles. They were pretty good for takeout.

Overall, a good soup dumpling spot but not worth the wait because there are other soup dumping just as good around the corner. They need to have better soup dumpling takeout box to not ruin the soup dumplings takeout experience. Please also bring cash, the still do not accept cash.",0
"I came to Joe's Shanghai when I was in New York on vacation, and one of my friends insisted we go here for the best soup dumplings ever.  Maybe I shouldn't have gotten my expectations up, but I did, and when I bit into it I was pretty disappointed.  I never thought the soup dumplings at Din Tai Fung were anything that special until I ate this one.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't make me want to eat more of them.  The meat chunk inside was a bit too large, and the soup was a bit oily.  The flavor was a bit too pungent and pretty heavy.  Also our other dishes weren't that great.  We had the eggplant which was good, but I don't like when eggplant gets so soft it's unrecognizable as eggplant, and our pork/beef dishes (I don't even remember which one they were that unmemorable) were just so-so.  Overall I was pretty disappointed.  However, it was very cheap so that is a plus.",0
"Joe Shanghai's used to be the reigning king of soup dumplings,  but not anymore.  This week I've tried two different soup dumplings from this restaurant and Nan Shian (Flushing).   I have to admit the soup dumpling was so much more superior at Nan Shian.  

I also tried their Shanghai noodles, good, but quite greasy.   Good stuff, but it's just A-OK.",0
"I went with two friends and waited an hour sat afternoon to get a shared table. We ordered the pork dumplings which were the best dish. Crispy skin duck was not good at all,only tasted the game duck taste and salt. Fried pork chops were very heavy with oil soaked crust. Cold sesame noodles looked good but tasted only of peanut butter.

Is this a hyped restaurant or not? Do not waste your time or money there. Oh,btw most tourist and few Chinese were there, is this a sign or what?

 I am Chinese from San Francisco and have been to NYC many times and have yet to find a decent restaurant that serves good Chinese tasting food.  What is wrong with the Chinese food there? I have had great food all over NYC ,but never good or even passable food in Chinatown. You Chinese chefs and restaurants should be ashamed.  Come to San Francisco and taste what you should be cooking. 

Very disappointed customer",0
"I came here with high hopes! I was slightly disappointed, but it was pretty tasty. Does not compare to Din Tai Fung in Los Angeles or abroad. The soup and pork was good, but I didn't like the texture of the dumpling. Also they are too big! A smaller dumpling that fits nicely in the spoon is much better. I'm glad I tried out this hotspot, but I won't be going back for seconds.",0
The xiao long bao are good. Not better or worse than Shanghai Cafe on 100 Mott st but twice the price. Portions are very small. Mostly for tourists. Would not come here again given how close Shanghai Cafe is. If I wanted the best soup dumplings in New York I would go to Nan Xiang Dumpling House in Flushing.,0
"Joe's Shanghai used to be great many many years ago. However, the quality of the food just gone down way too much. Even a tourist would questioned and asked me if this is how it always tasted like. All I can say is this is not how it used to be. Don't waste your money next time to come into this tourist traps place! The carpet smell like bathroom in their dinning room. Everything is just old and dirty, the food taste either too salty or flavorless. Their service is horrible! Plus they would automatic added tip on your bill without telling you and ask for leaving tip. So we would leave cash tip on the table and without knowing the tip has already been included in the bill! This is so wrong!",0
"Pretty good but not worth it if it is a long line. We went on a weekday and the wait was about 15mins. Service is mediocre, typical Asian restaurant.",0
"I've been wanting to try this place for years and was able to get dinner with my family when we were all in NYC for the weekend. Even at 10 PM on Saturday night there very packed. We had to wait for a table for 6 of us. They have communal tables mostly so be prepared to sit and eat with strangers if you have a small group. 

Of course our waiter was rude. We were seated at 1015 PM and told us to hurry and order before the kitchen closes. So my family scrambles to order soup dumplings, shrimp fried rice, beef crispy noodles, and crispy duck. Soup dumplings are what they known for and it's good but not that good to put up with bad service. The beef crispy noodles were so salty. The crispy duck and fried rice were good though. It's nice that they give you oranges for dessert at the end. I was not a fan of their pricing either... charging almost $18 for sesame chicken. I'm glad I got to try it but I won't be back. 

Beware... cash only.",0
"My experience here was comical at best. The service was so bad that it was funny haha.  Good thing was that we were seated right away (came at about 4 pm on a weekday), but the server also wanted to take our order right away (can I at least open the menu first?!!?) what had us cracking up was that ... I don't know If it's all menus or just ours .. Was that the most frequently ordered items (ie the soup dumplings) were already circled in the menu! So he kept pointing to those saying.. ""Ok 2 order ok?"" Haha.. I asked him if we could have a second to look at the menu.. And he basically used a scare tactic on us by telling us that they take 15 mins to make!! Needless to say it worked and we went ahead and ordered the pork soup dumplings (since he was right.. That is exactly what we came for ) Much to our surprise the dumplings came in about 5 minutes! (What happened to the 15 minutes ?!) hehe.  Dumplings were definitely tasty... Good thing we were laughing the whole time since we barely noticed the severs watching over us like Hawks so that they could take our plates as soon as we put our spoons down haha. This time to no ones surprise we got our bill instantaneously.. Ok ok you want us out!! 

Now I know why they already add tip ;) 

To make a long story short: 
Cash only 
Prepare to be rushed 
Gratuity included in the bill 
Come around 4 pm to avoid a wait!",0
"Came here twice with friends for dinner and the food was good but i think it's a bit overrated. got the soup dumplings both times and both times they weren't very juicy, like the soup had dried up already or something. it was rather disappointing seeing as how this is what Joe's Shanghai seems to be known for. 

the atmosphere was boisterous and loud and good for a fun, casual dinner with a friend(s). 

the andwere both pretty good and both my friend and i were both rather pleased at how much meat was in the . 

the waiters here always seems to be too busy and it was hard to flag them down for water or our check even though there were several just standing around towards the end of the night when it wasn't even that busy. 

overall the food is decent but i think it's over-hyped because of how touristy it is. i would come here for the sake of bringing a friend to the famous Joe's Shanghai's, but would probably normally avoid it.",0
"Recommend: AVOID THIS PLACE

MEHhhh...DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. I have been coming to joes for the past two years and this last experience is my last and final visit. After venturing NYC Chinatown scene and trying out a number of Chinese restaurants, specifically serving soup dumplings,  joes quality of dumplings are now near the bottom of my list. The pan fried noodles are also not what they used to be. 

The service has always been bad, even at Chinese food restaurant standards. Ok, I get it, you want to be ""Authentic"" by treating non-Chinese patrons rude. But seriously, this last visit was the worst. After we sat, we were rushed to place an order even though the place was half empty. The food came out and tossed onto the table with no mind to placement. Had to ask several times for utensils and napkins. Water boy came out with fingers ""in the glass"" as he was trying to hold too many glasses at once...Yuck! We were rushed to pay the bill and as they were closing asked to get up and leave. There were still several other people still eating so with the effin rush? Bye Joe's... your staff is RUDE AF and give Chinese restaurants a bad rap.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is known for their xiaolongbao. That's really the only thing you should get here, the other food leaves something to be desired. Everything else we got seemed a bit too salty for my tastes, especially the string beans - and Chinese style string beans is something I love!

Xiaolongbao are decent but not the best I've had. They're more juicy here than other places so do yourself a favor and put the bao into your spoon before trying to eat it. Otherwise, you'll end up with a hot liquidy mess on the table and maybe on you as well. The crab ones are better than the pork ones.

In true Chinese style, you may have to share a crowded table with other people. That may be weird for some, but lots of places in Chinatown do it, especially really crowded, popular places like Joe's.",0
"After hearing so much about this place, I've decided to give this place a try.

First off this place was PACKED with tourists, making the wait almost an hour just for 2 people. We also had to share a table with another group of 5, who seemed discontent with havinig to share a table with strangers. By the end of our meal it turned out that they were expecting another 2 people to join their party but didn't inform the server beforehand (could've just said so from the start instead of making us feel uncomfortable). This already irritated me and my friend from the start.

Onwards to the food. We ordered the pork soup dumplings cause DUH, that's what you do at Joe's Shanghai, along with some spring rolls, scallion pancakes, and the Singapore Chow Mei Fun. The noodles were awful, and had a weird taste compared to the usual singapore noodles. We barely ate any of it and defiinitely did not want it to go. The scallion pancakes were pretty good and spring rolls were okay. The soup dumplings were ""meh."" They were decent, super oily and the meat wasn't as good as other soup dumplings that i've had. It definitely did NOT live up to the hype. They were just o-kay. I was very disappointed.

I would say try it once just to go, but for the wait time and the crowdedness, not worth it.",0
"Been wanting to eat here for a long time but everytime we came there was a long wait and so we'd go elsewhere. This time we hung in about 20 minutes. I should mention that we could've sat right away if we were wiling to sit at a round table with a bunch of strangers. But we looked at her like she was crazy and said, 'Absolutely not. We want our own table'. And so, we eventually got one and it was much better than sitting with ppl you don't know. That would've ruined the experience for me. I must say that the hostess had a bit of an attitude when we made it clear we would not be sitting with others. Anyway, on to the food. We ordered the soup dumplings because that's what they're famous for. Ehh. They were ok, nothing out of this world. Personally, I don't get it. We also ordered the Young Chow rice that comes with shrimp and were very disappointed to see the shrimp had not been cleaned. I'm sorry but that's a deal breaker. I don't like seeing that black vein in my shrimp. My friend ordered the melon soup. I thought that was crazy but he said he'd had it before. When it arrived I tasted some and it tasted like dirty sock broth, no lie. I said I told you not to order that. Some ppl never listen. We ordered the Beef with Bean Curd as an entree and it was spicy and good, just not great. It was also a little overpriced for such mediocre food. I would've given them a 3 if not for the lousy service. Our waiter was very condescending. Maybe some ppl get off on being treated like crap but when I'm already being fleeced for overhyped food, I don't appreciate mistreatment on top of it. I wouldn't go back. Once was more than enough. I'm sure Chinatown has much better places to eat.",0
"O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D.

This was not a pleasant dining experience.  It wasn't worth the 1.5 hour wait outside, and wasn't worth getting jammed in.  

Nice of the waiter to sit me down, thrust a menu in my face a split second my ass hits the seat and demand to know ""how many?""  No, I'm not some uppity foodie who doesn't get it - I happen to be Chinese and fully understand how ghetto Chinese restaurants can get.  

Their soup dumplings were indeed good, but I've had better.  If you're ever in Chicago try the xiao long bao at Moon Palace in Chinatown on Cermak next to the fire station.  Much, much better and none of the hassle.",0
Food is OK. Service rude and indifferent always. Is it really that hard? There are better choices. No return for me.,0
"We enjoyed the pork dumplings, lo mien, and onion pancake. However, the half-hour wait in the street with the many cigarette smokers, and the cacophony inside at a communal table that was too big to engender conversation, makes this ""must experience"" into just another Chinese restaurant. Probably would be better during off hours, or after December when they change location.",0
"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Prepare for a long wait since it's super crowded here after work or weekends.  They will give you a number and call it out frequently just to make sure you're still around.  We waited almost 45 minutes for a table.  When you're seated, make sure to order xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) as soon as possible since it does take some time to make.  I do like their crab/pork and pork soup dumplings since they're big, have a lot of meat/soup in each one, and the soup is very tasty.  Everything else is not very memorable - ordered the flounder, braised string beans, pan fried noodles, pork chops, and scallion pancakes.  I feel like I could better Chinese food elsewhere but the soup dumplings are pretty good.  However, I don't know if they're worth the long wait though.",0
"Still good, one year later.  However, I gotta say...after my XLB excursion in Shanghai...I found these to be a little bit too big (what??!) and not as delicate as the XLB I devoured in China.  Also, as much as I love the idea of communal dining...I don't like it forced upon me.   Wow, did that sound snobby... But in reality - the broth is fantastic, but the filing isn't.  We ate at 5pm and thanks goodness - by the time we left, there was a line out the door.",0
"Food was ""picked up"" and ""delivered"" within 1 minute. Unless my driver is Nightcrawler from X-men, there's just no way this is possible. Restaurant blamed everything on Doordash and refused to send their own delivery man. What a joke. As long as you still have problematic door dash as one of your delivery options, expect to get horrible reviews.",0
"I had always been told that Joe's Shanghai has the best soup dumplings in New York, so I guess I had pretty high expectations going in. I'm writing a belated review, so maybe this place has improved from the last time I was there, but honestly I was not super impressed. 

I got a portion of the pork soup dumplings, which were good, and the prices are fair, but the service was just so so. I felt like the server was in a hurry, and the place wasn't packed. Maybe it's just the way they are conditioned because it's generally crowded, but quite unnecessary.

I'd recommend you go so you can taste and see for yourself, but there are other places where you can have soup dumplings that are just as good as or better than they were here.",0
"Do not come here if you want XLB 
Or if you already had XLB before & looking for a fix 

It's completely white washed with tourist 

They alter it to meet the westernized taste and texture 

I dont know how they got an award lol",0
"Great food, but it's a really unpleasant experience... Way too many people, way too much noise.",0
We ordered a bunch of food but everything besides the soup dumplings were disappointing. 烤麸 was okay. Soup dumplings were great. Shanghai stir fried noodles were so so. Braised pork with pickles was very disappointing - full of soy sauce and nothing else. Not flavorful and weirdly sweet. Service was bad the servers ignored us several times and when I asked about their specialties and recommendations the guy seemed very annoyed and impatient. Well they don't do tips maybe that's the cause but I would still expect any servers to be kind to customers.,0
"I came here on a Thursday night for a family dinner - we had 8 people and were seated fairly quickly (which was basically the ONLY saving grace of the night.) 

1- Because the tables are set for 10, they forced us to share a table with an unfortunate duo AFTER we were seated (so we were not given the option to change our minds and go elsewhere because we were already seated.) It was unfortunate for the couple on a date, having to share with all of us. 
2- because the table was set up with a lazy susan, the duo was forced to crowd all their dishes in the little space on the table between them because otherwise their food would be mixed in with ours. 
3- the food came quickly but all the stirfried dishes looked and tasted the same - and were essentially thrown on the table rather than placed down and explained. 
4- the staff was brusque and rushed, shoving in between us to place dishes without warning. 
5- the space was so loud, it was impossible to hear across the table. this was not helped by the staff shouting loudly across the room. 
6- they skimped on the lettuce layer underneath the soup dumplings, meaning EVERY SINGLE DUMPLING busted open when picked up. 

we couldn't get out of there fast enough and we're definitely never coming back. There are better alternatives in the area - Joe's Ginger up the street and Shanghai Manor on Mott street.",0
"alright, i don't know why there's such big hypes about this place. i was expect something authentic like in Asia.. but it was more Americanized... bigger in size and doesn't taste as delicate in flavors. the dumpling wrapper/skin tasted rough not as soft or smooth. The filling was okay. maybe all the hypes made me expect a lot. but to me it doesn't taste as good as the ones I had in Asia for sure. it was kind of disappointing. Good thing we didn't wait for too long. there were 3 of us, so we shared a big table with 2 other groups. my first time seeing that in NYC.",0
"As average as it gets, what's with the hype?  The highlight was suppose to be the crab dumplings and even that was just average.  The rest of the food was greasy Chinese food, that had tons of MSG to it.  The seating is horrible, they sat us down in a large shared table, and we were blown to icecube with the horrible A/C vent above us.  The food got cold as soon as it hit the table.  Sorry not going back, there's gotta be better Chinese food that Joe's in New York right, very disappointing.",0
"They treat their customers like crap.  The waiters are over-worked, cranky and often unresponsive to even a modest request.l (I had to ask 3 times before I could get a glass of water. ) When my food came, it was plopped down on the communal table three feet away from me.

The mandatory tip on ALL checks is smack in the face.",0
"soup dumplings are good. and cheap. the other items like the scallion pancake... not bad. it is good, but i've had better! 3.5",0
"Came here for the soup dumplings. Got mapo tofu, eggplant, and rice wine dumplings too.

The soup dumplings (we got pork and crab) were okay. I've had better (though I've also been to Shanghai, so maybe my standards are out of wack)

Mapo tofu, eggplant, meh. Rice wine dumplings were the worst I've ever had.

I was definitely underwhelmed. And they didn't even have good service to make up for it.",0
"Xiao Long Bao, as described by many, will be the best in this place in NYC. Don't get all into the hype about being the BEST, it's just pretty good place in NYC. The food is judged by its soup, the stuffing, and the skin. How it's made is a whole different thing. 

The rest of the food is just there to please others who want to try other things.  Yes, it's definitely a tourist trap, but it's all good. 

Very hectic busy place. You'll be seated with other people, sharing the table 50% of the time. 

There's almost always a wait outside. 

Why 3 stars:
1) Xiao Long Bao is good..the rest is ehh. 
2) Sharing tables. Ehh, they do it in most asian restaurants, but I still don't like it. 
3) Waiters will serve you, but they're not over the top caring for you. Attitude's like ""Eat well & happy, but get out when you're done. We have others. Please don't linger. I'm underpaid and over worked with stupid tourists"". It's understandable. 
4) A charge of 15%?! Yes, it's the standard, it'll solve my math, and efficient, but I still don't like it being placed on there.",0
Interesting spot for some delicious food! Had the pork steam buns and they were very good. Nothing incredibly special but enjoyable nonetheless. Service was fast but be aware that they take cash only at this location. Overall good food for decent prices!,0
"for the hype that was around this joint i was expecting punch in my face type of meal.  and explosion of flavor in my mouth.  but i was a bit disappointed.  the only thing memorable there was the soup dumplings and dont get me wrong, they were quite tasty.  outside of that, the food was so-so.  food was either salty or bland.  the meal didnt really seem to fit.  and for china town food this place is pretty expensive.  i definitely recommend you hitting up shanghai cafe.  much better spot.",0
"I'm not usually a fan of Chinese food, but this was the best I've had. I probably wouldn't pick this place out of all the amazing restaurants in Manhattan, but if you are in the area and love Chinese food, definitely stop by! You'll love it if you don't mind the other things I'll mention.

4 stars for the food, knock one off for everything else. 

The wait was horrific. Some customers were served first for the same items even though they arrived later than us, one person in our group was served a half hour or so before the rest. 

Also, the waiters were very hard to understand, they really rush you to order, and aren't very attentive, but that's to be expected for such a busy place in China town. 

Beware! The portions are very big. 2-3 people could share each $15 dollar entree, but it's meant to be that way.

The food was much better than expected, especially for the price. The dumplings seemed to be very popular, almost every table had them! Worth a try. 

This would be a 4-5 star for Chinese food lovers, but if you are just looking for a place to eat in NYC, service makes it a 3.",0
"I've been to the Midtown Joe's location dozens of times; it's more expensive and you get fewer dumplings per tray, but the service goes above and beyond what I experienced tonight. On top of that, I became violently ill no more than an hour after leaving the Chinatown location.

We ordered three trays of dumplings, half of which were broken open by the time we were served--dried out and sticky by the time we ate them. Plus one star for the shredded beef special, which was decent. 

Cash only and family-style seating.",0
"Meh
- Soup Dumplings
- Singaporean style noodles

It was pretty cool coming to an institution like this. The skin is a little thick and I wasn't  a huge fan of the crab/pork ones. There wasn't too bad of a wait and it was cool sharing a table with random folks. Really good service but the food didn't hold up. Din Tai Fung is absolutely a beast compared to this.",0
"So I feel the odd man out here, but Joe's is just okay.  Finally, came down for lunch to try the famous Joe's Shanghai.  Firstly, if you go for lunch for a party of 2- there is no wait.  Though, there was considerably a much longer wait when we left around 2 pm.   I'd say everything to be said about the service is true-- serious lack thereof.   I mean, I'd expected as much from Chinatown but surprisingly my boyfriend was pretty uppity about the lack of service.  The waiter didn't respond, took a long time, didn't bring up anything at the same time, etc.  Normally, I wouldn't care but Joe's Shanghai tries to portray itself as a much better, American friendly, cleaner, Chinese restaurant with its touristy lure (ugly polos are for sale).  The service was truly Chinatown and budget- as least to us. 


Onto the food.  The soup dumplings (in the appetizer section, called the Pork Buns)- good.  I went to a place in Flushing that was better.  Too bad I can't remember the name (next time, I will , I promise!)  The skin of the dumpling was a bit dough-y and thick for my taste but I guess you need that to hold on to the soup.  The meat- a good size, but too salty. I ended up passing it along to my boyfriend to eat.  The best part?  The broth.  The broth did have a lot of flavor, but it's too bad the rest of the dumpling mildly added up. There's a good quantity for the price though- I think it was like $6ish for 8 soup dumplings.

The rest of the food?  Good. I, again, ate with my eyes and over ordered.  The dishes are pretty big here.  We ordered the shredded turnip cake as another appetizer, and this I was a HUGE fan of. Liked the sourness of the shredded turnip mixed it with the fried batter, it was a little greasy but understandably so- not too greasy.  It went well with the dumpling sauce.  As a main, my boyfriend had the beef tenderloin pho type of soup- sadly I don't eat beef so I can't comment but he said the noodles were perfect, and broth flavorful. 

I had the diced chicken with cucumbers, which embarrassingly I thought was going to be kung pao chicken. It wasn't bad-- the chicken was good. It could have been spicier but I liked the texture- the worst is when chicken gets that soft bone texture; there was none of that here.  I also thought that the cucumbers were nice because they weren't overly cooked,  I'd like to think it was a healthy dish, which made me feel good.  Pile that on with a bowl of (stale) white rice, and you'll be STUFFED.  Be forewarned- don't eat with your eyes!

In the end, I think I left on only a lukewarm note mainly because this place is so expensive for Chinatown.  Turnip cake, soup dumpling, pho and diced chicken, came out to $35; which more than Chinatown's average price.  Thus, I wasn't down for that.  I'm glad I came down to try it but I don't think I feel propelled enough to go back.",0
"Extremely rude service. The awful experience started when we requested a number in the waitlist. I asked about the estimated waiting time. The woman at the front desk shouted ""I have told you the waiting time. Go back and look at your number!"" Don't come to this awful place!",0
"I am usually kind when i rate restaurants...but this place is just horrible...after hearing about this place on Zagat (when Yelp wasnt around then)..i had to come.....i am a #1 fan of Xiao Long Baos!!! 

Anyways.....because its ""so famous""...you find 25% locals and 75% tourist who are here.....I ordered Pork and Crab dumplings..and the crab dumplings were ok...but the pork dumpling tasted terrible..the inside was still pinkish...--medium rare in dumplings?..0_0 so i waved one of the waiters over....there seems to be like millions of them there...i dun even know why.....

And it still took a while for one of them to come over.....I told him that the pork dumplings doesnt seem to be cooked..and instead of replacing my dumplings....they just took it away and re-steamed it....and it was still pinkish afteward. I hate to have the waiters over again...because the one before was rude ...

So i ended up leaving 4 pieces of dumplings there.....and i felt so bad because i dont usually waste food.....sniff sniff!!!!

SHAME ON THEM! 

Service sucks, food is ok...Plus its freaken overrated!

On another note.....the Joe's Shanghai on 5th Ave....is so much better!! Better in Service and Food....!!",0
"BEWARE... Tourist Trap!!
Excited to try NYC's famous Xiaolongbao's, I went straight towards the place with the most reviews. Deep in Chinatown, I was confident this place would deliver. But when I looked around inside, there was not a single local. The xiaolongbaos were large, much bigger than the ones from Din Tai Fung. The wrapper was also noticeably thicker. The dumplings were decent but definitely not worth the hype. The leek pancakes on the hand were surprisingly good. They weren't particularly special, but they did taste better than the dumplings. Try another place for  xiaolongbaos!!!",0
"Soup dumplings = XLB.

I don't know what all the hype is about.  Sure, lots of soup broth but the tip of each dumpling is chewy.  This place was on sis's bucket list of eats so we came.

# 9 is the pork dumplings and #10 the crab ones.  Skip the crab ones.  Too seafood smell.

We ordered three other dishes.  All were good but not great. 

I don't think I would come back.   We've got great XLB back home.",0
"Let me save you the trouble. This is just a decent Chinese restaurant. If you're coming here to try the XLB's turn around and head to Kung Fu Kitchen instead. If you're just looking for a basic and slightly overpriced Chinese meal, you'll be fine. 

The XLB Analysis - 

Skin - The thing that stands out to me most on XLB's is the dough. I'm so confused by the endless DTF comparisons as the XLB's aren't even comparable. What makes DTF's XLB standout is the ability to get a really thin wrap. When your dough is thick, it makes the knot on top thick and chewy. If that's what you're looking for, then you'll be fine with Joe's XLBs. Personally, I think a thinner skin allows for the soup base to shine more.

Soup - Pretty flavorful, but unfortunately for Joe's I had Kung Fu Kitchen's one day before and the pork fat in Joe's just couldn't compare. Wasn't as juicy and rich. 

Meat - Solid, no complaints here. Pork is juicy and flavored well.

The rest of the food is fine. Pan fried noodles were delicious. Fried rice is seasoned well. Joe's is a reliable place for mid-tier Chinese food. Confused by the hype. Just because Manhattan doesn't have great Chinese food doesn't mean you should lower your standards.",0
Worse experience. Wait more than half an hour for the wonton soup. Can't freaking believe it,0
"Well we came here just for soup dumplings. And it was good. We got the pork soup dumplings and it was good, but not great. In addition, the place was PACKED, we were crammed like sardines...but at least the waiting time was within 5 minutes. Like typical Asian establishments, we were shown a table with people already eating. Classic.",0
"My husband and I stopped here for a quick snack because the reviews were so good, almost the best in the area. I'm not sure if it's because we had high hopes or just got a bad dish but we were not impressed. We ordered the chicken fried rice (to go, cash only) and couldn't believe the lack of flavor and scarcity of meat. The food was in desperate need of more seasoning and more salt. We came very hungry and left unsatisfied by the food we ordered. Also... cash only?? In New York?? Post Covid?? To be fair, there are ATMs in the restaurant.",0
"The only thing I love here is the soup dumplings. The skin is thin with good amount of meat/crab filling. I love that inside the dumpling has a good amount of soup. The soup is really flavorful. From all the places I've been to, this place has the thinnest skin with lots of soup.

If there's a long wait, I don't think it's worth it. I've tried other dishes here but they weren't that great. I would come here ONLY for the soup dumplings.",0
"Having lived in New York 15+ years, this place holds so many great memories. Fast forward to 2018 - it's steadily declined.  Now this isn't the place for an ambient dining experience but maintaining standards should count for something. 

Whether I carry out or dine in it shouldn't lack the minimal people skills that I've encountered more than usual and it's enough. My suggestion would be to brush up on your customer service skill set or find another purpose in the restaurant. The food saves you but it'll be while before I return. And I don't respond well to rudeness - so there's your forewarning.",0
"Pros:
Quick take-out. 
Scallion pancakes. 

Cons:
Greasy, 'made too far in advanced' tasting food. 
Canned mushrooms and imitation crab.
Requested vegetable spring rolls. Actual rolls had pork and shrimp.
Cash only.
Run down /tired space.

Tossed the leftovers. Sad I wasted one of my precious NY meals here.",0
The worst service I have ever seen. Soup dumpling was the only one I ordered bz it is a specialty of the restaurant. Never come back!,0
"My husband and I went to this restaurant because of all the reviews. We got the soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, General Tso chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, and Szechuan beef for takeout since they were too busy for dine-in. Food was about $100.

TIP: They only accept cash. They do have an ATM in the vestibule of the restaurant if you need it. 

I personally thought that the food was just okay. My favorite of all the food we ordered was the eggplant in garlic sauce.

Food was definitely overrated.",0
"The XLB were pretty good, but overall, it's not something to be impressed about. The chicken fried rice was okay, but the flat noodles were greasy. You can just taste the MSG. The service is bad too. (Cash only)",0
Place was packed.  Waited 45 minutes for a table for 4.  We came here for the Pork soup dumplings and they were just ok.  I've had better.  The rest of the dishes were just ok too.  Food came out one entree at a time and they forgot our Shrimp dish but Overall service was good.  Our server was nice and kept our drinks refilled.  Checked on us often.  Glad we tried it but will not return.,0
"BAD SERVICE!!!
We had a party of 9 and asked if we can have 2 bills for the table. The waiter rudely told us that we will have to move to 2 separate tables if we want 2 bills. NOT ACCOMMODATING!!!
The food was not all that great. 
The only good dish they have there were the dumplings.
The bill came with 18% gratuity already included.
That should not give them the right to treat the customers badly.  Base on their service. The gratuity should have been 5%. 
Upon leaving the restaurant, I spoke to the manger about the poor service and the rudeness of his staff. He offered NO apology.
It is apparent why the staff is so unprofessional and rude. Leadership should start from the top down.
You will NEVER see me here again!",0
"Outdoor seating widely available right outside the store. Indoor restroom available for use. No indoor seating. 
Food was good and decent price for chinatown. 
Soup dumplings were slightly salty, but nice and soupy! Chicken had bones in it, just FYI. Chicken did not taste special, just fried chicken with some scallions sprinkled on top. Scallion pancakes were pretty soggy in the to-go container, but basic flavor. 
Would go again to try different items on the menu. 
Also, cash only!",0
"Decent food, not so great service. To start with the positives, the food was good. They are well known for their soup dumplings. There are two options to choose from the pork or crabmeat. We ordered the pork soup dumpling and was fairly impressed. We also ordered the crispy shredded beef and a duck dish. Both were good but not out of this world amazing. I'm pretty thrown off with the service. We went on a Monday night, it was somewhat busy and the server decided to seat us in a shared table even though there were clearly open tables available. It also seemed that our server's favorite response to every question we asked that night was a ""no""! They managed to mess up our bill in which they combined our total with the other people we shared the table with. I'm not sure if this was an off night for them since I see a lot of the rave reviews but I wasn't impressed. Luckily there are other locations in NYC (Flushing and Midtown). I'm willing to give it another go, just not at this location.",0
"Joe's Shanghai sucks.
I used to love it but it was so bad I was really embarrassed to have taken my cousins there last night.
Really, really, really rude waiters - kept trying to take our food before we were finished eating, insisted on keeping the check in the tray when I needed to hold it so my cousins wouldn't try to pay.
The only flavor in the food was salt.
  Seriously, in something called Crispy Pepper skin duck you should be able to expect a little pepper.

Only the soup buns were okay.",0
"Sanitation was rated a C at the front door and it seems like its reflected on the food. I just shared one order of Pork XLB which comes with 8 pieces. It was not bad but it did have a ""fishy"" taste to it as my friends described it as. We didn't understand why as it should only have pork in it. I definitely wouldn't say this is the best place to get XLB, as there are better places like shanghai Asian manor, the Bao, etc. I wouldn't say this was a horrible place either. 

The only thing is that this place gives 8 pieces for ~$6. Normally you'll find places giving 4-6 for ~$6. Service was good and getting seated during the afternoon was quick. There's auto gratuity of 15%. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but maybe if I was nearby.",0
Not impressed. I guess that's why we are spoiled with good Chinese food on the west coast.   There are much better Chinese food options in New York Chinatown.,0
"Everything was good but nothing to rave over. Apparently this place draws in a huge amount of foot traffic and we just happen to go through on a snowy weekday so seating was a cinch. Crispy duck was crispy, the soupy dumplings were strange but pretty good, and the green onion pancake was fluffy. Recommended by several frequent NYC visitors and I now know why but my next visit might only be if I happen to be by Chinatown.",0
"Solid food but overrated and not particularly worth waiting for. I went with a group of 8 and we waited 20-30 minutes since it was on a weekday and snowing outside. I've tried to go a few times before and the wait would always be 1-1.5 hours. If I even tried to wait that long, I'd end up walking around Chinatown and eating my fill at other places for half the price.

Pros:
- Lots of soup in the pork dumplings! They were yummy but fell apart rather easily. 
- Scallion pancakes were delicious.
- Portions for other entrees are massive. We were way too ambitious when ordering and didn't finish 1/3rd of the food.
- Decently clean bathroom! A rare find in Chinatown.

Cons:
- Long wait. Your whole group has to be there when called otherwise they'll skip onto the next.

Tips:
- Cash only.
- Definitely get the pork dumplings over crab.",0
"Have you guys been to Ninja NYC? It's an overpriced restaurant where real life ninjas serve and cook you food and demonstrate ninjutsu skills that put Naruto to shame.

I didn't know they had a training camp here at Joe's Shanghai, where waiters literally shuriken-tossed shit on your table. Plates were literally thrown down, almost knocking over our tea cups. The way my dad smacked my 64/100 math exam down on my desk was gentler than that shit.  Dishes were served and placed at our blind spot (""uh... so does that belong to us or the other party sitting at our table?"") It was a race to see how fast they could service our table and masterfully withdraw to the sideline where they just stood and looked pretty (they weren't.) You can put Paris Hilton behind the counter in a McDonalds and she'd provide you with warmer service. As we stood up to leave, the host lady gave a very nonchalant ""thank you bye"" without even looking at me. No smiles whatsoever; it was as if Kim Jong Un himself would come conscript them if any friendliness was shown towards Western devils.

Food was standard and overpriced. The soup dumplings were in line with what Joe's Shanghai usually produces, which is pretty good. The double cooked pork looked nothing like double cooked pork and tasted salty like hell. I had to call a waiter and ask him to confirm if that's what we ordered.

Tea was lukewarm when we sat down.

Get your shit together Joe's. I've had better... say, your Flushing branch? 

15% gratuity is included. I am not sure whether that's because
a) They knew nobody would be sane to tip more than 15% for their shit service anyway or
b) They were afraid people would just not tip at all. 

Jando S is pretty spot on. I'd avoid.",0
"""What the eff are soup dumplings?"" was exactly what I thought when my friend said that we were going to spend the first meal of my 4th of July vacation at Joe's Shanghai. When we arrived we placed ourselves on a long list of patrons waiting to be seated. We then waited on the curb with all the other hungry patrons and when they finally called our number, they herded us into the crowded restaurant with everyone else waiting and proceeded to seat us at a table already occupied by a family of tourists. Wonderful.

The soup dumplings were delicious. The broth in the dumplings was not too salty, but full of flavor. The meat (we got beef) tasted just like the meat filling in siomai. DELICIOUS. Our entree was like any other dish in a chinese restaurant and quite frankly not worth writing about. The service just stinks at Joe Shanghai. I mean 1. why do they call everyone on the wait list at exactly the same time? 2. how the hell am i supposed to enjoy my meal with a family watching me stuff my face? 3. the waiter gave me the stink eye when I tried to order a beer 4. the waiter(s) tried to rush us out before we even got our entree.

If I could sit in front of my t.v. with a tub filled with soup dumplings, I would. Unfortunately the sad reality is I can't. And so with great regret, I give Joe's Shanghai 3 stars. Not because the soup dumplings weren't everything my stomach expected (and more!), but because the service sucked. If you can, get your dumplings to go ...",0
"I had meals at this restaurant's Chinatown and Mid Town places.  Xiao Long Bao was average at Mid Town but was 1 star at Chinatown.  The ones at Chinatown were discolored and looked like the basket was waiting for order for over 30 minutes.

Shanghai Fried Noodle was sufficient taste but greasy.

Radish Pastry 蘿蔔絲酥 was completely tasteless.  Very bland with no taste of radish or much else.

I think this restaurant is overhyped by reviewers who are not knowledgeable of Shanghai cuisine.  Both restaurants had almost no locals dining.",0
"Good food, scallion pancake, pork dumplings, orange beef, beef flat noodles But the service is Horrible! What a shame! The waiter was none attentive and rude. They literally throw the plate on the table and runway . Oh and 15% tip automatically included and they only take cash! If you're a foodie who likes good service, spend your money somewhere else.",0
"I've been to the original location more than 10 years ago and that was the first time I've ever had Xioa Long Bao. I knew this place was famous and wanted to try it again. Luckily for me, I didn't have to wait too long for a table for 1. Normally, you do have to wait. Since it was just me I could only order 1 dish and that was their Xio Long Bao. The portion sizes are HUGE! This can feed a family of 4. Let's just say people that come to Joe's are usually a bigger group. Therefore, this dish is suited for a large group. 1 person was too much and because it was huge I couldn't try anything else in the menu. The dumplings are really soupy and they are generous with the meat. You are also paying for it too because a basket of the dumplings aren't cheap.

In general, 1 dumpling was already popped and the soup spilled on the basket. (hence the picture) Therefore, I am disappointed in the presentation. Also, heads up there is an automatic 18% gratuity.",0
"came here for the famous soup dumplings which were okay. i've definitely had better but these weren't so bad. Got the pork and crab dumpling and just the pork dumpling. the crab dumpling is a little bit fishy for my taste.

the staff was friendly and we had really good service.",0
"Wow!  

The service was absolutely atrocious...in a kinda ""in your face"" way. 

Waiters -

1. Rushed us to order
2. Rudely plopped food down on our table 
3. Only refilled teapot and water after we flagged them down
4. Kept reaching to take our plates away even though we weren't done, leaving us to reach for the remaining portions as the plates were hoisted in the air. 
5. Dropped check on table even though we didn't request yet. 

Things to know:
1. Could have shared table seatings since mostly large tables. 
2. 15% tip added to check 
3. No reservations which means won't seat you until all present. 
4. Cash only. 

Frankly, I don't care how good the soup dumplings are.  When the service is this poor, respect yourself and go elsewhere. 

Where I'm coming from -  born in NY, Chinatown native...believe me when I say there are better alternatives. I've been here 3 times, and disliked every single time. Each time because out of towner friends wanted to try, and I aimed to accommodate. I'm stronger and tougher these days and will now point others in another direction when this restaurant is brought up.",0
"Joe's is a classic Chinatown staple that is increasingly overrun by the tourist crowd. Lines are long - you can end up waiting over an hour on weekends - and while they have recently renovated the place, the seating is still not very comfortable.

The food is still uniformly good, there are no 'bad' dishes but also nothing that seems particularly outstanding or special. The soup dumplings are a must-try. I find the exterior of the dumplings are a little thicker than some of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants. 

The servers are definitely overworked during peak times so it's hard to expect great service. Note for first timers, you may have to share a table with other patrons. The restaurant is cash only and an 18% tip is included in your bill.",0
Not a real Chinese food at all!! I can't believe there were so many people on waiting line!,0
"We decided to go here based on the amount of reviews this place had on Yelp. It's in Chinatown in an alley so it does look sketchy if you don't know where you're going. We visited from Dallas and really wanted to have dim sum and what better place than Chinatown? It was much to my disappointment that this is more a traditional family style Chinese restaurant than a dim sum restaurant. That should definitely change on Yelp because it misled me to thinking there would be carts circling around me while I ate. 
We went on a Wednesday night and the wait for a big group of us was about 30 minutes. I would say expect a wait if you're going for lunch or dinner. It's a small restaurant and only one story. We walked around Chinatown during the wait since there isn't a wait area inside. You come in and it's what a Chinese restaurant should be like, a lot of hustling and bustling. The only thing on their menu that reminded me of dim sum was their famous soup dumplings. These take awhile to make so be sure to order as soon as you sit down if you want to try these. Like I said earlier, we didn't know it was family style so we each ordered a dish. We were a group of 9 girls. That being said, I wish they told it was family style because we were overwhelmed with food by the end of the night, which isn't a bad thing. We just felt bad because we were leaving the next day and our hotel didn't have a microwave so there was no point in bringing back the leftovers with us. 
My friends thoroughly enjoyed their foods but I didn't think it was too special. I got the braised beef noodle soup with bok choy. I only ate the beef because it was the only thing seasoned. But I did enjoy their soup dumplings! I wish I could have packed these things with me. It was super yummy and a decent size. The good thing was that everything was super cheap. The downside, if you're going in a big group, just split up the check on your own and have one person pay because accepted payment is only cash. 
Would I go again? Maybe, but only to gobble up the soup dumplings.",0
"This review is not for the food - we never got that far!
The fiance and I got here, and saw a crowd of people in the street waiting to be seated. I put my name down and got us a ticket ""#69"" woohoo! the high point of the evening! The lady at the front door told us it would be approximately 30 minutes before we got a table. We were there 20 minutes, then 30, then 45, and then we passed the 1 hour mark, checking in with the lady regularly. The last time we went back and talked to the lady, a full 30+ minutes after her estimated seat time, she just shrugged said ""I don't know"" and went back to chatting with her friend. 

Anyway, I'll be sure to be back with a good book and cleared schedule next time, cus I really have to try their fabled soup dumplings just once!",0
"It is an OK place.
The food, especially the xiao long bao are just average.
(There are so many other better places for xiao long bao couple of block away)

My non-Asian friends always do a big group dinner here during Christmas or New Years. So I do eat here occasionally.

What is all the buzz then? Crowds form outside in sub-zero degrees weather?
Their claim to fame is the old tourist guide and food guide books written by people who are not too kine to authentic food and only go with with the herd.

There use to be three Joe's Shanghai, Chinatown, Elmhurst Queens, and Flushing.
I think the Flushing location is the best of the three. 
The Elmhurst location have been closed for several years.

Go, enjoy yourselves at Joe's. It is good but not the best.",0
"How fun are soup dumplings?  Pretty freakin' fun!  I ordered out from here today and I really didn't know what to expect.  I thought the dumplings came in soup...but they are FILLED with soup... soo cool.  

We had to wait ten minutes for our pork/crab meat filled buns, so while we waited, we read the Time Out, City Search, etc articles in the restaurant window.  I loved the cartoon that explained HOW to eat a soup dumpling.  THANK GOD.  If I hadn't read that, my mouth would be scorched and I would be soo out of Yelp commission for like a week, at LEAST!  I

 had my spoon and chopstick, took a little nibble, sucked out the soup (garlicky and oddly thick!) and casually ate the rest of the dumpling.  I was happy that I got take out because I feel the walk back to work sort of cooled the dumplings down. 

Overall, if you're looking for dumplings, enjoy the experience, don't expect some magical spell to be cast on your tastebuds.  They were good but not like amazing...just more fun.   I have no other soup dumplings to compare them with but judging from the crowd and line, I can at least attest to the fact that they are fresh!",0
"Came with a friend and we were both hungry. We ordered the shredded beef, eggplant with garlic sauce with pork, crab meat soup dumplings, and turnip shortcakes. Overall I actually enjoyed the food, but was not very happy with my seating arrangement. We were asked if we would mind sharing a table with other people; I assumed that there would at least be some sort of divider between us and the other party. 
Instead, we got sat at a round table for 4. They tried to put another party of 4 at our table (so squeezing 6 people onto a 4 person table). But there was an empty 4 person table next to us so we just asked if they could be moved there. Eventually we got a pair of people sat at our table and there really was no separation between us. If you're willing to overlook this then definitely recommend going for the food.",0
"I went last night and the place is more hype that quality.   First the good:
Me and my partner split Pork Dumplings and Hot n Sour Soup.  The dumplings were good (I would give them a 4 *), we disagreed on the Hot n Sour soup.  I thought it was also 4 Stars, but my partner hated it, so let's make it 3 *.  
The rest of the meal was not good.  I had Double Cooked Pork.  It was very bland and had lots of tofu in big chunks in it.  N",0
"Food was good but way over priced!!!! Left hungry and still paid over $80 not including tip. Rice not included with the meal and was charged $2 for a tiny bowl of rice, got 5 small shrimp for $23.",0
"I was expecting the best... but its was an ok for me.. 

I've never heard of this place but my friends told me it was pretty popular and that it was delicious, in my opinion I thought it was ok. I had better. I feel like this restaurant caters to Americans, and me being Asian I have higher expectations for a place that serves Asian food, not saying it was the worse but it was just ok for me.

ALSO.. I hate the service here, I mean I know asian people are rude, but for a place thats so popular they need to learn some manners. Our waiter kept coming to the table to take stuff away, for example Im eating and he wants to reach across my plate to pick up the chopstick wrapper... like seriously can I finish taking my bite first.. 

I dont want to sound mean and make this place sound terrible but I wont be going back.",0
"I always love coming to this spot. The dumplings are definitely great but I am only giving a 3 stars because of the cleanliness. I alway thinks if the carpet is dirty and the tables are super clean that the kitchen maybe a little dirty too! Hmmm.. I only wonder. Anyways I do enjoy the fried beef with white rice. Even though it's not super healthy it's definitely delicious. Also, don't expect to sit by yourself as this is community seating. It's really fine for me but you can't really have a deep conversation bc I'm sure everyone else is listening at the table.",0
"Their xiaolongbao is good and their American Chinese food is decent. 

I wouldn't go for any authentic or Szechuan food. The more ""authentic"" food turns out to be super home style, and the Szechuan food becomes Americanized. 

For the brand, I feel like they could do better with the more authentic dishes, or just remove them from the menu if they don't think it fits. Also could be useful to have an American and Chinese menu separation.",0
"Let me preface that I am a pescatarian. That isn't the best fit for Chinese food. Especially a place that is authentic and specializes in soup which I doubt has a vegetarian base. (Never have visited China, I *think* this place is pretty authentic, but I can't say for 100% certainty.) 

Oh, and Joe's ONLY TAKES CASH. So come prepared.

Anyway, I get nervous eating at Chinese restaurants that aren't Americanized because I don't know what has pork or beef in it, even if its under the ""Vegetables"" section. So, my sis and I were in Chinatown and found Joe's Shanghai on Yelp and thought we'd give it a try. It was the middle of a weekday at lunch, so there was no wait to get in.

I ordered the Vegetable Pan Fried Noodles and she got the Pork Mu Shu. We sat at a round table with other guests and made good friends with the guy sitting next to us. My sis shared her Mu Shu with him, and she had some of his Kung Pao Chicken. They both loved their meals. Me? Not so much. 

The Noodles were sooooo greasy. When I bit into the noodles, I could feel the grease coating my mouth. The sauce was unbelievably greasy as well, and left this shimmering film all over the bottom of the plate.  The tofu in the dish was firm tofu but it wasn't cooked enough, so it had a crumbly texture rather than the soft insides that a well-cooked tofu should have.  

My sis went to use the restroom...I didn't dare. She came back and said I should stay away. I didn't ask for details, and didn't care to experience that horror show.   

I was not a fan of Joe's...but because my sis liked it and our new friend next to us liked it as well, I'm giving it 2 stars vs. just the 1 star I would have based on my meal.",0
"Tourist trap alert!!!

Man this place is overrated to the n-th degree. Compare the overratedness of this place to House of Nanking in San Francisco. Both these places probably got some endorsement from some food critic years and years ago and rested on their laurels forever.

Only thing remotely good here was the Drunk Duck (basically duck soaked in alcohol and spices and served cold) - hence two stars instead of one. The XLBs were so mediocre it wasn't funny - and in the meantime, I'm witnessing these folks at our table announce to each other how good the XLBs were, like they had to confirm with one another that, in fact, their hourlong wait was not in vain! Was I in the Twilight Zone or something? Because that's how it felt like...

Guys, guys, guys, snap out of it! I, for one, was outraged for having to make the long trek down to Chinatown, wait 30 minutes, and get served these super-mediocre XLBs. And I certainly don't need someone to tell me that the long wait somehow miraculously changed these crappy XLBs into something special, because it didn't. Hello!

I mean, come on, seriously... I have a thick skin, but the skins on these XLB were thicker than mine.",0
"Tourist trap.  Don't go here.

It's a tiny place that seems to always be packed.  We had approx 45 minute wait (new years day) for a party of 4.

First thing I noticed -- most of the people are white.  Shit.  My expectations immediately dropped.  I'm sorry if your'e white and reading this, but it's generally true -- an asian place with mostly white people does not tend to be very good.

But anyway, we are put into a tiny table and order the soup dumplings.  $5 for 8 pork and $7 for 8 crab/shrimp.

The pork dumplings were boring.  It definitely is a dish that depended on the fat from the pork for flavor -- not much else going on as far as flavors go.

The seafood dumplings were better.  You could really taste the crab in the dumplings.  It also has some weird metallic aftertaste.  I', not sure if it was coming from the dip or the dumplings themselves.

Anotehr issue I have with the place is the way the dumplings are served.  I'm ordering soup dumplings.  That means I want the taste of the soup.  So waht that means for the cook is to make sure the dumplings are not touching the steaming basket or stuck to each other.  Because the dumplings will rip and the juices will leak out.  Fail.  Some of the dupmlings seemed to be missing the soup altogether.  I'm a very good chopsticks user and I got blueballed a few times as I bit into the dumpling for the juices -- and it was already dry inside.

I also lol'd when i saw white people poking the dumplings with their chopsticks, letting the juices all leak out.  Don't do that guys.

The scallion pancakes -- crap.

Oh yeah, 15% gratuity added no matter what, even though the service sucks.

I'm going to make sure my friends avoid wasting a night out in NYC here.",0
"No idea why this place gets such high ratings, the food is just plain okay but pretty bland. They're not very friendly and rush you in and out, the waiters never step aside while you're walking through but instead try to push their way in front of you.  If you are a small party of 1 or 2 they crowd you in at someone else's table which gets awkward fast.  Also they force a 15% tip and are cash only.",0
"I'm not going to lie to you, I haven't been super impressed by Joe's Shanghai.  Everyone raves about the dumplings and while they're good they didn't really change my life.  Everything else I ordered was pretty forgettable.  And frankly the dumplings probably would have been too if it weren't for the extreme caution required to eat them.  With respect to that, by the way, I suggest picking one up in the spoon provided, breaking it open and sipping out the juice like hot tea first and then as it becomes suitably cooled eat the actual dumpling. Perhaps add a little sauce if you're into that sort of thing.  The Family style seating is kind of cool if you are sat next to interesting people but it can suck if your table mates are obnoxious (aka tourists).",0
"Been here for like 3 times already because different people all want to check it out. The pork soup dumplings are definitely very soupy and hot but they are way too greasy for me and the flavor really isn't as good than alot of other soup dumplings i have had in Asia. 
The crab and pork dumplings are definitely better than the the regular pork ones. We also had other dishes there, which were just ok

Overall, i think it's way too hyped up. not worth the wait",0
"This place is on everyone's go to soup dumplings list. I had the pleasure of coming here when visiting friends one time, and did not know anything about how popular this place was. They do not take reservations, so I waited for about 35-40 minutes outside, in the cold. When it was finally our turn to be seated, I was almost ready to call it quits, if it wasn't for the investment of time I had already sunk in. I went with a group of friends, about 10 of us in total. We ordered several orders of the pork soup dumplings, and 2 orders of the crab soup dumplings, along with some lo mein, fried rice, several other dishes. The experience was good, but I the crab soup dumplings were the most memorable. They were memorble because they were not good, compared to the rest of the dishes. I remember taking a bite, and thought to myself if I really had to finish the rest of it. The flavor was off, it did not taste like I was eating crab, but more of like something foul. The regular soup dumplings, were pretty good, but absolutely forgettable. If this is your favorite or only place you know to get soup dumplings then by all means keep going, it's not bad. However, if you want to know if there are other restaurants that serve also serve delicious soup dumplings, the answer is yes! Go do some research, you will definitely find better soup dumplings. 

Overall:
I later find out that it was not as popular with locals as it was with tourists. Apparently when tourists google soup dumplings, this place pops up from all the good reviews from other tourists, and being a competent restaurant, they were able to maintain a good image and good reviews from out of town-ers, which gives it its high score of 4 stars. However, it's not the same with locals here. There are other restaurants here that serve the same quality soup dumplings, and some maybe even better based on personal preference. The long lines from tourists are usually a turn off for most locals, and they prefer to go to less popular establishment but still serve delicious soup dumplings.",0
Cash only.  Share table.  Food was hot and fresh.  Service and price are much better than Midtown location.,0
"Hype Hype Hype!

Soup dumplings were OK at best. The skin was kinda tough. Though, it looks like the dumplings were overcooked instead. FYI, if the skin sticks to the steamer or to each other, its likely the dumplings were overcooked. overcooked sink becomes sticky and tears really easily. Portion sizes were reasonably large. Each dumpling was bigger than the spoon. Mostly soup and skin, not too much filling. The dumplings were not made that well either. A couple of them opened up while steaming so the soup just all leaked out (probably cuz it was over cooked).  The crab filling still had bits of crab shell.

Other than that, all the other dishes were mediocre.  The sliced beef noodle soup was bland. The noodles were a tad too hard and chewy.  The sesame chicken had way too much batter. Some of the batter wasn't fully cooked.

I guess Joe's Shanghai is one of those NYC tourist locations milking as much of their own mythology as much as they can before it's gone.

Bottom line, this place is just another old school tired restaurant. If you care for soup dumplings, you can definitely find better places, cheaper places, more interesting places, more authentic places in NYC.",0
NOT WORTH IT. Definitely tourist trap. We went to a different place for xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and was so glad we did. We came back to Joe's afterwards just to try and it was underwhelming. The XLB was too fatty with not much flavor. The skin was also a little on the thick side - a bad sign. I really didn't even want to finish the rest of the XLB. Cheap? Yes. Get what you pay for? Yes. The wait here is too long and is overhyped.,0
"2 stars. Maybe 3 if I'm feeling happy. 

Not sure what all the fuss is about. Seems to me like a classic case of a lack of options. 

You see,  I am taiwanese and come from southern California, so I've had my fair share of din tai fung and the like, both in the motherland and back in La. 
Joes does NOT compare. Here's why:

The food isn't that good. But I understand that there's not many options in the area for those looking for the authentic Chinese meal. 
I ordered the classic dumplings, mixed option, and it came out in a speedy 10 minutes despite the restaurant being packed (I ate alone and sat at a community table with 3 other parties). 
The dumplings themselves just looked unappealing. The texture wasn't great and would stick to your mouth,  and the flavor of the meat and juice was average. 

Now for the service. Usually I let Asian establishments off the hook for horrible service bc that is just the culture. Knowing that,  I expect some tlc if yelpers give this place a freaking 4 on 2k reviews. 

Don't be fooled by the wall of celebrities, they just don't know any better, so you shouldn't either. 
That being said,  if you've never had this kind of entree before,  then I'm sure you'll love it as something to set the bar low for the future. 

Note: just in case you consider me biased as preferring taiwanese over shanghainese, I don't have any,  and consider myself an American that just loves to eat the best of the best. 

And I will say their other dishes looked and smelled good. So take this review for the dumplings only.",0
"Having lived off of soup dumplings (by choice) whenever I visit Shanghai and it's neighboring regions, I can honestly say the dumplings here did very little for me. In every other aspect, these had the hallmarks of an authentic soup dumpling. But when it comes to the flavor, it's like someone took a soup dumpling and turned down the volume by about a third. 

There is only one redeeming factor about these dumplings, and that is the fact that they exist at all. It can be remarkably hard to find these in other parts of the country, so it's definitely worth a trip to try these if you've never had them. 

Don't bother with the rest of the menu. You can get much better versions of everything on the menu elsewhere on Canal.",0
"I went to Joe's Shanghai with eight of my friends, we were all starving so we ordered the crab and pork dumplings as a starter with the idea of ordering more dishes afterwords. 

It was early afternoon, not really a busy time, we were seated right away and the dumplings came very quickly as well. 

I picked up a dumpling, put it on my plate, sat the plate in front of myself, and then stared at it for a good minute because there was a COOKED COCKROACH stuck to my dumpling. 

Sorry Joe's, I won't be eating at your place any time ever.",0
Went to try the famous soup dumplings. Honestly they were just as good as any other soup dumplings but still great. I do think the place is overhyped and we had to wait in line and take a number to get in,0
"The food was great but I got a food poisoning later.
Waiter was kinda rude.
He told us to leave right after we paid the bill because people were waiting.
But do I go back?
Yes!
The food was that great.",0
"If you're coming here, only get the soup dumplings and the scallion ""pie"". The soups dumplings are huge and contain a lot of soup. The scallion ""pie"" is thick and crunchy. 

Everything else here is terrible. We got the eggplant dish and it tasted like someone knocked over the sugar into the dish. Does not taste authentic at all. We ordered four dishes aside from the soup dumplings and scallion ""pie"" and could not finish any of it because it was just disgusting. The meat in the soup was old and sour-- inedible.",0
I really liked the soup dumplings. It's just waaay too crowded though. I would definitely go back to try other things but I want me some soup dumplings again =),0
Good food but relatively slow service and hurried at the beginning which made it hard. Good duck though and cheap wine!,0
"Was decent, but was definitely not worth the hour and a half wait. Soup dumplings is a must try when at a Shanghai restaurant. However, I was not very fond of their soup dumplings. Considering that their dumplings keeps ripping and some are even leaking soup out before we even get them. Had their Shanghai noodles but was okay.",0
"Horrible customer service! If there were minus 5 stars to give, I would definitely have chosen it. Didn't eat. I am not going to spend money for the bad service. I can have the same kind of food anywhere in Chinatown.",0
"TOURIST TRAP!!! If you like going to Bubba Gump Shrimp and other tourist traps like that, this place is definitely for you. There's no locals there at all. I'm so pissed I even wasted two hours of my life eating here. The dumplings were not even good, if you have been to DTF, you know what I mean. The bathroom was a nightmare, beyond disgusting. 
The dumplings and every single dish we ordered had about a half a gallon of oil in it. 
This Joe guy is probably counting his cash and laughing at all you stupid Americans.",0
"The worst soup dumplings I've ever had.  Overly fishy crab, limp wrappers, tasteless broth.  All served on unappetizing lettuce leaves. The vinegar/ginger sauce tasted rancid. I can't believe the positive Yelp reviews. 

The dining atmosphere is terrible.  Chaotic, noisy, ice cold a/c's blowing air directly on patrons.

People:  If you think Joe's has good bao, you owe it to yourself to check out  Grand Sichuan on 29th and 9th.  You'll thank me.",0
"If you want to try authentic chinese food, please do not come here. Everything here is Americanized, i order spicy fish filet, a big no no. Probably they do better at shanghai food, but I'm not a big fan of ""one restaurant, multiple cuisine"" at all.",0
"When you come here all you should get is the soup dumplings.  Everything else is just so so.  The place is definitely very dirty and crowded.  It's a place you order your food, eat as fast as you can and get out.  Not a place to sit around and just hang.  The waiters there are very very rude.  When given the check, 1 or 2 of the wait staff stands around to make sure there's enough tip.  There was one time, they embarrassed a customer by yelling out ""you didn't give enough"".  I think I would have been mortified if it happened to me.  I hate going there just for that reason.  It's one thing if they gave great service and should deserve the 15 or 20% tip.  But when food is thrown at you, and they have difficulty taking your order because they don't speak or understand english and they look like they are bothered when asking for a different fork because it's dirty one, I think 10% should be sufficient enough.  The wait staff is taking advantage of the fact that everyone goes there for the soup dumplings and no matter how bad the service is, customers will always go back because of their food. 

i've been back enough times and every time I leave that place I always say, no more.",0
"OVERALL 3 stars. Been here two times. They're all about their dumplings so right off the bat they ask you how many dumplings you want and what type of meat. The servers speak fast so it can be hard to understand plus their accent. I'm Asian too and I have a hard time understanding them. Servers seem overwhelmed and stressed. Hard to get something from them.  

DUMPLINGS sure they're tasty and it's kind of annoying you bite into it and all the soup liquid comes gushing out so be sure to have a bowl right under it. But it's not where I'm back in California now craving them type of that tasty good if you know what I mean. But they're good sure. 

FOOD other food was ok good. Nothing absolutely mind blowing. 

INSIDE is not that big considering they PACK AS MANY tables and chairs. You end up sitting with people you don't know. It's hard to move around and get around. If you're claustrophobic you will not like eating here. If it wasn't so cramped I would probably like this place better. Photos on the wall of famous people who have eaten here are cool to look at. 

Bathrooms in the back are dirty and grungy one room toilet style, but if you gotta go you gotta go especially after drinking all the soup that comes out of those dumplings. Haha. 

WAIT yes you might have to wait a long time and either it's really hot when I came or really cold. Makes it annoying to wait around due to extreme weather conditions I'm not used to. Parking is street parking so expect to circle around and around looking and probably have to walk and keep track of the time to re feed a meter.",0
"yes xiao long bao might seem like it's the same everywhere but it really isnt and this review is SOLELY on the XLB cause i didnt get anything else =P

pretty affordable for the size you get...i think it was like 5.65 for a tray and they're pretty hefty portions than most places

the XLB here are a little bit fattier than most and you can definitely taste it in the broth inside the dumpling and you can kinda see it too, a little rich but not super heavy.  
I liked it

The only thing was! my XLBs' skin was a little tough, like as if it has been cooked and sitting out for a bit and the dumpling's skin harden which made eating and enjoying it a little difficult.

Definitely a must try in NYC

on a side note! - beware of the waiters, i know for a fact i heard one of the waiters fart loudly and he was within proximity of where i was eating...lost of my appetite afterward AND when asked about the tip charge that was ALREADY added onto my bill, the waiter said yes and i can hear the other waiter speaking in mandarin giving him crap about why did he tell me that and he could have gotten more money from me (wow...luckily i understood him)",0
I came here because I saw a video on how amazing the soup dumplings were! I feel like when I came inside I wasn't expecting the place to look or serve what it did. I thought it would be a dim sum or authentic Chinese restaurant but it really wasn't. I don't know if I would come back,0
"Thus far, this has to be the most disappointing meal I have had in NYC. For the number of positive reviews I have seen on this place and the number of news article written, I have to say I am not a fan. 

After waiting for over 1 hour in 35 degree weather, we were put together with another family and was forced to share a single table. 

Can't say I am accustomed to that but what really bothered me was the quality of the food.

We ordered some mapo tofu.... it did not taste like mapo tofu at all! It was blend, and was not a tad bit spicy. We also ordered a crispy duck.... and it was way too salty and the duck was dry.

Their xiao long bao ""soup dumpling"" was ok. I've had better. 

Long story short, I was not at all impressed.... and if asked if I would go back.... that would be a no.

There are plenty of people that will like this place because they have not had better food but unfortunately I have.",0
"Decided to try this place out because of all the raving reviews. The entire place is super packed with 2-3 different parties sitting at your table. It was pretty awkward since it was a round table. 

Also the food wasn't phenomenal. The only dish that stood out to me was the soup dumplings which is the only reason for tourist visits. 

Please be aware that portions are big! Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs :/",0
"Coming from San Francisco, which has a huge 1st generation Chinese and Asian American population, I had much higher expectations for NY Chinatown Chinese food. 

To me, overall the entrees were too Americanized and lacked flavor but the biggest disappointment was the Chow Fun! The noodles texture felt like they had been saturated in water for far too long and then microwaved. I mean, honestly, how can General Tso chicken lack flavor???My husband really enjoyed the soup dumplings, but I cannot attest to those because all of them (even the crab ones) had pork inside of them and I don't eat pork. In fact, the food, at this restaurant was so bad that our meal ended, when I asked, ""are we just eating this food because we spent $60 and this doesn't seem like the type of restaurant that remove items off the bill""?

I'll try another restaurant in NY Chinatown, eventually, but it won't be this place!",0
"the crab dumplings were good, but nothing to go crazy about, i order salt pepper duck was good too, my only complaint was that i ordered one Crab dumpling dish, and they brought me 2... wtf is that. people who work there are shady and always looking to tack on something to your bill.",0
"I went here with a party of 5 on Saturday evening. The wait was about 40 minutes which was probably the longest time I waited for a Chinese restaurant.

The menu consisted of a mix of Chinese-American dishes and more traditional dishes. We ordered noodles, scallion pancakes, chinese vegetables, egg fried rice and of course, the soup dumplings. I don't really eat pork but I just had to try one and omg! It was so good. It tasted a little MSG-ey but it was still good. I also enjoyed the egg fried rice, but it was a little mushy. The rest were just okay.

The service was quite good as well. I found it funny that most of the diners here were NOT Chinese or any kind of Asian, which was strange considering that this place is super popular and is in Chinatown. Nonetheless, it was still good to me but I would not go out of my way and wait 40 minutes for this place. Plus, my native Shanghainese friend claims that this place is not authentic at all. Oh well!",0
"I'm starting to get the feeling that Joe either employs my friends or puts some kind of crack in their food. Whenever I meet up with them at school and ask ""where do you want to go for lunch?"" the same thing always comes out of their mouth. Joe's Shanghai. Which is always followed by my sighing and asking ""didn't we just go there last week?"" Seriously they are Joe's Shanghai addicts. We usually make the short journey from City Hall and grab lunch then either rush back to class or go our separate ways. 

As soon as we're seated the waiter immediately asks how many of the XLB (haha props to the yelper who made that up) you want. We usually opt for about 3 or 4. Get the ones with the crab meat. It gives the XLB that slight hint of sweet seafood flavor. Once in a while we throw in a scallion pancake. I can't say they're great but I suppose they're not awful either. Let's just say I've definitely had better. I also came here once with my girlfriend and aside from ordering the XLB we also had the Cha Cherng Mein (not sure of the translation but I think it's noodles with shanghainese sauce). It's actually pretty tasty and they give you lots of noodles and lots of sauce. I like my noodles like I like my women, saucy. 

Be warned, none of the waiters or waitresses speak a word of English or any dialect of Chinese outside of Mandarin. Their extent of English consists roughly of everything on the menu. I once asked for a replacement plate and chopsticks because mine were dirty and it took three waiters and lots of hand motions on my part before I finally got what I asked for. I was this close to flailing my arms and possibly drawing stick figures or diagrams. It may or may not be due to the language barrier but I feel that the service here is sub par. They always try to stuff as many people as possible onto a table and then get you in and out as quickly as possible. I always feel like I'm being rushed. My friend has gotten into countless arguments with the waitresses. most recently because rather than give us our own table for a party of 6 in a half empty restaurant, they tried to squish us into a table with other patrons. But then again she is Taiwanese and from Flushing so you know what I'm saying. Haha, I kid I kid! Don't hate me!!

My opinion? The food is pretty good but the service could use some work. It's also a tourist trap and to be honest I'm quite impartial to tourist traps. I can think of other places in Chinatown to have XLB and with better service too. Prices here are also slightly higher then other Shanghainese places. If not for my friends I probably wouldn't come as often, if at all.",0
"Haven't been to Joe's Shanghai in awhile but I was craving for some soup dumplings. My fave place would be Nan Xiang in Flushing for it but since I was in Ctown, I decided to come here. One thing I hate about this place is that it's filled with tourists usually, where tour buses would bring them here which I find pretty annoying. Next, they love to make you share tables which is what happened to me last night. Had to share with 3 other groups on a big table. For 2 people, we ordered 2 orders of soup dumplings. shanghai noodles and a pork chop noodle soup. I used to love this place back in the days but I feel like some things have gone down hill for sure. Soup dumplings have definitely gotten saltier and pork chop were so so. Shanghai Asian Cuisine on Mott Street might be better than them now. I won't be coming back here. Wished Din Tai Fung was in NYC.",0
"Come here for soup dumpling, and just for dumpling soup....
I recommend to eat it there though, taste different if you take it out, even after you microwaved it. 
If you want to eat another dish, go somewhere else... Had beef broccoli, and squid with black bean before and it was a big disappointment, so not worth the price they put there. I found better taste, with better price around.

One thing that i really dont like it here is that mandatory service charge 15% that they put automatically in your bill. I found some restaurant charge it if we have large party, but Joe charges it even for 1 customer. Well we have to pay tips anyway but, i think its sneaky for the restaurant to add it without prior notice anywhere. I remember when I first eat there, and didn't know about  this, and we ended up double tip them, like 35% from total.. For just ok service that we got, I don't think they deserved it.. I'm very sure I'm not the only one who didn't know bout this, and paying more tips more than we thought. Maybe it's their way to get more tips, or tourist trap? but come on !!! You get more tips if you improve your service, right???",0
"Very shortly after discovering this place--I'll admit, a real treasure--it became my favorite restaurant in Manhattan. This was a few years ago. I came here alone frequently. I came here with friends frequently. I wanted to be here constantly... I learned how to eat the soup dumplings: hold on spoon, take a small bite, let juices into spoon, let steam rise, take small bites, take small sips of broth, have multiple orgasms... In Shanghai, at least in some establishments, these are served with a straw. More fun, and much more accessible... I used to prefer the pork with crab, for a more tender center, but then I came to prefer the overall more delectable pork only... 

The real thing that won me over about this place was the jellyfish. Real quality, real simplicity, real cheap... I'd been places like Chin Chin and Shun Lee Palace, both of which I think entirely missed the idea (or were perhaps trying to camouflage the essence of this amazing acquired taste) but here I had, right in front of me, completely accessible in terms of price and location--and, as I soon learned, consistency--a wonderful dish... 

Delicious dishes: [cold] sliced kidneys with mixed vegetables, ducks web with celery, drunken crab. [soup] salted egg and sliced pork with mustard greens, ham and winter melon, hong kong style hot and sour (which is, still, every time I have this, a childhood favorite, the best I've had in ages). [seafood] spicy buffalo carp fish belly, braised sea cucumber with pork tendon. [pork] lima bean salad and pork with bean curd tripe, lion's head (SO GOOD). [noodles] shredded pork with pickled cabbage vermicelli soup, szechuan beef tendon vermicelli soup... Another favorite, which must have a rather small seasonal availability, is ""salt and pepper silver fish with jalapeno"" which I haven't seen or heard of in awhile... 

You pretty much always have to share a table. The service is friendly. The bathrooms are clean. The prices are good... It's touristy, but usually only populated by the very bravest tourists since the ""average"" American will run away as soon as they see Pell Street or the line outside or the communal tables or realize that most of their favorite dishes aren't available.",0
"Had the crab and pork xlb which were disappointing because a few were not sealed properly and had no soup by the time they got to us.  The flavor was good though. The fried pork dumplings were delicious and the scallion pancakes were my favorite.

Find them a bit expensive for Chinatown.

Will be back to try other menu items and the scallion pancakes again!",0
The xltb's skin were not so thin and the flour were thick and dry! We ordered a steamed fish and it came out overdone and tasted bitter.,0
"Soup dumplings are definitely amazing and some of the best you can find in New York City. However, considering the crowds of tourists, I don't know if it's particularly worth it. The rest of the food is good as well, but nothing you can't get at another solid Shanghainese restaurant in Chinatown.",0
"Xiao long Bao was ok skin was a little thick and  not as good as the ones I've had elsewhere (Flushing Queens I'm not reviewing to promote another restaurant). Also ordered beef and veg on pan fried noodles ,beef had a weird flavorless texture so just ate the vegetables. The pan fried noodles were white puffy and tough and not pan fried ,we left that on the plate also. Had the vegetable and bean curd ,veggies were ok but bean curd was deep fried and held oil like a sponge ,left that on the plate also. Saw this restaurant on a you tube episode and went in  excited and came out disappointed.  Place was busy ,lines out the door, go figure the hype and no Asians eating there... hmmmm... 9/15/18.",0
"This place is ok. The soup dumplings are okay, it was a bit too brothy for me. The lo mein was not that tasty and on your bland side. Green onion pancakes were really oily. Not a fan",0
"Ordered:
1. Crab & Pork Soup Dumpling- Ground meat texture instead of what I'm used to in my dumpling which is more smooth and cohesive. Did not like it much compared to other soup dumplings I've had. It was not that ""soupy"". Only 2 choices of soup dumpling. The other was only pork. 
2. Mixed Vegetable Dish- It had tofu and probably 6 different vegetables. Good sauce. 

Ambiance- Typical Chinese restaurant. Crowded but we were lucky to not have to stand in line as we got there early around 6pm. Nice and attentive waiters.",0
"The food was really nice we tried the buns or soup dumplings and we tried the eggplants which we love. On weekends the place is crowded and inside is also very busy, not a quiet relaxing place and you seat altogether with strangers  in these large tables which to me it was ok but if you have to share private or more intimate conversations that is not the right place. They have an extensive menu but I understand they are famous for their soup dumplings which were really good.",0
"Why is this popular? Just because you make the shanghai dumplings huge, doesn't make them good. The soup and meat were bland. The green beans had a weird rubbery texture. The shanghai noodles were very oily. Honestly, this would be considered the worst Chinese food  in SF",0
"I remember the days when Joe Shanghai was thee place to get your soup dumpling fix.  But somehow this place became more and more tailored to tourists and quality plummeted (probably to keep up with the demand). Plus I don't like waiting over an hour just to get seated.  

I prefer Kung Fu Xiao long bao or Nan Xian in Flushing for that soup dumpling fix now.",0
"Horrible! The staff and servers are SO rude and dismissive that it truly is a problem. The food is greasy and unimpressive. Just skip it! Not to mention the bedraggled ambiance - ok i get it that it's what you get for that price- but with so many spectacular options in NYC- why suffer this?!
The servers were soooo rude and inattentive that we had to go and ask the hostess for our check and she also didn't seem to care one bit. Just pathetic!
Spare yourself the waste of time and subpar food- go around the corner to NY Noodletown instead!",0
"This place is too overrated. Got to Chinatown, and into Joe's Shanghai for their ""famous"" soup dumplings. 
They were OK, but not worth any wait or any bragging. Half of our dumplings popped before we could even drink the soup. The pork dumpling tasted a bit like liverwurst, I don't know. 

Just to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.",0
"Joes shanghai is as authentic as china town gets. Although it has an A sanitation rating, it does not look extremely clean. They do not take reservation and things can get a little wild / unorganized at the door. If you are looking for a date spot this is not the place. All the large tables are communal seating and you are pretty much sharing dishes with others at your table. We ordered the soup dumplings which did not disappoint. Joes is known for their soup dumplings and they were extremely juice. I also recommend getting the shanghai flat noodles. The noodles are very thick and delicious. Aside from the mess at the door and the communal seating the food was delicious.",0
"This restaurant is highly overrated  but I may be biased since I just recently finished a six month stint in China. The food at Joe's Shanghai is nothing compared to its advertised equivalent that you can find on the streets of Shanghai or Hong Kong for a fourth of the price. 

The food was decent, but it was also not what I expected after seeing its stellar reviews. Chris and I ordered both types of xiao long bao (pork steamed buns, crab meat and pork steamed buns) and the crispy jumbo prawns with meat sauce. The prawns looked and tasted like a over-battered version of sweet and sour pork--with shrimp. There were no hints of meat sauce or spices (the menu item had a chili pepper icon next to it). It was a bit overcooked and too sweet, which would have been okay if sweet and sour shrimp was actually what I ordered.   

Now for the soup dumplings. The size of the dumplings is much larger than average. This means it takes much longer to eat, so by the time I got to my second dumpling the skin was already cold and hard. When it's cooled, the top of the dumpling is almost inedible because of the thick and doughy skin. These type of dumplings however are typically made with extremely thin skins that serve to bring attention to the meat and soup within. I needed to eat the skin separately just to make sure the dough doesn't overpower the taste of the filling. As for the filling itself, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the two types I ordered. They tasted exactly the same: frozen, bland mystery meat. The soup compensated by being very rich and heavy. Put together, the dumplings were passable. 

Service was fine. The waiter was a bit overzealous at the beginning of our service. I had to tell him three times that I wasn't ready to order; but after that, he left us alone unless we needed him. 

There's no comparison to the real deal. If you've had authentic xiao long bao before, you'll be severely disappointed with Joe's Shanghai. However, I wouldn't be surprised if this is as good as New York's got. So if you're new to soup dumplings, by all means go here. 

- Tiffany",0
I like the food but the service merits a 2 star! I simply hate waiting on a line when the staff shows no urgency to get me seated. It's also just too crowded to sit. Definitely consider taking out instead,0
"Let me start off by mentioning I am a huge dumpling fan. I had been dying to try Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings and literally waited in the rain to be seated. The line is long, expect that. 

The restaurant itself is pretty big and they do a good job of packing everyone in. It did take a while for us to be waited on however. 

The crab and pork soup dumplings were a nice size and the flavor was pretty good but the texture wasn't the best I've had. There was something missing from the broth so I can say I've had better dumplings. 

The scallion pancake was very greasy, and don't get me wrong I love a bit of grease, but the oil on these overpowered the doughy-ness I normally love.. Again I've had better. 

The crispy fried beef was a nice shareable serving but it was unexpectedly sweet and while the first few bites were good the sticky sweetness completely overpowered the dish. 

My main issue with Joe's is not the food, it was the lack of cleanliness. The menus were dirty the place itself felt a little run down and the major thing for me was the vinegar and chili oil  serving dishes were dirty and seemed to not be changed out. 

I had heard so much about this place and was a little disappointed that it wasn't what I expected but I might be back to give it another try.",0
"I used to love Joe's Shanghai.  But this last experience was terrible.   Utensils were all dirty and the Lion's Head and Pork shoulder had no flavor.  Except a bit of over sweetness.   As if they forgot to flavor it with the savory part.  Had to ask for some soy sauce just to add some flavor.  

It's gone so far downhill as to be not worth visiting.   I would advise everyone to find another place for Shanghainese food.  Very disappointed.",0
"Dine in this restaurant after COVID-19 reopen. The place seems ok and clean, my friend and I order a fish, and after 20 mins the waiter told us we didn't actually ordered that because he thought we're just asking for recommendations when we're ordering. Then it took them another 30 mins to cook that. And after we tried that fish, I have to say I am furious. The fish tastes like mud and must have been frozen for a long time. I understand the difficulties that restaurants were facing during COVID but they shouldn't do this. Very disappointed. By the way, the waiter just took 10 dollars off our bill while we barely eat the 20 dollar fish.",0
"Ate at Joe's Shanghai this last Sunday the wait for our party of 8 was not too bad at all took about 20 minutes. Our group ordered the:

Crab Dumplings
Pork Dumplings
Fried Mini Buns
Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce
Sauteed Seasonal Vegetables
Sliced Braised Beef Noodle Soup
Pan Fried Noodles
Singapore Chow Mei Fun

The price is okay for New York, expensive for china town there are a lot of better places to eat in china town. The food was oily and not very flavorful.
The pork dumplings are decent the soup is a bit salty but it seems like this is the only place around that one can get soup dumplings hence the rave reviews. The Braised beef Noodle Soup wasn't bad either.

It is china town so the restaurant is not the cleanest and the decor is typical.",0
"I was disappointed at the Xiao Long Baos.. It wasn't what I expected. I've definitely had better. I also ordered the Shanghai noodle and I think that was even better than the dumplings. I had saw the reviews and since it was our first time in NY, we went all the way to Chinatown from Times Square to try it. Definitely was not worth it.",0
"Overall an average experience for us in Joe. We had a few dishes and their soup bums. Reasonable prices and quick turnaround time. Perhaps our standard is a bit high given we have some very authentic Chinese in Sydney, so we didn't find the food particularly special. 

Plenty of non Chinese patrons so I guess they are doing something right. Not a place for native Chinese unless they are going for a quick bite and doesn't want to walk far for other options.",0
"Came here for a quick bite recommended by a local friend. 

Soup dumplings and scallion pancakes were ordered. 

Soup dumplings were nice, hot, and steamy! Delicious as well. 

Scallion pancakes were amazing and crisp. It was good with the sauce given. Both are recommended. 

Service was fast and typical of an Asian place. Shared a table which is a nice way to meet people and have them take pictures. haha.",0
"I like to come here on a weekday to avoid the rush. I don't eat meat, which pisses me off, because I've heard the soup dumplings are amazing. Plenty other yummy things for me to choose from though. Their scallion pancakes are the best I've ever had, and the Shanghai fried rice is delicious. Service is quintessential Chinatown style, quick and efficient, so go in with low expectations and realize that gratuity is included in the check. Really hard to find this place for the first time, as I don't think Pell has a street sign, but after one trip you'll remember forever!",0
sadly Joe's is not what it used to be. Most of my soup dumplings were broken. It seems to be flooded with tourists.,0
"I should have gone with my gut when I saw that less than 1 of every 10 people dining here were Asian. This is one time I should not have listened to Yelp.

Guys, I don't care how many famous people eat here. The food was so generic, watered down, flavorless, and Americanized that I really would have been happier at Panda Express. REALLY. 

The scallion bread is greasy as hell here, and their dishes are covered in flavorless sauce. If this is what NY Chinatown is about, fuggedaboutit- I'm going back to Houston Chinatown. 

The one redeeming food we had? Their iconic, much-lauded Xiao Long Bao (translated into Chinese as ""Little Dragon Soup Dumplings,"" just for your shits and grins). Those were served searing hot with a nice texture and 6.95 for 8, I believe. 

There are plenty of restaurants full of CHINESE people in Chinatown here. Try one of those. I should have. 

Enjoy your standard surly Chinese service (to be expected at any Chinese restaurant) at a flat rate of 15% tagged onto the bill already. Cash only.",0
"We went to Chinatown to get some good Chinese food and this place was not it. The staff were not that friendly and the food didn't seem well seasoned, like they were missing salt in everything. We got the fried rice, soup dumplings and I got the hot beef soup. The soup was just hot and not flavorful at all. We will not be back unfortunately.",0
"I discovered this tourist spot by accident. I thought it was gonna be Joe's rice rolls. 

Their specialty is pork/crab soup dumplings. The first few were good; the crab is with pork. The remainder weren't so good. I dunno why. 

On the other hand, the eggplant slaps! Usually the eggplant is shrimp but theirs comes with tender pork strips. Delish leftovers. 

The service was meh. Oh they only take cash",0
"Went there yesterday on the hype of the Shanghai soup dumpling. While that is a ok, the rest of the menu items are not. I am a tourist so it's easy for me to say that I won't visit this place for my next NYC visit.",0
"We had the XLB, subgum casserole, eel with chives, and stir-fried vegetables. The soup was quite delicious. Unfortunately the XLB wasn't quite as good as what I had in their Flushing location. Overall, the entrees were a bit too oily for our taste.

We also had to share a table with another customer.",0
"I'm sad to say that Joes did not live up to the hype. We went on a soup dumpling crawl to six different restaurants and Joe's was tied for least favorite. We might have had a bad batch but our dumplings' skin were so thick, all of the dumplings were already broken so all that was left inside was oily pork :( 

21 Shanghai House around the corner had no wait and were so much better. Sorry Joe's :( 

Their scallion pancakes were amazing though!! Would go back just for them.",0
"Came here on a Monday night- no wait but was seated next to the cleaning supplies. Gross.  I've had Joe's before, but this visit really made me realize that I do not want to come here again. I ordered the pork XLB with the delicious soup inside. The only downside to the dumplings is that they smell like feet. Don't get me wrong, they are definitely tasty....but just smell horrible. I notice the same smell from Joe's Ginger's dumplings (which has the same owner). 

FYI tip is included in your bill.",0
"I hear about Joe's Shanghai from different crowds. Many in NY deem it the best Shanghai Dumplings they've ever had. Me? I pity them. 

Food: 
Pork Shanghai Dumplings - Lots of broth which means they use a lot of lard. Very good flavors but why the heck is the skin so thick? 
Crab Shanghai Dumplings - Almost no broth. Same thick skin. 
Vegetables - The bok choys were not the freshest. Even so most restaurants will just snap the ugly looking areas off....they didn't bother with that. 

Btw our vinegar saucer can use more ginger! 

Service: 
Very fast paced...wait staff gave us the hurry and eat mentality. Ordered two items then the waiter bounced off leaving us with blank reactions...like....is he coming back to take the rest of our order...? 

Environment: 
I love older Chinese restaurants. It adds to the flavors. 

Price: 
Not too pricey. 

Din Tai Fung in California and Asia is light years better than this. Heck the lesser known joints in those areas make better dumplings. Don't believe the hype. 

Food: 3
Service: 1
Environment: 3
Price: 4",0
The dumplings themselves were great. I had the pork and crab mixed with pork dumplings. A little bigger than I'm used too but tasty! The dumplings themselves are 4 stars but the atmosphere and restaurant facilities suck. Who wants to be crammed in a table with random other people. But its New York City chinatown so you can't really be expecting 5 star amenities and service. The standard that I compare all dumplings to though is Din Tai Fung in LA and in Taiwan. So compared to there the dumplings are just a notch below and they don't offer the dessert dumplings that Din Tai Fun does. Overall Joe's Shanghai is good but no reason to make a special outing there if you are there on vacation with precious time to spare.,0
Soup dumplings were just okay... Some had absolute no soup some had... The reason why I gave them 1 star is because the waiters were absolutely obnoxious. Can not believe how rude they were. Would not comeback here again.,0
"I'm giving it 3 stars just because i feel that people hyped up the soup dumpling so much for me, and we waited about an hour to be seated, and I thought it was ok.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but I just don't think soup dumplings are my thing.  The  other dishes we got were good.  Glad I crossed it off my list of places to go, but i think i would only go back if I had friends who really want to try it out.",0
"Let me start by saying that I love supporting my fellow Asian restaurants and would prefer to write 5-star reviews but this place is more hype than good or delicious. If NYC patrons really enjoy this restaurant, then they have not truly enjoyed delicious authentic Chinese food. 

Who is Joe? And has be been to Shanghai?
Joe's Shanghai caters to those that like so called soup dumplings that tasted good but aren't delicious.

Joe did get the authentic Chinese service unfortunately of the rude and apathetic servers.

How many times did I have to ask for hot tea for my invited guests? Three times before they got anything hot to drink after coming in from the pouring rain.

We ordered both their pork dumplings and crabmeat pork dumplings but just got the pork ones. UPDATE: Got charged for the crabmeat pork dumplings too and only noticed after I paid :(

We ordered the Shanghai fried rice, Chicken lo mein, Crispy pan-fried noodles with beef, scallion chicken, and string beans sautéed in garlic.

Funny thing, the string bean sautéed in garlic was the table favorite and it's not even on the menu.

They already know how bad their service is normally that they already included 15% service charge for a table of 4; no signage on their menus or anywhere displayed (Surprise!!)

Food was adequate: 3 stars
Service was sub-par for America: 1 star 
Total: 2 stars

I didn't even want to take any photos as I was utterly disappointed after glowing reviews from someone I should have questioned when it came to Asian cuisine.

Not sure my review will matter to most, but be careful fellow Asian authentic eaters.

Kudo's to Joe for his business acumen to get the NYC masses to dine/takeout there... he's definitely doing something right but didn't do it for me.",0
"Long wait at 9 pm on a Saturday night approx. 35 min. Seating is family style (12 people) which was WEIRD to me, but fun.

Dumplings are 8 for $5, so get a bunch of them. They're pretty money. If I got a do-over, I'd just get a ton of dumplings and call it a night.

I wanted to get a beef and bean curd entree, but I was told it would be a while. Since I was starving, I ordered the beef and broccoli for $11. The generous portion was great, and the food was decent, but nothing more.

It was a good experience, but I won't be coming back. $20 can go way farther with Chinese food.",0
"Eh. I don't get the hype. 

Interior: 3/5
The restaurant may be small but the ambiance sure was busy and loud! It has the family vibe of a dim sum place but for Shanghainese food. Nonetheless, they still had American pop playing near the front of the store. 

Service: 5/5
Surprisingly, we were quickly seated for a party of around 8 on a weekday during lunch hours. Despite the workers rushing around all the tables, they still gave us their undivided attention, taking our orders and picking up empty dishes. 

Food- 
Value: 2/5
They have a large assorted menu but the dishes are pretty expensive for the quality and size! Disappointed. 

Pork Soup Dumplings: 3/5
Compared to other places, the soup is flavorful! They sure pack a plentiful punch in one dumpling! However, that was the only thing that stood out the most to me. Otherwise, they're pretty mediocre. 

Scallion Pancake: 5/5
Soooo good and definitely recommend! Bless they were served super warm and chewy!

Shanghai (?) Pan Fried Noodles w/ Chicken: 2/5
The noodles were...interesting. Had that similar taste to that Chinese rice krispie snack, sachima. 

Pan Fried Noodles w/ Pork: 4/5
These are the noodles I was used to! Oily, but definitely had that fresh off the wok taste that I enjoy! I'd say this is a safe staple to order! 

Beef Rice Cake: 1/5
The rice cakes were such a disappointment! They fall flat, in that they were too soft and floury. I definitely had better elsewhere. 

Service was fast! But other than that, I would not be going back here for their Shanghainese food.",0
"Unfortunately, this place is all hype. I guess I set my expectation level too high when I had heard about this place from friends. I can get better noodles and soup dumplings in Edison. Lots of foot traffic - the place gets very crowded. Cash only and gratuity is already included in the bill. Again, the food is decent; I've just had better. The soup dumplings barely had any soup in them. The ratio for noodles and sauce for the cold noodles was off.",0
"It's  good Chinese . The soup dumplings are tasty. All of the usual Chinese dishes you expect. All of it is good. 
Very crowded but line moves quickly. Slurp up those soup dumplings, and move on. Not much on atmosphere or friendliness.  People still leave happy.",0
"I had to come to one of the most popular soup dumpling restaurants in Chinatown. This place was super crowded on a Saturday evening. We had to wait over an hour to get seated even though the restaurant is pretty large. The service was pretty fast once we got seated.

We ordered the classic pork meat soup dumplings for $8. They were very good and hot. I still don't think they were worth the wait though. There are plenty of soup dumpling restaurants in Chinatown that are just as good. We also got spicy pepper salt calamari for $17 which was good but I wish it was crispier. We also got shanghai egg noodles stir-fried with beef for $17. There were so many noodles and beef.

Overall, the portion size of everything was large, but I don't think the food was amazing compared to other food available around it. There are so many good restaurants with no wait in Chinatown.",0
"theres a lot of hype for this place but for some reason i thought it was just ok. the line to get in is totally ridiculous. we waited for about an hour wc is totally fine with me. the line of people waiting outside was crazy! and when they call out someones number people jump up and cheer like they just won the lottery. hahaha. it was funny. 
inside, its a typical chinese restaurant. lazy susans galore. the pork and crab soup dumplings were good but not like oh emm gee amazing. tasted like any other dumpling ive had. and the other dishes we had like gen tsaos chicken and i think sweet and sour chicken were also alright. same as any chinese place. so overall i thought it was a pretty average chinese restaurant. idk if its wortht he long line outside.",0
"Heard about this place many time from friends and family so finally decided to try out during my trip to NYC.

Even though we were told that the wait would be about 15 min.  We ended up waiting for 45 min.  Later, I was told by others that this was actually not bad for a party of 6.
People with a party of 2 seemed to be getting their tables way before us.  

As soon as we sat down after 45 minute-wait, we were told to hurry up and order because food'll take long time to come out.  Well, food came out pretty fast.  We realized, they just wanted people to hurry up and order, eat and leave so they can sit the next customers.

Ordered the famous soup dumplings - 2 different kind.  It was okay.  It wasn't spectacular in any sense.  It was just so so.  Other food items were just okay too.  

Scallion Pancake and Eggplant with Garlic Sauce were actually pretty good.
Shanghai noodle soup was so salty.
Moo shu pork and kung pao chicken were mediocre.

Don't know why this place is so popular and packed.  It was just plain ol chinese restaurant.  Oh well, live and learn.  

I would probably not visit this place again because food was mediocre and service is pretty much non-existent.",0
"Waited too long for a mostly average Chinese ""tourist"" menu. Soup dumplings, the house specialty, were hit or miss on this most recent visit (half our double order were dry inside). Fast & friendly service once you're finally seated, but count the change carefully when paying your cash-only bill. The restaurant's ""ego wall"" collage of reviews and kudos is sadly dated and out-of--touch with the present tense.",0
I didn't enjoy the food overall.  Maybe the Singapore Rice Noodle dish was the best of the items ordered.  Most lacked taste.,0
"Completely average, nothing to rave about and certainly not worth the newly found long waits due to yelp overhype. The soups dumplings are good but not worth waiting for.",0
"The crab and pork soup dumplings are great.  The skins are very thin and lots of delicious savory soup to slurp up.  However, the other dishes were mediocre and greasy. The shredded beef had 2/3 celery and carrots, and barely a 1/3 beef.  The seafood fried noodles had a gooey dark sauce instead the usual light white sauce.  It was disappointing. So, really the only thing I would order here are the soup dumplings.",0
"We came here because of many recommendations from friends who live in the city. Coming from Toronto, I guess I'm pretty spoiled in terms of authentic chinese food. I found the dumplings are very delicious and well done. We felt rushed though. The waiter basically was hurrying us along to order then threw us the bill the moment we finished eating. It was a bit unpleasant. Not sure if I will ever come back here again when I visit NYC",0
"If you lived in California and like Din Tai Fung then don't bother coming here !

Overall service is 2 stars with surprisingly good service as American standard place.",0
"I used to come here during college and once in a while after college.  At the time, the soup dumplings here seemed to be unrivaled by competitors and had no equal.  I came here two weeks ago looking to redeem myself from what had to be the 'worst.xlb.ever.'in Chicago.  It had been three years since my last visit to Joe's Shanghai and the wait for a seat was still as long as ever, but would the food still be as good?

I have to tell you, the food wasn't as good as I remembered.  The xiao long baos weren't as steaming hot and soupy as they were in the past.  Even the dumpling skin seemed to be lacking.  I think we have a serious quality control problem here.  They weren't as bad as the ones I had in Chicago's Chinatown, but still, average at best.  Maybe since this place is so established with tourists, it no longer has to try as hard.  I am greatly disappointed.  Even the tong cai greens I ordered were disappointing.  Half of the greens were wilted.

If I ever visit NY's Chinatown again and want XLB, I know where not to go.  For you locals, it's not worth the wait, go somewhere else.  I now dub this place tourist trap!",0
"I think I had much higher expectations given the reviews. The soup dumplings were good, but I had better dumplings elsewhere. As other reviewers stated, many of the dumplings leaked even before we tried to lift. The dumplings are bigger than other places, which actually makes it harder to eat and fit in the spoon. Having said that, all their portions are generous and prices are very reasonable, so no complaints there. The salt pepper pork is very salty; the scallion pancakes are very good though. All in all, a pretty decent meal at a reasonable price. Cash only, gratuities are included to the bill.",0
"The queuing system is a complete mess. We were told that our wait would be an hour. When they called our number, they asked if everyone is here yet. We said not yet, and they told us that they would not give us the table until everyone is here. Once we have everyone, we asked again how much longer is the wait. The girl told us another hour. That was after we waited for an hour!  No apology or whatsoever. Staff are rude. We saw other parties coming in and checking on their waiting time, and many of them also complained that they have already waited for an hour or so, and were told to wait for another hour.

Go somewhere else unless you have the whole day standing in line, and make sure your whole party is here.

Food is average, you can get better dumpling somewhere else",0
Food was mediocre at best. Everything we ordered was greasy (crab and pork soup dumplings and the worst string beans I've ever had). Shanghai noodles were the only decent thing we had. Don't waste your time at this tourist trap.,0
Soup dumplings were good but not great - the skin was a bit too thick and dry. Don't order their fried dumplings or cong you bing; they're really greasy and ordinary.,0
The line is always super long for this place but that's okay. I waited about 10 minutes for a table for 2. Though the food was quickly served the only downside about this place is the waiters are super rude and they honestly don't give a damn.,0
Please change your business hours. It says 11pm but I arrived at 9:50pm and was turned away,0
"Not sure what the hype is all about. People who raved about their XLB, probably never had DTF, which still holds the best XLB in my opinion.  We ordered the pork and crab dumplings. The dumpling's skin was too thick, and it was way too big. The soup inside of the crab dumpling was greasy. I was not impressed at all, I've had better, way better.

Came here before noon on Friday and expected to wait. But we were seated as right away. Not even gonna mention service because I'm in Chinatown so I don't expect any. Thank goodness we didn't have to wait. Otherwise, I felt I would be ripped off in taste and time!",0
"Semi-authentic, Americanized Chinese food. I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and it was great. Wife and kids ordered General Tso and sesame chicken and there wasn't much chicken in it, mostly batter. The hot and sour soup was awesome! They only take cash. It was pretty expensive, especially for lunch. I would probably walk around and try a place with less than $9 lunch menus outside and try that.",0
"This place is toristy trap, foods okay, service could be better. They seem to want to rush you out of there, definitely not a place for catching up with peeps.",0
"I have been eating here for 20 years. Today the soup dumplings were off, they were cold and had little flavor. On top of that prices went up on dumplings and beer. They charge 15% tip and then tax you on 15% tip. Doesn't seem legal. 
Very disappointed today and very sick at stomach this evening.",0
Classic Americanized Chinese food. Decent soup dumplings but worth stopping in if you're looking for good Chinese in Manhattan!,0
"I have mixed feelings about this place. Bear with me...


The wait wasn't long and they're quick to get you seated. You will be seated with other people, so fair warning. This doesn't bother me as I've dined in places like this before. When you're given the menu, you feel a bit rushed. I wasn't sure about some menu items, so as I questioned the waiter he seemed annoyed that I wasn't familiar with the dishes. He then brought me a menu with pictures so I was able to order. All the items come family style, so 2 people can easily share a meal. My husband had ordered the crispy duck, which the waiter forgot to enter. All the food came out little by little which was irritating because some people finished before others. What's worse, when the food came out I kindly asked the waiter which chicken this was and he ignored me. The reason I asked him was because he placed it in front of the wrong person. I asked another waiter and he was also irritated by my question. We ordered a fried rice to share which came out at the end. 

The food was delicious. I had the Shanghai beef noodles, my daughter had the sesame chicken which was also amazing, and my dad had the crispy beef. The pork fried rice was out of this world. The kung pao chicken wasn't all that great, it was our least favorite. Can't tell you how the crispy duck was. We also ordered the pork soup dumplings as an appetizer to share and they were delicious. 

So food = above average. Service = sucked. If it wasn't for the crappy service, I would rate this place 4 stars. They were extremely rude and I left dinner really irritated. Hope this helps.",0
"Not to much I can add to what has already been said about this place.  Yes, the Soup Dumplings are outstanding and a must have.  I have had them twice...once to go (not the easiest thing to eat while walking but we managed) and once at a sit down.  Typical Chinatown communal dining.  The night we ate there, we shared a table with a couple from LA and their local hosts who were kind enough to offer us taste of their dishes when we admired them. The shanghai casserole was excellent and the salt and pepper shrimp were just about perfect.  But be forewarned, this place gets crowded  and there is often a wait.  Which only means..its worth it!",0
"Went for Father's Day which probably contributed to a lower rating since I wanted to have a conversation with my Dad which did not involve a bunch of strangers - seating is ""family style"".  Waiters are quick (efficient) but do not adhere to convention when serving - had their arm in front of my face more than once.  Food itself is okay but nothing spectacular.  I had noodles with peanut sauce - too much peanut.  Beef and green beans - less meat, more beans (though they were good).  Steamed crab dumplings were supposed to be ""amazing"".  I was not amazed.",0
"Soup dumplings are tasty, but the rest of the fare is nothing special.",0
Such a disappointment. Soup dumplings were too fatty and the meat wasn't good. Pan fried noodles were really gross and there was mold on some of the vegetables. They also pre-included the tip in the bill. Shanghai cafe is 100 times better!!! SHANGHAI CAFE for the win.,0
this is a worst restaurant . the food very very salty and the server so bad. I never come here again,0
"Pork soup dumplings were flavorful and there was a decent amount of soup in the dumplings. I thought the skins were a little thick compared to what I'm used to in San Francisco. The soup was good though. I haven't had it at any other NY restaurants so I can't really compare it to anywhere else in NY. But, I can say that it was good. 

It makes me want to get some when I get back to SF after my trip! 

But overall, a decent experience. 

Tip: If you dont want to wait, order for pick-up and eat the order outside fresh! (what we did) Definitely was just as good as in a bustling restaurant. And if you want to eat at the restaurant, be prepared to wait. There were plenty of people waiting. So, start heading over before you're hungry to compensate the wait.",0
"I wish I had done more research and realized that the dim sum (and all other plates for that matter) cannot be ordered in small portions here. So, we had the crab and pork soup dumplings because that seemed to be the must-have there. We would not have known how to eat them had we not been seated at an 8 top with a party of 6 Japanese tourists who seemed to know how to enjoy these pockets of fun. You use the soup spoon to take them out of the large bamboo steamer, pour the black vinegary sauce sitting on the table over them, then use your chopsticks to puncture them and let the rich broth drip onto your spoon. YUM! We also had some noodles that our waiter 9not the nicest guy on the planet) claimed to be the special (first ones on the menu) and they were good, not mindblowing. A couple of Shing Tao beers and that was enough food for the both of us. If you don't require super friendly service or refuse to sit with other people and not in the mood to sample lots of smaller plates and have CASH, then you might like this place. Next time we're in Chinatown, we'll look for cart service which I saw is actually a filter in Yelp!",0
"I'm wavering between 2 and 3 stars but I'll stick with the 3 because I actually enjoyed the salt and pepper pork chops and green onion pancakes (not what they're known for).  This a just OK restaurant and I know there are better options in this same vicinity.  I think this is a perfect example of the downfalls of being a restaurant that's heavily listed in Trip Advisor, Travel books (Lonely Planet) and food blogs.  They are very advertised and the quality of the food is just not there, especially with their most famous XLBs.

We ordered their famous pork xiao long bao (shanghai soup dumplings) as well as the salt and pepper pork chops and green onion pancakes.  The XLBs are quite large but the skins were tough, the soup inside was thick and greasy and the meat was not as flavorful as I hoped.  We were sat with another couple at our table and without expressing our feelings, they let us know that they've had better dumplings in other places as well.  But, despite my disappointment, I do admit that I very much enjoyed their salt and pepper pork chops.  They were crunchy, hot and well flavored.  The green onion pancakes were also very well prepared and ate every single piece.  But, unfortunately people aren't looking for these items and would have to say you should look to other places for XLBs. 

Nearby I would recommend walking just a couple of blocks away to Shanghai Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-caf%C3%A9-new-york-2 although there are many other terrific options in Flushing.",0
"Really deserves 3 out of 5. 
Don't go there expecting too much or you'll be sorely disappointed... 
Also do try the red bean dessert!",0
"The soup dumplings are legit. There's a reason why there's always 30+ people standing outside waiting to eat. The rest of the food, however, is comparable to your local Chinese delivery joint. Gorge yourself on dumplings and skip everything else.",0
Over hyped and over priced.  We ordered many dishes.  None of them were special. They were average to bad.  Noticed there were no Asian customers except us.,0
"Tourist restaurant = long lines = long wait time

Pros:
-Come here for the the pork soup dumplings. All the other dishes are mediocre - you can get it at almost any authentic Chinese restaurant close to half the price.

Cons:
-Due to the long lines, they rush you out of the place. So if you're trying to have a group gathering and need to chat - this is NOT the place to go. 
-Weird seating arrangements
-Pricey compared to nearby restaurants",0
"2 FOR FLAVOR! Minus 3 stars for cleanliness and service.

The place is carpeted and stinks like mildew and dirty feet, and the restaurant overall is FILTHY, as well as what you can see of the kitchen from the bathroom line. I know Chinatown doesn't have exactly the best reputation for cleanliness, but a touristy place like this really has no excuse.

Our server seemed completely annoyed with us, and we were very straight forward and were an easy group. You also will have to share a table w other people - something to be aware of.

The soup dumplings were good, and the shirmp on top of crispy noodle was also delicious!
I wouldn't say they are using the best quality of ingredients, but it's tasty.",0
"I've been to Joe's Shanghai a few times years ago but stopped going because of the long wait.  (FYI - the Joe's Ginger down the street is operated by the same people/owner, and on par with Joe's SH in terms of food quality if not better.  I always go there since it's usually a much shorter wait and a LOT less tourists.)  Recently we took our visiting friend there, since her friends in california all recommended her to try Joe's SH.  As expected, there was a line and we waited about 45 min.  They placed the 5 of us on a big round table, which we had to share with another group of 4.  I'm not a big fan of sharing tables, but had to comply since we were all starving and didn't want to wait another half an hr for our own table.

We ordered both pork soup dumplings and crab flavored soup dumplings.  They came out decent - hot and steamy and definitely had a lot of soup inside the buns.  However the skin/peel isn't great, still a bit on the thick side.  We ordered a few other Shanghainese dishes (I grew up in Shanghai), including a fish head casserole, braised pork shoulder, and a few other veggie dishes, but none of them were amazing.  Especially the braised pork shoulder - it's supposed to be juicy and flavorful, but it came out to be extremely dry and hard to chew.  It was almost like eating pork jerky.  Not cool.  Don't think I'll be back again any time soon.",0
"Longstanding Chinese restaurant doling out favorites in a cafeteria-like atmosphere. Saturday afternoon, was able to get a seat at a large communal table without any wait. 

Most of the main dishes are on the expensive side as they are family-style. Since I didn't have a family with me, I opted instead for the Spring Roll ($2.75) and the Pork Soup Dumplings ($8). While waiting, you are served green tea that's piping hot and good for the stomach. Spring roll is served with a side of soy sauce and stuffed with shrimp and pork. Found it to be overly greasy and not well balanced. The flavor of the shrimp was the saving grace. Soup dumplings come shortly after, several steamed pieces served with soy sauce and ginger. Again, flavor is a little dull - could have used some more spices for the added kick. Towards the last few the dumplings got much colder, so didn't finish the last two.

Servers come around often to make sure they get people in and out quickly. Not a fan of the automatic gratuity to go along with cash-only policies (especially since the main courses are more expensive).",0
"Came here bc of number of reviews but was underwhelmed unfortunately....it was packed yet the quality of what we had was overrated.

I had Gen Tso chicken 
Fried rice
Pork soup dumplings 
Spicy shrimp 

All were just good, with number of reviews we expected to see Jesus walk on water. 

We had to share a table with two other parties, which was fine...

I've had better quality taste, texture, freshness from my local Chinese takeout place in Palm Beac",0
"COUNT YOUR CHANGE!!!!  The cashier tried to stiff the person ahead of me.  He gave the cashier $20.00.  The bill was under $10.  She gave him $3 change.  He complained and thereafter she gave him the correct change.

I went to pay for my take out meal and handed a $20.00 bill.  My meal was about $6.80.  I was handed $3.20.  I told the cashier that I handed her a $20.00.  She chuckled and gave me back an additional $10.00.

Businesses like this can't last too long when they really couldn't care less who is behind the cash register.",0
"2+ hr wait? No thank you.

GO NEXT DOOR TO JOE'S GINGER!!! Virtually no wait and, surprise, its owned by the same owner as Joe's Shanghai!

Besides, J Shanghai's dumplings are overrated: oily soups and thick, chewy skin. Be adventurous and check out more unknown places in the neighborhood; theyre guaranteed to be better.",0
Price gouging !! Price went up 30% within 2 years not going here anymore. They illegally add 18% tip for a party of 4 and try to mask it by calling it a service charge.,0
"Having grown up in LA, I've had more than my fair share of Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) and Shanghainese food. I was really disappointed and expected more from this place considering the crowd and the reviews! 

Came here on a Friday night around 8pm. Huge crowd outside the door with a 40 minute wait time. Luckily for a party of 2, it was a little faster so we got in within 20-30 minutes. Like the other reviews have mentioned, smaller parties get put into communal tables. 

We had an order of xiao long bao, scallion pancake and pan fried noodles with chicken. The dumplings were good but definitely not the best I've had (If you're ever in LA you need to go to Din Tai Fung). The scallion pancakes were probably the best thing. The pan fried noodles were not at all what I was expecting and it ended up taking 20 minutes AFTER we had finished the dumplings for them to come out. 

Not surprising the service wasn't great (based on other reviews we didn't expect it to be) and the place was dirty and cramped. I'm not picky on locale so long as the food is authentic. This place is decent BUT definitely overrated. I would consider going back but not until after I've tried a few other place to decide if it really is ""the best in the city.""

Don't forget: cash only!",0
"The soup dumplings here are good, but not great. The other aspects of eating here (e.g. long line) make it not really worth it.",0
Definitely overrated. XLB's are thick skinned and the broth is just grease. Rest of the food's passable but can hardly be considered Shanghainese.,0
"I know, this is on every NY list. Take the visitors. Show off the amazing Shanghainese cuisine. But honestly, I've had so many better soup dumpling that maybe I'm not doing this right.

It's fine, and challenging the conventional wisdom is risky, but I'm still waiting to see what's so incredible here. Perhaps I need to keep trying (I will). Maybe it peaked already and is coasting downhill for a bit?But my impression has been that you can do a lot better.",0
Great soup dumplings! Didn't really enjoy the fried rice and other entrees we ordered.,0
"When I got into the restaurant, I knew there was something wrong. The restaurant was full but over 90% of customers were not Chinese. This kind of restaurant is usually over-rated by those non-Chinese customers who have never been to China. As a Chinese, I know only those restaurants with over 50% Chinese customers are worth the visit. 
But I still tried their best selling food - soup dumplings. It was good but not excellent. I would have given them 3 stars based on the soup dumplings. But the other foods we ordered were so disappointing. The turnip cake was bad and the fried noodle was very very very horrible.
I hope the post can give a warning to other Chinese customers. I know the non-Chinese customers enjoy the food. My comments might not be valid to them.",0
"Had to try the Pork Xiao Long Bao and I must say...it was good!! I can't say it's THE BEST but definitely tasty. I'm actually not a big fan of dumplings like that but I decided to give it a try since everyone was talking about it. Definitely was a good and I'm coming back tommorw before I head home just for the XLB. Turnip cake was not good at all. Try the fried pork, it was actually good as well. It winter right now so good gets cold easily so I wish the pork stayed hot longer but the flavor was good. Had the Crab & Pork Bao too and it's very similar tasting to the pork. I would get both to try and taste the difference. Pricing is very affordable $5.95 for their XLB. ""Service Charge"" AKA tip is already added to the bill.  Service is crappy as in almost any Asian restaurant in Chinatown so I wasn't expecting much per usual but I thought it was funny. Kinda rushed us out so they can get the next crowd in. Again expected I guess.",0
"I'm done with this place. It's been mediocre for quite a few years but today the best of the dishes (salt & pepper shrimp; pork soup dumplings) could most charitably be described as mediocre, while the rest of it (scallops & prawns with garlic sauce; kung pao chicken) was revolting. The scallops & prawns was particularly disgusting -- salty and fishy tasting to the point of being inedible and, at $31, a rip-off. What's nastier than foul-tasting, stanky seafood?  This place has gone from good (in the 1990s and 00s), to hit-or-miss, to consistently mediocre, to consistently bad.

I've probably eaten here over 100 times since it first opened in the 1990s. The wait staff used to be friendly and the food was pretty good. It's mostly gross now and I have no desire to eat there again.",0
"The most expensive Shanghainese food in Chinatown, and yet not the best , I live in Chinatown and ate there once with my friends. Never again , at that time they even charge you for the tea, (the only Shanghainese restaurant in Chinatown that charge ) 
Most of their customers are tourist , you don't see locals eating there.",0
"came for the soup dumplins. we did a take out order, so they suffered a little, not a lot of soup bu they come with the authentic black vinegar",0
"Coming from the SF Bay Area with tons of yummy Asian food, I have to say Joe's Shanghai is definitely waaay over-rated. 

We ordered the Pork & Crab XLB - I took one bite and couldn't finish.  The flavor was meh.  The dumpling filling did not taste fresh, but instead was super fishy in my opinion.    

We also ordered some veggies (kong xin cai) and the cold sesame noodles.  The veggies were okay/standard.  The noodles were luke warm and texture wise were kind of mooshy.  

Considering this place had 4000 reviews, 4+ stars, I was expecting some damn good Chinese food or at least some yummy XLB.  Sad to say, Joe's Shanghai was way below expectations.",0
"Living in Chinatown throughout all my life I'm pretty sure I can identify which restaurants are authentic and which restaurants aren't. Joes Shanghai has been one of the most overrated places ever. Im glad the restaurant is doing well and I hope they continue their success. Many of the local people in Chinatown usually don't eat here because it doesn't taste as good as other Shanghai restaurants and the line here is just long. I can name you 3 other shanghai restaurants in Chinatown that taste 10x better! Sorry Joes, I don't like the restaurant but I don't hate it as well.",0
"I hope that you've been able to enjoy Joe's Shanghai in the past when their soup dumplings were amazing because sadly their popularity has gotten the better of them and they're simply not of the same quality.  You used to have to wait because the soup dumplings were made fresh but even if you sat and waited 20 minutes you waited eagerly knowing you were in a for a delight.  However, the soup dumplings are pre-made now so they really aren't the same.  

I used to go to Joe's and stuff myself with a dozen dumplings and walk around in a happy food coma as their soupy goodness filled my being.  Unfortunately, after having their dumplings recently I don't think I'd bother ever again.",0
"To be honest, from all these reviews I thought this place was going to be AMAZING. It was just okay.. 

Got the shanghai dumplings, pork dumplings, greenbeans, and some noodle dish.. I don't remember the name because it was that bland.

It was nothing special for all the hype.",0
"Being a soup dumpling fan, read Joe's Shanghai's positive reviews and decided to check it out with a friend, new to them. Ordered the Crab and Pork Soup Dumplings  (a.k.a. Xiao Long Baos) which were extremely big. That being said, their huge size, the inadequately sized spoon and lack of bowl to eat them over made them difficult and sloppy to get down. The flavor also did not match those of the recently closed former Grand Sichuan on W 24th & 9th - where their's was one of my favorites.

We also ordered half a Peking duck, which was served with half the boneless meat with skin on one plate, the boned meat on another, a small saucer of sauce, four pancakes to wrap, plus a plate of scallion and cucumbers. The slices on the boneless plate were more skin and fat than meat. The boned meat place required a lot of work. More importantly the sauce and pancakes were inadequate given the level of meat. It required about 6-8 pancakes for the half and a larger bowl with sauce. Paying for any extra pancakes, given the level of duck, seems not right given the price.

If you're longing for soup dumplings, there has to be better places out there in NYC.

ALERT! - Be aware of the automatic ""Service Fee"" they add to your bill - even for parties of 2 - if you don't want to double tip!",0
"from a recommendation, we took our parents to joe's shanghai to eat the infamous dumplings. honestly, it was just ok. it wasn't a horrible experience and the food was okay--i just don't think the food was so amazing that it warranted the almost hour wait. the crispy beef however was quite delicious!",0
"The place was too crowded. We knew the food was gonna be good but there isn't a really good energy because people are just constantly watching you eat, waiting for you to get out of your seat. It was pretty stressful eating here, especially with the tight spaces, and the waiter barely came to our table, which wasn't too great.

We went a second time and after 20 minutes, just ended up going to Shanghai Gourmet down the street. It was smaller but ten times better in experience and the food was priced at an awesome bargain for the value we got.",0
"First time I came here: Soup dumplings were fantastic.

That was two years ago. Revisited this place with a relative who isn't from New York so I thought I'd take her here. The dumplings weren't fresh, the dumpling skin was overly floury and stale and the broth was not so great.

Annoying wait in smelly ass Chinatown. 

What happened to THIS PLACE",0
"I love Xiao Long Bao (Shanghainese soup dumplings)... but Joe's was just ok - good/not bad for if you're craving, but nothing worth crazy fanfare. 

For a party of 2 who came around 1PM, we got seated almost instantly but at a communal 10-person round table. This is no high class dining establishment... here you sit, you eat, you pay, and you leave - its a well oiled machine with fast (and too focused to pay attention to service) servers to match.

We got an order of pan fried pork dumplings, cold noodles in sesame sauce, and pork soup dumplings. Fried dumplings were standard, the noodles were nothing special, and imo the xlb falls short of LA's Din Tai Fung... The broth was nice and hot, but the skin and meat didn't wow me... My fave US XLB still goes to SF's Shanghai Dumpling King, but when in NY, I suppose Joe's is worth a go if you're looking for xiao long bao.",0
"Horrible service, food was great but the service just made the visit horrible. So if you want horrible service but great food then by all means food is great.",0
"Look- I love a hype. I know it is usually overrated but I still love restaurants that are hyped up. I find them fun. 

I walked into Joe's solo and got seated right away (SHOCK) I have been to nyc many times and eaten many different kinds of soup dumplings but never at Joe's. FINALLY I GOT TO TRY JOE'S.

I went in, got the chicken on the special list and also the soup dumps. The dumps are big. They are not soupy inside but more gravy like. While hot it was not bad, when it got room temp. It was actually kind of gross. The chicken was actually really good. Everything was on the expensive side, but like I said- I like a hype and am use to the price. 

I am giving one star because I really didn't like the soup dumplings... Like I would avoid them to be honest. The chicken was good but the rice was burnt! How can a Chinese place have burnt rice??? I didn't love the place. I am totally fine with bad service if that is the vibe of the place, but for these prices it is sort of not okay. 

Okay what really ticked me is they added an 18% service charge. I don't mind. I usually tip higher then that regardless so no big deal. I left another few dollars because that was the change I had. 

The treated me awful after I left the tip and even yeah ""hey!"" super meanly when I tried to leave. I turned around and asked if something was wrong? He said ""oh nothing."" Then in Chinese I heard him bitch about my tip.... I am so confused. I googled and googled to see if there was an extremely high 18% service tax in nyc and if I was suppose to tip more? I asked my nyc friends. No one understands what happened....

Look- I would not skip this place because again I love a hype but the soup dumplings really aren't that good.",0
"The food is outstanding. But the servers were so rude they killed all my mood both the times I was there. My friend tried to order a wonton soup once, and I think they misheard her somehow, the server told her to order something from the menu.
The second time we went there, we tried to order a spicy soup. In the bottom of every page of the menu says that we can modify the spiciness, so we said ""make it not too spicy please"". Though I showed them the words printed in the menu, they argued with us, told us to order something else that is not spicy at all because ""they can't do that"". 

This place is tourist-packed, too. I wish they were just a little nicer, because I do come back to places for the pleasant service they provide.",0
i think it's a lil over-rated. i like the other local joints and their xiao long bao. not big about sharing tables.,0
"Considering the wait and hype around this spot, it barely lived up to its expectation. I came in here on a Monday afternoon with a party of 2 and we were seated in about 10 minutes (not bad but other parties had to wait about 20-35 minutes). Ofc we had already planned out what to order. Pork soup dumplings, crab and pork soup dumplings, and Shanghai thick noodles. For a place that specializes in XLB's I expected to get the food in a matter of a few minutes. Over 10 minutes later our soup dumplings came and I'm not sure if it's just me but I'm not a big fan of the bok choi under the soup dumplings (I think they're used to prevent the dumplings from sticking to the traditional paper that other places use so the dumplings won't break upon contact). They get stuck on the dumplings and taste bland. The dumplings itself were alright (definitely had better in flushing and even the neighboring 21 Shanghai). The crab soup dumplings were stuffed very densely and was definitely better IMO than the pork soup dumplings. The Shanghai noodles were nothing special (very greasy too). The bill came out about 29 for 2 people so it's definitely not too pricey but was it worth the hype and wait? Naaaaah",0
"Allow me to tell you that I am never coming back here again. As much as I love xiao long biao, the fact that you actually came back and demanded I pay you the fucking 11 cents that I was short from the 15% TIP was WAYYYYYYYYY too much for me to handle. 

Not to mention the complete lack of real chinese food. Hunan/sesame chicken?  Overly salted string beans? Overpriced and NOT worth even 5 bucks in my book.

Good bye.",0
"Good soup dumplings are hard to come by in The Netherlands, so I made sure to pay this place a visit on my US trip. We came here right before opening time on a Sunday and managed to snatch the only table for two (next to the entrance and a Halloween-decorated fish tank). The food was ordered quickly (waiters do speak English if necessary) and then the waiting game started. 

The first dish that came out were the Shanghai noodles (~12 min). Oily but yummy. Then the scallion pancakes. Also pretty good. And lastly, 20 min after we ordered, the pork soup dumplings. Don't they have some of these steaming before they open, knowing everyone will want them? 

The dumplings are big, they won't fit in your spoon without overspilling. The dough was thicker than I'm used to. And they sure are soupy. Verdict: meh, I've had better. 

All in all, okay place to get your soup dumpling fix but only if there's no line.",0
"It's been my understanding this place has turned more into a tourist trap than a venerable food place. That's probably true since we shared a round table with two groups of Frenchies.

However, it's undeniable that their food is still cheap and good.  Their hearty soup dumplings are twice the size of Ding Tai Fong's but they win because 1) You can never get any at DTF due to limited availability and 2) You pay more for less there.  DTF definitely has a more refined product but if you want down and dirty, Joe's is the place to be.

We also had their green onion pancake - greasy but good - and their zasai and mustard green noodles.  The default noodles were mushy and had no bite but the broth was tasty, though not complex or rich like that which is used in Japanese ramen.

Service is brisk and the place COULD be cleaner.  But like the mom and kid who also shared a table with us, you can get out of there full spending less than $10.  SERVICE CHARGE OF 15% IS ALREADY INCLUDED IN EVERYONE'S TAB!!! (another sign of a tourist trap)",0
"Soup dumplings were good. Shanghai noodles were way too greasy, but they always are. 

Ugh the low reviews are because they charge a mandatory gratuity, doesn't matter how big your party is and the waitstaff are not pleasant. It's like they know they are getting tipped no matter what so why try to be a nice server.",0
"This is a well-known restaurant for Soup Dumplings, so there will always be a long line outside waiting for a table. If you come in a small group, most likely you will end up sharing a table with some people. I didn't think their soup dumplings were that great.  They were VERY greasy. Also, I don't like the seating arrangements. Another issue we encountered was that we found TWO HAIRS in our food (and in separate dishes)!. One thick greasy hair was in the center of our rice cake dish, and another one was actually WRAPPED INSIDE of a soup dumpling.  It was gross! We won't eat in here again.",0
Not so hot. Pricey and long wait. Servers are hard to understand. Soup dumpling--I had better on the west coast.,0
"I've been here 2 times now- once a few years ago and once tonight.  I think the soup dumplings used to be bigger!! But- they seem a little more authentic now.  This place has the soup-iest dumplings I have ever had! And I've had a lot of them- in Shanghai, in CA, at Din Tai Fung in both China and the US.  The pork ones are better than the crab ones.  Save your money and don't splurge on crab. They're meh. 

I didn't think the rest of their food spectacular.  Their beef noodle soup is decent- I like the noodles!  I love ham and winter melon soup so when I saw it on the menu, of course I ordered it.  What came out was TOTALLY not what I expected.  The Shanghai-nese version of this soup is a clear broth with large chunks of winter melon and small slices of virginia ham.  What they served was some mixture of egg drop soup, with frozen peas and carrots, luncheon meat, and small cubes of winter melon.  I mean it wasn't terrible I suppose, but it definitely was not what I was craving.  The scallion pancakes were ok- a little too greasy and over fried but the sweet soy dipping sauce bit was a nice touch.  

Don't expect to have a private meal here, or even your own table.  Both times I've been, we've been seated at a communal table with others.  It's really not that bad though.  Sometimes it's fun to talk to other people.  Tonight, we were the only Chinese people at the table and someone we got all our food first and started chomping down.  It was a little awkward when the rest of the table was just staring at us eating while hungrily envying us but such is life.  Pays to be Chinese sometimes! 

I would go back but maybe just stick to eating soup dumplings and maybe the beef noodle soup (which is only about $5 for a good sized bowl!).",0
"These three stars were for the food.
Good food but terrible service. Some wOne of the guy looks like to be the supervisor give me attitude when asked for help saying why would I ask him to collet the empty dish while there's another waiter was around? How would I know who's serving me especially he's the one place my orders for food, so I assumed I can ask for help from him.",0
"Went here instead of my usual place Shanghai Asian Manor, and I was so disappointed with the food quality. The meat in the soup dumplings was full of gristle and made them hard to eat. Also ordered the General Tso's chicken and I honestly can't say with confidence that the meat was chicken. Go to Shanghai Asian Manor instead!",0
"waited for way too long even though we put our names down (2h?)
food was good, got crispy veg noodles, dumplings, and green beans
did not get orange slices at the end :(
wouldn't get the crispy noodles again, beans were standard, and so were dumplings. 
would not wait again",0
"Overrated.  
Tried their crab and pork dumplings with scallion pancake. Too salty and very greasy. 
:/",0
"Place is very crowded. We had to ask people who were eating to get up from their seats to get to ours.
Waiters were behaving like they had a train to catch. He was in such a hurry to take our order that he had to come back two times to ask what exactly we ordered.
Talking about the food. It seems like they get a lot of oil and broccoli for free. Our food was full of it. At the end we felt like that's all we hate. 
All in all for the amount of reviews this place has and the stars it has for us it was below average. 
I would not visit this place again unless something dramatically changed.",0
For the money he food was ok. The portions were a good size and the God was very good quality. However the meals don't come with rice or fortune cookies but they do give you tea. The staff was really nice as well.,0
"The food was good. We had the pork soup dumplings, pork fried rice and General Tso chicken.  I'm undecided about the soup dumplings. The rice and chicken tasted fresher than the local neighborhood spots but all in all it was a bit average.  The customer service was what you'll find I believe in most restaurants in the area. Typically no one is particularly friendly but not necessarily rude, they just get you in and get you out. I'd give the spot another try to sample other items on the menu. Oh and FYI seating is shared I suppose unless you have a large enough party to fill an entire table.",0
"I can't really decide between 3 or four stars... so 3.5?

I bookmarked Joe's shanghai after hearing from numerous friends on the west coast that this is a must try.

I live in LA is surrounded by Ding Tai Fung devotees.. here and there i hear from people that Joe's Shanghai is better..so I had to give it a try.

On a monday night around 8pm the place was packed. No reservations walk ins only. My friend arrived early and was able to grab a number (although they won't seat you until you're entire party is there).

Given how popular this place is, it's likely you'll be sharing a table with another party..which is kind of odd.. not my favorite way of dining with strangers right across the table from you.

Anyhow, the staff was quick to serve us..but it took them forever to request for anything else. Boo.

For the three of us we ordered the following

2x of the pork XLB
-they were definitely bigger than what i'm use to.
-upon biting the xlb, be careful! This particular one has lots of stock (soup) inside and it can get quite messy
-for me the skin (wrapping) was a tad bit too thick to my liking
-the meat was good and had good flavor, but the texture was a tad bit too mushy for my liking

scallion (green onion) pancake
-too oily! but some people like it this way
-not crispy enough for my taste buds

garlic sautéed green beans
-this i liked..and probably enjoyed the most.

So.. was it better than the SoCal contenders? eh.. Although the price was comparable ( a bit cheaper actually) I think in terms of the XLB i enjoy those at DTF(which isn't amazing either and overhyped as well) a bit more. It's more delicate and the flavor and texture combos work better. 

For that alone, I would probably say that the XLB places in CA are a better option, but of course..this is just MY opinion. 

Test it out with your tastebuds..and see how you feel.

"Place is known for their soup dumplings but it's just another Chinatown locale.  Just tasty, greasy, Chinese food.  The place is fairly dirty, needs to clean up a bit but what do you expect for Chinatown!  I would still recommend going there over other Chinese restaurants.",0
"this place is allllllll hypeeeee. totally a tourist spot. super disappointed. first of all, the dumplings didnt even look authentic. they were wayyyyy bigger than what they should look like. second, half of our dumplings broke when we picked up. they all stuck on the bottom. WTF!??@?@?!?!?!!!!!!!!! the taste was jus ok. we also order KAO FU, which is one of the most famous shanghai appetizer. ewwwwwwww, grooossss. ive experienced better even in boston. dun even compare to shanghai's soup dumplings. not even close. super long line, full of white ppl that dunno any better. if you see full of white ppl at any asian places, you should immediately know it's bad. avoid at all cost.",0
"I don't get it. The service was bad. The food quality was horrendous. The wait was long. Everyone said my dish was the best and I thought it was gross.. can't imagine how bad their food must have tasted. 

The Emperor Has No Clothes!",0
"This is where I feel in love with soup dumplings. And I must say they're dumplings areg ood, but I can't compare too many places though considering it was my first time having them. Got the crab and pork and another order of just pork. It was full of soup and flavor. And the dipping sauce was great.  Also got the turnip shortcake and it was crunchy and juicy.

The Singapore noodles wasn't exactly what I expected. I wasn't too fond of the flavor. I say stick to the dumplings.

It gets pretty packed and busy. They only have huge round tables so if you're not a big group you more likely share a table with a family or two. I think it's nice to talk and meet new people. Sat next to a woman who lead an interesting life. Traveled around the world and lives in the upper east side. You never know who you'll meet.",0
"Came here with Boo Boo after work on a Friday night. We we're lucky to be seated right away because it was just two. Unfortunately, we got seated at the small table by the entrance. 

We shared an order of soup dumplings, sesame noodles and scallion pancake. The pancake was way too greasy and may be commercially made. The noodles was okay but needed something. The soup dumplings we're good but I wanna say I'm not a fan of them. 

Boo Boo entree was salt and pepper shrimp. She liked them a lot but was full from our shared plates.

I ordered the fish head casserole. The bowl was huge and everyone stared at me as I was eating. Someone gave their name and took a look at me and shook his as he walked out to wait. The large fish tank I order was really good. It was earthy and herbally. It was took big and hot to enjoy at the small table we sat at. I finished it the next day for breakfast with noodles. 

I don't get the long line of this place. I will have to read up on bon appetit to figure out why this place is so great.",0
My boss and I both got sick. Terrible atmosphere and service.,0
"FIRST OFF CASH ONLY!! Listen if you want traditional and American style Chinese food that's super fresh then this is the place, but don't expect to come here and be blown away by the food. It's an upgraded version of your local hoods Chinese food because it's clean and fresh but overpriced for what it is. The restaurant is extremely over crowded. The ambiance is cool, but The tables are practically on top of each other. The service isn't great. The pan fried pork dumplings were ok, nothing crazy and dumplings is what they are known for. The General Tsos chicken was average but incredibly fresh. The sauce on it tasted off, but that's me I guess. The Shrimp lomein was also average. One appetizer and two meals was $100 which is crazy for regular Chinese food and they have auto gratuity.",0
"Overhyped. Always a long line. Waited approximately 20 minutes which is not that bad considering previous visits I've waited over an hour. Service is meh. Very cramped inside. Of the few times I've been there I had to share a table with another party..which made the dinner awkward. It felt more like a fast food restaurant than a family-style restaurant. The moment we were seated, a waiter came by to ask what we wanted to eat while we were still settling down with no chance of even opening the menu. As we were still deciding what to eat, the waiter came a few times before that too. We felt rushed. I also noticed on the walls they have autographs and photos of some famous Chinese celebrities. We ordered: 

1. Shanghai stir-fried thick noodles w/ chicken - a bit too salty, noodles were nice and chewy
2. Preserved veggie w/ meat thick noodle soup - my all-time favorite I always order at Shanghai restaurants. They use the preserved (possibly canned?) veggies (snow cabbage) which is dark green. I know it's preserved and should be dark green but because I've tried this at other restaurants that served the fresh green snow cabbage, I prefer the latter more. Just a personal preference, the dish itself is fine.
3. Pork soup dumplings - the skin is a bit thicker than other places I've tried. Not as much soup as I expected - broth is kind of thick, but still tastes good.  

I've eaten here a few times and probably won't be coming back on my own will since I prefer another Shanghai restaurant in the Chinatown area (Shanghai Cafe Deluxe on Mott St.). But I would still probably come if friends decide on this place in the future.",0
"This place is known for soup dumplings, and they're okay, but not stellar. I prefer Shanghai Asian Cuisine on Elizabeth Street, a couple of blocks away. As I'm from the neighborhood, I am fairly familiar with the restaurants, but out-of-town friends have heard rave reviews and must stop by, regardless of the wait and sharing of a table. Well, we came on a Monday afternoon and didn't have to wait for a table, but we waited 35 minutes for the soup dumplings. We kept asking the waiter where they were, and he told us it was crowded - no, it was not. Finally, we told them to cancel the second order of dumplings. After having noodles and scallion pancakes we were already stuffed. I had the Shanghai noodle soup - it was savory, if not a bit salty.",0
"Queue was quite long on rainy days when we got there.
The waitlist system is super outdated, there is no enough room for people who wait to be called.
I was given ticket with number.
Restaurant was packed at the time I came as it was during lunch time.
Dumpling choice surprisingly only fews, mostly menus are a la carte with many options of different protein.
The pancake was tasty and Dumpling was delicious.
To note this restaurant only accepts CASH payment and the gratuity has already included in the bill.
The price, is slightly higher compared to restaurants in the area.",0
Our favorite Joes Shanghai was midtown and closed. Now they have new location on Bowery and the food is not as good. It was so oily all of it. Soup dumplings were still delicious as usual. The oil left in the bottom of the plate was bad!!!  From the Shanghai noodles to the beef and broccoli.,0
"Overrated spot in Chinatown, if you're an out of towner there are better choices. I was disappointed from my eating experience. Be prepared to be packed like sardines because of the crowds. I don't think many in the ""know"" go here. I normally wouldn't choose a place like tis but I went with a friend. Never going back. I've been in NYC all my life, and have eaten in many of the area restaurants since a child.",0
Didn't wait too long to be seated as expected but the food wasn't as great as i thought it would be. One of the dumplings we had was also frozen on the inside. I had high expectation from seeing so many good reviews. Def disappointed,0
"Skip. Take a flight to SF and have way better dumplings ANYWHERE!

Giving one star bc required.

Yuck.",0
Overpriced and not that good. You pay for the name these days not the food quality of a time past,0
"Food was mediocre at best and the sitting arrangement was terrible. The soup dumplings there was nothing special, if not below average, imo.",0
"My friends and I think Joe's Shanghai is OVERRATED for their xiao long bao. The food contained MSG. We left the restaurant very thirsty. We ordered:

*xiao long bao - when xiao long bao arrived at our table it was turning cold. the wrap/skin were thick and soup tasted salty. A couple of the dumplings were broken.I like xiao long bao from Nan Shian Dumpling House MUCH better.
*scallion pancakes - it was nice and hot and tasty. Hmmm, I wonder if they used MSG with their pancakes.
*shredded turnip shortcake - This was different and something we never tried. It was not bad. Didn't know what to expect.  

2 stars for cold xiao long bao, thick wrap/skin, and use of MSG.",0
"Listen, there is a ton of hype around Joe's Shanghai especially around their soup dumplings. Let me be honest here, they were not that good. Their inner flavor lacked, there wasn't too much soup and it doesn't come close to the best soup dumpling in NYC. The other food was great - cold sesame noodles but if you're going for soup dumplings go here instead:

-Red Farm
-The Bao 
-Shanghai Heping",0
"This place is a tourist trap. The Shanghai food from another block over with the same dishes cost half the price and tastes a lot better. Can't believe we spent over $100 only for four items. We order the pork soup dumplings of course. This was the only decent item on the menu. Then we ordered a cold dish (tofu appetizer), this was really small and can't believe it was $15, totally not worth it for the lack of tofu. Then we ordered a noodle soup with five spiced beef, the beef was r really fresh and tasty but the noodles and the soup was so bland and lack flavor. The amount of noodle was so little it wasn't even enough for a small child to be full. Finally we order the sesame chicken, this was so dry , heavy in sauce but very dry chicken on inside. This was $20 and probably Panda Express would've taste better than this. The only dish that was decent was the soup dumplings and the Rick cakes. But even rice cakes was very greasy like fast food. For the sesame chicken- They probably cooked it overnight and reheated the chicken in the morning. It was pretty disappointing experience because we waited over 30 mins because we saw so many people waiting outside thinking this would be good but boy was I wrong. Never again.",0
"Joe's used to be my ""go to"" xiaolongbao spot, period. The first time I ate there in early 2000's, in my mind better than my experiences at DTF or even spots I had gone to in Shanghai. Times have changed. Service at Joe's was never great but now I find it completely rude. Our waiter hovered over us to order and snatched our menus when we were done. We never got waters refilled. Plates, utensils and cups were not clean. Food was still decent. We ordered squid with pickled vegetables, house special flat noodles, rice cake w/ pork, string beans, xiaolongbao(3 pork, 2 pork/crab) and green onion pancake. Best item was the green onion pancake which came hot and very crispy. Exactly how they should be served. Worst was the flat noodles which were like udon noodles cooked in soy with some additional toss ins. The xiaolongbao were still good, just not great. The soup was a little watered down, skins on some felt a bit thick and despite this, many were stuck together causing immediate tearing of the skin when picking up. All in all, good meal, just not special enough to battle a trip into Chinatown.",0
"I was pretty disappointed with this place after all the hype, and the line at the door. Clearly Joe's reputation supersedes this place, seeing as it was packed with white folks and tourists on a Monday night. My 3 star rating is based mostly on the food, as I didn't really mind the typical rushed NYC wait service, the communal seating or the ambiance. What we ordered was the pork dumplings (which were juicy and excellent, though I have had better), the lion's head (which was a huge disappointment as I was expecting a soup perhaps with vermicelli or at least a few more bok choi and all we got was a plate of undercooked meatballs), and the bean curd home style (now this was the real disappointment as I feel I get better bchs at my local takeaway around the corner from me in the Jers. And what's with the saucy sauce!?). Anyway, probably not planning to come back here anytime soon. Still waiting for Chinatown to wow me with more than it's raw ingredients like cheap veg. Hope it happens soon...",0
"I live in Chinatown , and have been in this place for a couple of times, a very busy Shanghainese restaurant , but not the best, and also more expensive than other ones in the area. I prefer to go to the one on Bayard Street, their dishes are much better. 
I always tell my friends , go and compare it yourself , you will agree with me",0
Two stars is generous. I threw out most of my delivery order. The mei fun was so soggy that the noodles fell apart. Tasteless. I didn't like the filling in the soup dumplings. The beef with string beans had a sharp unpleasant garlic taste. Overpriced compared to other Chinese restaurants. I thought it might be better quality. No.,0
"Overrated. It's not that amazing as the newspaper or other media had promoted. 小籠包 Xiao Long bao or the small pork dumplings that looks like mini steam buns are average and not so amazing that I would rave over it. I saw a line up a few times and thought what a waste of time. If you never had Chinese food except for ho-lee-chow or Manchu wok or Panda Express then yes this will be amazing. 

Otherwise - this is just average.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is a very stressful place to eat. The process for sitting down seems more complicated than it really is, and that's probably because no one really explains it. Then, you get sat down, and it's kind of a place where you need to know what's happening and know what you want before you get there, or else they'll just pass you by. It's loud, and there's a lot of yelling happening because it's usually so crowded. 

That being said, the food is really quite good. The soup dumplings were great but wait for them to cool down before you give it a go! My favorite however was definitely the scallion pancake. One of the best I've ever had.",0
"The food was good but I felt the staff treated us like livestock, herding us around the restaurant to suit their needs. Definitely not where you would want to go for a relaxing dining experience. The hosted was very rude. Take out is the way to go here.",0
"Having actually had soup dumplings in Shanghai the last 3 years, I can most readily assure you these are not it. They look it, but the taste is far from it. It's a step down from Ding Tai Fung which is a Taiwanese attempt at soup dumplings, but far from the authentic article especially the  crab meat versions. I was happily willing to accept these before I took a 3 year assignment overseas to China, but having had the real thing for so long, it is hard to go back to a poor facsimile.",0
"TL;DR: Shanghainese girl is not pleased with their pork XLB's. Also their twice-cooked pork ""hui guo rou"" (also not Shanghainese???) and the rest of their menu is not legit at all.

SERVICE: Well-staffed, but since it's always busy/crowded, I get that it won't be perfect.

FOOD: If you're looking for non-authentic Chinese food because you have a Western palette or don't really care to find real Shanghainese food, this is the spot for you.

The place is called Joe's SHANGHAI, but when I looked at the menu, I could barely find anything other than the XLB's that made me miss the motherland. I was pretty disappointed, but decided to try the XLB's because I wanted to give them a chance.

Going in, I knew their XLB's weren't supposed to be authentic, but it didn't even taste good. It was packed with heavy flavor, but lacked depth. The meat wasn't soft and juicy, it was like a hard meatball. The skin was okay, but not thin enough. I dropped my dumpling (rookie move) and it didn't break.

There was a Shanghainese family sitting across from us, I think visiting from out of town. They ordered twice-cooked pork, string beans, and kung pao chicken (all not Shanghainese dishes btw, these are the classic dishes my parents and I order when we realize we got duped). Their faces when the food came out though, it looked something like this~  :|

Also the people there, let's just say I saw mainly chicken & broccoli, sesame chicken, and orange chicken come out of the kitchen. Real adventurous bunch.

Overall, L O L.",0
"The service was mediocre. They rushed us to choose quickly. The pancake was soggy and tasted terrible. The pork+ crab soup dumplings don't taste really good. I feel like I can find frozen Xiao long bao and make it taste the same as the ones they serve, this is probably full of msg.",0
"Serving very tasty Dim sum, however, the service was gross. I brought one of my old Japanese friend, which was, I think, mistake. It appears famous for some Japanese because it was shown in a few Japanese guide books. The restaurant does know this and pasted some ads written in Japanese. The hospitality, however, is not reached to the level which deserves for real Asian foodies.",0
"The xiao long bao (XLB) here is more like DA long bao, it's so huge. BIG basket dumplings, if you translate literally. They're wobbly, messy, doughy, and it's just a challenge just to get the entire thing onto your spoon without breaking the outer skin. Forget those mini sharp metal tongs that they provide, it's totally useless.

On more than one instance, I barely moved those clumsily-constructed suckers a millimeter and all of the precious broth spilled out and onto the bamboo plate. That's just not good. I even did the slow ""rollover"" method, taking my sweet time. That's the liquid gold that you're paying for. Otherwise, you just have a sad, empty, and pathetic dumpling staring right back at you. It's nothing special without its juice, it's mojo.

I guess it's a matter of personal preference, but I like the smaller, delicate, and more compact XLB's from Din Tai Fung, if you want to compare restaurants in the US. China, of course, is in a whole other league. Although the skin is thinner, it is so well-made and strong enough to hold all of the juices inside. I also love being able to pop an entire XLB into my mouth, instead of nibbling one bite at a time like at Joe's.

While the pork dumplings were good, the crab ones did taste a bit funky, with some fishy flavor aftertaste. The green scallion pancakes were of the thick and chewy variety, with a very nice crisp on the outside. We also tried the seafood pan fried noodles and the the yellow fish. As someone who grew up eating good Chinese food all his life, I found the dishes to be disappointing, especially at the prices they were charging. 

With all the people waiting outside for their turn in mangling big juicy dumplings with those wretched tongs, it's a definite tourist trap. I thought it would be different, with the location in such a small alley-way, hidden and tucked away from the main streets. Chinatown in NY is so vast, it just dwarfs SF Chinatown. But so goes the never-ending cliche--it's all about quality, not quantity.",0
"Everyone goes crazy for the dumplings here, but I'm not sure why. 

I had the Sesame Chicken and it was good, but not any better than other decent chinese places. The place was packed while other restaurants seemed close to being empty. 

I can't compare it to other New York chinese restaurants, since this is the only one I attended...but I'd try something else before I came here again.",0
"I have no idea why everyone goes here, the food was sub par, and the atmosphere was hectic and crowded. The dumplings were very unappealing as well. Would not recommend.",0
"The soup dumplings are very very good, and I like the ambiance and staff--it is a well run and efficient establishment.  My problem is with the rest of the menu.  It is all very expensive and the dishes are quite large.  I understand tourists are willing to pay and that this set up works for a big group sharing multiple dishes, but it is impossible to eat the dumplings and an entree with 1 or 2 people.  I wish they had a lunch menu with smaller portions.",0
My friends were ranting and raving about soup dumplings before i came to new york.. i wasn't exactly sure what that was. so i get here to the infamous joe's shanghai and ordered 2  soup dumplings and 1 pancake for my friend and i to share. when they came out to my surprise its the same thing as xlb! (xiao long bao) here i thought i was in for a treat. I still thing Ding Tai Fung in California is better. :),0
More like 3.5. The hot and sour soup was good. The shanghai noodles was also good. However the XLBs were ehhh. We ordered the pork and the crab. At first taste it was good but the thick skin over powers the meat and soup inside. When it sat on the table for a bit the skin got hard and certain parts became inedible. My heart still belongs to Din Tai Fung for XLBs.,0
"This place is just okay.  Not worth the wait and not worthy of the hype.  Who the heck wants to sit at a table with other people?  Is the food that good that you have to disturb the social dynamics of your personal party by sitting with another group?  Might be interesting if you sit with another tourist group from Russia, France or Poland, but who gives a crap about that.  But, what if the other party is too overwhelming or creepy or just some loner?  

Indeed, the soup dumplings are delicious, but I wonder...isn't there some other place that has the same stuff? 

Not many local ethic Chinese at this place from what I saw...mainly lonely planet and fodors aficionados looking to experience a 'true piece' of NYC Chinatown.",0
"Shanghai dumplings is what this place is all about. We had an order each per person. The first three was very good and then it went downhill. The dumplings were either broke when I picked it up (was very careful) or there was barely any juice inside. If all were made nicely, I would've given 4 stars.",0
"Couldn't decide between a 3 and a 4. This place is known for their soup dumplings, like well known. We stayed in the hotel next door and there was a line every single day at most times of the day. The crab and pork soup dumplings were exceptional. The taste of the broth in the dumpling was just really delicious so I get it. The wait, however, and the unorthodox way they seat people just realllllly annoyed me. We waited over an hour for them to seat two people but saw parties of 3-8 come after and get seated before us while also asking those parties if they minded sharing a table so idk what was going on. 

Everything else we got besides those soup dumplings was meh, run of the mill Chinese takeout.

I might crave those dumplings but def not the experience so idk if I'll be back.",0
"I've had some damn delicious Xiao long baos in my tiny life span and I was so excited to try these because everyone I know who has lived in NYC has raved about them. Except they really didn't live up to the expectation. My friend and I ordered 3 orders of Xiao long baos because that's all that I came for, haha! And while they were good, they were not amazing. The buns were definitely filled with soup and the meat tasted fresh but the flavor was only a little above average. 

We also ordered some veggies and rice. They served our buns intermittently through the meal and almost forgot our 3rd order of buns! It just felt like they wanted us to leave at that point. Regardless, I had a good meal, and would recommend this place to someone who is missing their soup dumplings while in Manhattan. Not a bad deal for a good meal!",0
"The shrimp fried rice and the fried dumplings were nothing to brag home about. Didn't have much flavor. The soup dumplings were great! The General t chicken was also very good. Restaurant had a ""B"" rating when I went...I made the mistake of looking up why. Don't make my mistake.",0
"Went there last night with my family. Don't really understand what the fuss is about the dumplings,  I found nothing good about them, couldn't taste the filling and really, to wait an hour and a half for these dumplings was not worth it.
Apart from the fact that the place is dirty and the rest of the food is just average.
We ordered fried rice and noodles and they were extremely greasy. 
Don't waste time and money in this place.",0
"I'm going to be the black sheep here and say that although Joe's Shanghai is good, I believe Shanghai Manor is better.

You start by taking a number and wait outside among other eager eaters. A hostess will come out to call your number based on party size not based on the number she gave you. Oh and she may quote you 30 minutes but surely, it may be greater than that wait time.

They offer communal seating in round tables and for me, it makes it somewhat unbearable to eat as others watch me devour soup dumpling after soup dumpling. 

Soup dumplings are a solid 7.5/10. The dough is too thick and most of my soup dumplings were deflated with not enough soup!! BLEH. 

Moving on, their seasonal sauteed vegetable dish is literally broccoli, onions, a few wild mushrooms and bean sprouts. Meh. The sauce was just whatever as well. 

I surely don't think it's worth the 30+ minute wait but be my guest. I'll stick with Shanghai Manor.",0
"This place is always occupied with Long line of wait and you can see many people waiting outside. Eating environment is not ideal because you are always sharing table with other strangers. You probably draw more attention to other people's food than your own. 

Their Xiao Long Bao is huge compared to other restaurants. The skin is ok thin so you feel the delicacy of Xiao Long Bao. But the folds of the skin are not as precise as ding tai Fung. 

The meat and soup inside the buns are flavourful and I think it's better than ding tai Fung. So overall Xiao Long Bao quality is good. 

The stir fried green bean dish was too oily. I wouldn't recommend to order.",0
"The service is SUPER BAD. When we asked if the restaurant had wifi, the waiter just shook his head instead of politely responding us. The waiters here also seemed to keeping their eyes down so we had difficulty calling them. Very unpleasant experience !",0
"Their soup dumplings are delicious and their food is good as well but the wait is just ridiculous! 

I honestly don't think that it is worth the wait. 

40 minutes for dumplings? No thank you!",0
"Food was good. Service was just okay. The only thing I hate about this place is that they don't give you a receipt even after you have paid unless you ask for it. And they would make you wait a long time for your paper receipt. Also, they automatically include a tip for themselves so make sure you ask for your receipt to verify this yourself so that you don't leave another tip behind which I almost did, but didn't after I double checked the receipt.",0
"For the hype, I think this place is ALRIGHT. There's always a ton of people lining up outside during the weekends. The Shanghai dumplings are good but not amazing. I've had better elsewhere in the neighborhood. The service isn't great. You tend to have to share tables with other people. They also rush you out when you're done. Tip is added automatically to the bill. It's cash only so be aware.",0
"Mediocre food, really wasn't that impressed and am confused why it's rated so high. Most importantly, THERE IS NO DIM SUM, as it's mislabeled on here. Soup dumplings were okay, not the best in the neighborhood and the two dishes we ordered we not very good. 

T",0
The dumplings were excellent as we expect it.  Very juicy with crab meet inside.  I would order them again in the future.  Overall i like the foods but service is a different story.  The waiter was loud and rude. The restaurant takes cash only.  We had two people but they put 18% tip on the bill automatically.  I would give  a 4 stars but zero for service so 2 stars sound about right.,0
Two stars starts off with a two hour wait and follows this up with some subpar food.  The soup dumplings pale in comparison to mediocre wonton soup and were followed by overly greasy Chinese food.  The soup dumplings actually tasted like stinky feet on this trip to this institution.  The one saving grace was a semi-decent prawn dish but it did not make up for the 10 or so dishes that were worse than most delivery places in the city.  I would highly recommend avoiding this place unless with tourists that insist on trying this place.,0
"Food sucked. It was gooey with fat and didn't taste very fresh. It was like a regular shitty chinese place, except you have to share a table with random people and there's a wait. Also, not cheap given it's bad quality. 

Their only good thing is the soup dumplings and they're not even that special: just salty hot water with a little bit of meat in them.

Bottom line: HIGHLY OVERRATED",0
"Went here for my friend's birthday last year. 

The dumplings were very tasty, but since I'm from Hong Kong, I can't say they were entirely memorable. However, if you're looking for authenticity, this place is it.

The soup dumplings are perhaps the only food I remember eating that made an impression. The soup had a nice salty and savoury taste while the doughy texture was slighty tough, and not easy to break. That could be good or bad, depending on your perspective, but I like my skin thinner. 

There is an unfortunate long wait. You might have to share tables (I hate that), and the restaurant itself is hard to find.",0
"YUCK

I have no idea how this place draws you all in by the thousands. Was it on the food network and I missed it? Simply stated this place is awful. 

Decor - what decor?
Noise level - concert
Tables - enjoy your large round banquet table with several others you don't know.
Cleanliness - ok I know this is chinatown but this place makes CASH hand over fist and the place is a junky pigsty. I was super happy I didn't get sick afterward.

Soup dumplings - eww - too thick dough and pork had very little flavor
Scallion pancakes - greeezy
Moo Shoo Pork - too slimy and gross with no flavor to even bother finishing.

People NY is full of restaurants. Why would you choose this one?",0
"The first time I tried this place, it was the bomb! I ate the deep fried sea bass, soup dumplings, and fried rice (forget which one). However the second time there was a disappointment. I had the sesame oil noodles, Kung Pao chicken, and crab and pork soup dumplings. Overall, the soup dumplings is the best item there of those that I've tried. I've tasted better dumplings though. I felt like these dumplings were fatty and had a heaviness to it. Other places I've been to they had a clean light taste to it. The waiters are not friendly either. I think it was better the first time because of the nostalgia feeling of being in Chinatown in NY...I'm not from NY. I probably wouldn't go back again. Plus...the streets of Chinatown smells like hot garbage during the Summer...",0
"Staff was rude. I ordered for takeout then decided to have a few small bites so I wanted to get a table. They were so adamant about me getting a table bc I already asked for takeout, they said. How is it different from me dining in and then asking for a box to takeout after? I just did the reverse and they weren't even busy but they just didn't want to serve me. Literally had to talk to 3 waiters, including the head staff before they gave us a table. Food was also not even that great, really disappointed with their xiao long bao. Will not come back",0
"I came here with family around 4:30 and it was still pretty pack. We ordered 2 xiao long baos (soup dumplings), Shanghai cho chow mein(I forgot what's it's called in English), Pan fried noodles, scallion pancakes and some kind of sliced beef with sweet and sour sauce. The xiao long baos were yummy and fillingexpect that the second order, ALL of the soup dumpling were popped before reaching our table. The noodle dishes were pretty salty, everyone else agreed with me. The sweet and sour beef was decent along with the scallion pancake. However, they gave us probably like 5 drops of the soy sauce that came with the scallion pancakes so it was pretty disappointing not being able to dip the scallion pancake with the sauce :( 

There are better places for Shanghai food around Chinatown, save your money and go there. Although Joes is cheaper, it's not worth it. You'll be disappointed.  

ALSO, check your utensils. My spoon was covered with dried up soy sauce or something. They did not even apologize.",0
"SOUP. DUMPLINGS. really really great...efficient service and a good late night meal, but as for the rest of the food, just decent. Not bad, just nothing to write home about.",0
"Place is smack dab in the middle of china town. If it weren't for my handy iPhone I'd be lost in busy lil china town. 
Tried this place because of the reviews. Got the pork dumplings for ONLY $4.50 (6 dump-lings) and cha cha myun (black bean, tofu noodles). Meal came out to approximately $12! 

So when you walk in, it is mofo crowded. They basically seat you where a seat is not occupied....meaning 10 person table=2 person party times 5. Hey strangers!!! Let's be friends. The restaurant was also very LOUD. Screaming my order is never fun.

The dump-lings were OK. I was expecting something amazing from the reviews and what my friends have said. I swear it's just for the experience and not the flavor. The broth in the dumplings was bland. How disappointing. I had to douse my dumpings in vinegar sauce and eat it with the even more so bland cabbage from the basket in which the dumplings were steamed. 

What was good was the cha cha myun. Needs more meat but the flavor was intense and only bad part about it was that I had to gulp down 3 glasses of water to eat the flavorful sauce. chayyyyyyy! It was good but I'd probably eat it once in a blue moon. Don't want high cholesterol or diabetes from the sweet black bean sauce.

Anyways, hit it once for the experience, and honestly, once was enough.",0
"Ok, yes, the soup dumplings are good.  But that's about it.

For an entree, my friend and I split General Tso's chicken and the Braised Duck.  The chicken was good, but it was around $15, which is very pricy for what you get and for being in Chinatown.  I really didn't think it was any better than the kind I get back home from Panda Express, which is a fraction of the cost.

The duck was good, but a little too fatty.  It also seemed to come out way too quickly to be cooked fresh.  And it did not agree with my stomach at all!  I was nauseous for the rest of the day.

Also, the service was pretty bad.  I really wasn't expecting much on that end, but I'm not complaining about the waitstaff.  I'm complaining about the hostesses.  There was a 40 minute wait but they were not calling people in order.  If you happened to be close to them when they asked if there were any parties of two you got the table, even if someone else had a lower number.  Inefficient way of doing business.

Skip this place.  There are plenty of places with great dumplings that also have great entrees.  And there are plenty of cheaper places in Chinatown with better food.",0
"I know, I know, you must be wondering what the heck I'm doing in China Town when I'm flying all the way across from CA. But, honestly, I think there's something about China town that you just gotta visit and eat there no matter where you are in the world. 

Well, I came here because I heard they got good Xiao Long Bao. The thing is, I don't eat pork, so I wouldn't know what good Xiao Long Bao is and what bad is. However, I figure I can eat other food here and see how it tastes!  We ordered Chinese water crest with garlic, crispy beef, noodle soup, and a melon soup. The melon soup was a complete disaster, so not gonna even waste my time talking it. The veggie was nothing special; nonetheless, it wasn't overly salted, which is a +. Noodle soup.... it's just noodle soup...  The best dish was the crispy beef. It tasted almost like sweet and sour pork/chicken, except with beef. 

Bottom line, nothing special about this place~ if you're in NY and craving for Asian food, I would go to a Malaysian restaurant b.c. there's no Malaysian food in the West Coast.",0
"Great food but way too much going on here.

We tried a few of their dumplings, steamed and soup. Also had the  scallion pancakes. These dishes were all delicious and worth the 30 minute wait. And that 30 mins is short compared to their usual wait. 

The problem is that you share tables with random people and are seated super close to them and the servers are working very fast to get you in and out. I love good and efficient service, but I'm not a fan of being rushed. 

Come for the food but be warned. I will probably be back.",0
"Take it easy Joes Shanghai, don't rush me.  

I went here cause i've been craving soup dumplings a lot lately.  it was between coming here or shanghai cafe but my friend suggested this was the better bet.  WRONG.  i ordered the crab/pork meat and another just pork meat.  now the food itself is pretty good.  8 pieces of tasty hot soup dumplings.  yummmmmm.  3.5 stars for the food itself and I'd happily round that up to 4 if the service was decent.  WRONG AGAIN.

they sat us in a table of 10 with strangers, whatever, fine i'll make new friends.  upon looking around, they were all pretty old and grotesque.  taking their fake teeth out to eat and talking loudly like all chinese old timers.  apparently their hearing has gone but their voice box is as good as ever.  maybe i'll just ignore them afterall.  

we get our food quickly enuff and the waiter (an ugly troll of a man) stands next to me waiting for me to finish.  as soon as we finish our meal, he quickly asks ""anything else?"".  back up off me buddy, let me digest you nasty old man.  so i order some more tsing tao and nurse it just to annoy him as he hovers over me breathing down my neck with smelly hot breath.  *shivers*.  the people on our table had 2 empty seats as they wait for their friends to show up.  the waiter asks if they're showing up and they said probably not.  they get a scolding ""YOU HAVE TO TELL ME THESE THINGS!!!"" he yells in his most intimidating voice which was kinda funny.  

we finally leave with all the dirty stares upsetting my friend.  big shout out to lindsay and her company.  joes shanghai, decent food (i actually like shanghai asian manor's soup dumplings a little more and they have much better service and is not as crowded with a better decor).  very bad rude wait staff.  i understand u have other customers waiting but you just don't rush customers out like that.  as michelle on full house would say (god i hate that show)...HOW WWWUUUDE.",0
"First time eating here and I've lived in NYC for decades. I've gone by many a time but I refuse to wait in line to get into a restaurant, especially a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown when there are dozens of alternatives within 2 minutes.  But late on a Sunday night I strolled right in to encounter the dry 'yeah so what' welcome of the staff.   I loved the energy in the room of lots of Asian families dining among the obvious tourists and obvious locals trying to assert themselves to no avail.  

I'd rate the place A-OK mainly since all the people at my large group table were so much fun to sit with for a guy dining solo:  strangers became friends very quickly.   To sit with so many strangers was a nice change of pace.  But I just realized (thanks to reading other Yelpers reviews) that these guys charged me service charge and I did not notice it and over generously tipped on top of that.  I'm an idiot and p.o'd about it.

One of the women at my table insisted I order the pork soup dumplings and kung pao chicken, so I did.  Both were good, but I wasn't bowled over by the soup dumplings, they were rather mild in taste and kept breaking before you could get them out of the steamer because they were sticking to the bottom, which was annoying.  The chicken dish was excellent, not greasy at all, clear flavors, and I never got bored eating it which happens with Chinese food a lot for me half way through the plate.

I wish the meal came with rice.  It's the first Chinese meal I've had in my life where rice was not offered. And even asking twice for rice, the four or five waiters were too busy kibitzing to bother remembering to bring some.  I'm not supposed to have a lot of carbs anyway, so no biggie.

Oh, and there was no fizzy water to be had either.  ""No fizzy water, tap water only.""  Ok.  But after saying that it would have been cool if they actually brought some.

I spent $30 on two dishes with service charge and my damn generous tip, so the value and bang for buck is not terribly great.

So the place was good but I'll probably keep trying other places in ChiTown before going back.  Unless I walk by and there's no line.",0
"I'm so tired of my out-of-towner friends asking me to take them to eat here. How many times do I have to tell you that I don't want to come here? It's not good!

First off, I hate the name of this restaurant. What Chinese person names their kid, Joe? No offense to Chinese people named Joe, but the name of the restaurant is basically setting up the target market of those who'd be appealed by this name and come to eat here.

If you've had soup dumplings in Los Angeles (as one fellow Yelper mentioned, Din Tai Fung in Arcadia is amazing, and I'm not sure why they haven't opened a NYC branch) or the soup dumplings with the straw in Shanghai, then this place sucks. It's definitely not a place where people are supposed to expect authentic Shanghainese soup dumplings. Aside from their mediocre soup dumplings, the food on their menu is also pretty sub-par, that is, if you eat Chinese food on a daily basis. But if you enjoy Panda Express, then you probably think this place is the most authentic Chinese food you've ever tasted. I equate Mid-Western Americans eating here to a Chinese man from China coming to NYC to eat street cart hot dogs and saying that it's the most amazing hot dog he's ever had.  

So, I just don't understand what the hype is all about, and why there's always such a long line?",0
"The soup dumplings are amazing here. They definitely remind me of Din Tai Fung (I've only had it in Southern California). It's hard to describe the experience of eating a good soup dumpling. In quick summary, you put some of the dark vinegar thing on your soup spoon, pick up a dumpling with chopsticks and place it on the spoon, nibble part of the soup dumpling, drink up the warm soup, eat the rest of the dumping, then repeat. One order of the dumplings can be enough for one person's meal. If sharing one order, then another dish should probably be ordered if you want to be satiated at this place. The wait staff knows this is what you want to order--it's even circled on the menu. I think number 9 is what you want.

If you're alone of in a party of 2-4, you will probably share a big circular table with other people. I want to give this place 4 stars, but they made it a little awkward that I was a single diner.",0
"Overly priced with small portions. This place had some quality years ago but was really disappointed with the food recently.  Cash only and an automatic 18% tip for rude service.  The menu also is pretty limited for a Chinese restaurant.   Avoid the tourist trap, tons of better places in the area",0
"I had high expectations for Joe's as it was top rated for Chinatown. I was extremely disappointed in the service. Our waiter took our order and never came back. After we noticed everyone around us who arrived after we did was already eating we asked about our food and it was delivered to us 10 mins later. The food was mediocre at best. After took the first bite we immediately regretted passing up other restaurants along the way. On top of that when we asked for our ticket we noticed the automatically charged 18% gratuity for a table of 2, who only saw their server one time. This place was a terrible experience. Will not come back and would not reccomend.",0
"It seems that the only reason why most people go to Joe's Shanghai is just for soup dumplings.  I recently went a couple Saturdays ago, and as expected, you could hear the whole restaurant slurping up soup dumplings in sync.  Personally, I don't care for Joe's soup dumplings...  I think the ones at Shanghai Gourmet, a few doors down, are substantially better.  Yet, it doesn't matter as Joe's reputation seems to be entirely based on soup dumplings.  

The one thing that irks me about Joe's is that it is a tourist trap!  The line/wait can be crazy at times, and In my opinion, it's usually way too crowded for what it's worth.  Service can be slow at times as the kitchen does get backed-up, and be prepared to sit at a table with strangers in a community setting...  So don't be afraid to say Hi to the person sitting next to you.  However, in spite of my criticism of this place, there is one dish here that I think is fantastic and makes me contradict myself, and that is the braised pork shoulder, complimented with a traditional brown sauce.  It's the kind of dish that draws a lot of attention and stares when they bring it to the table. I highly recommend it if you like pork!",0
"Folks, I have eaten here several times since 2011. Food quality has diminished significantly and prices have skyrocketed! Everthing is saturated in grease and has little flavor.  This place is outdated. Do try other places or only have the dumplings.

We ordered shrimp fried rice. It looked good but there was no tastes. It's like they used dried veggies and frozen shrimp and no seasoning or a dash of salt.

We ordered general zhu chicken and it tasted like candied chicken served with bearly cooked broccoli. 

We ordered eggplant with garlic sauce. It was drenched in oil and tasteless. 

The dumplings were fine. 

The service is so consistently bad.  They yell at you if you are unhappy or have a special request.  The servers were all male most couldnt speak english.  There meal also includes a 15% service fee so be sure not to tip unless you want to go above and beyond cause they certainly won't return the favor while you are ordering or eating.",0
"Unfortunately this place was a huge disappointment. Way too much hype. We ordered the scallion pancake, XLB, crab and pork XLB, and stir fried noodles. The best dish was the scallion pancake. If you've ever had Din tai fung, you will also be let down! The XLB wrapper is way too thick leaving an unpleasant gooey texture to the XLB. Service is extremely friendly and quick. There's a 15% gratuity and is cash only.",0
"Foreigners and Americans have clearly marked their territory in Chinatown. Joes Shanghai is decent but unfortunately not worth the wait or expense. The soup dumplings are delicious, but the equivalent of chicken soup - comfort food at its best. Also, for the clean freaks out there - be warned - clean walls are low on their priority list.",0
"All time classic dumpling shop in Chinatown. I would say if it wasn't for the lines (tourists) I would give it a higher rating....I find it inconvenient because while it is good, it is not din tai fung good...and as such the line jockeying is not warranted.",0
"This is a mixed bag review. I would never put this place in the 5 star category but it did have some really good food items.

The good - the food

Soup Dumplings - very good, not the best I ever had but very tasty.
String Beans - flash fried and delicious
Crispy Beef - tasty but not the best

The bad - Communal tables - my fellow yelpers, you left that small piece of info out of your reviews.....

The ugly - no surprise, the service. The staff couldn't be bothered with you. They gave you the impression that you were interrupting their time playing on their phones with your requests of water and food.

Don't know if this is worth the trek to Chinatown but I am glad I tried it.",0
"Not terribly impressed with the soupy dumplings here at Joe's. First of all, I didn't know the right technique to eat their stuff and so my first bite into their famous soupy dumplings meant an instantly scalded and burnt tongue for me. Second, it gets very crowded very quickly, and unlike some other equally popular places in Chinatown - where the servers are still relatively nice to their customers - the guys at Joe's seemed to know that they were popular and for some reason thought that gave them the right to treat everyone like dirt. If you're going to treat us like dirt Joe's, I'll take my cold hard cash somewhere else, no matter how popular your dumplings are.",0
"We were walking through China town on our way back to Times Square from Battery Park. There was this place that had best soup dumplings in New York written on the side and so we had to stop in and try these dumplings. We were seated at a corner table and handed menus. It was SO hot in the restaurant. To the point that we were actually sweating just sitting there.  The server came over and we ordered 2 beers and an order of soup dumplings. She asked what else and we said that is it. She immediately got upset and was pushing us to order more. We said we weren't really hungry and just stopped in to try these amazing dumplings. She was huffy and walked away. The dumplings came out and honestly they were pretty bad. No flavor. Super bland. The whole experience was just disappointing,",0
"After waiting for one hour for a table, we were ushered into this small tiny place that they call restaurant. We were seated on two different tables...ordered dumplings and various other dishes.

We had: flied lice, fish in tomatoe sauce, flied noodles, beef something, another beef something dish and the dumplings. 

Tried the dishes and was utterly disappointed! For a second there...I thought I skipped to dessert already! YES...that sweet!! Umm, the food not the waiters. (please, don't get me started on them...) So there I was, sitting in a crowded chinese restaurant in china town (which does reek of garbage and urine...the streets not the restaurant) 

Then the dumpling came out. 'big deal' I thought to myself, but being the person that I am...I tried one anyway. WOW, I was in heaven! Never have I tasted such a exquisite thing. It had the texture of a dumpling and yet the flavor of a soup! Yum yum in my tum tum!! 

Well, too bad that, that was only the outstanding thing at the restaurant! I did not like any of the other dishes that we ordered. 

Definitely a hit and run restaurant. The waiters expect you to know what you wanna order before you sit down...and pay as soon as the dishes are empty or your stomach is full!",0
"When the rest of the world has Din Tai Fung, New York has Joe's Shanghai.  Supposedly, this is the best place in Manhattan to get xiaolongbao (soup dumplings).  I'm so obsessed with xiaolongbao I can eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Naturally, I had to check this place out when I was in town.  

The xiaolongbao was decent indeed.  Certainly better than anything I can get in Chicago.  But it was far from great.  First off, while the wrap was thin (a good thing), it didn't have enough integrity to give the xiaolongbao a perky shape - our xiaolongbao laid lazily on the steamer.  Second, the soup and meat ratio was a bit off - not enough meat.  While I hate to eat a xiaolongbao with too little soup, this one had too much at the expense of having enough meat.  Last, the flavor of the filling (soup and meat) was not strong enough (a bit watered down) - I expect burst of umami when I eat great xiaolongbao.  But it just didn't taste like they use top-quality pork and pork-stock gelee for the filling.  While Joe's Shanghai's xiaolongbai is by no means bad, it can't hold a candle against the real deal at Din Tai Fung.  Perhaps I'm being a bit too harsh - after all, this is New York, not Taipei or Shanghai.  But it's hard for me to drop my expectations for something I love so much and know so well.  So please take my criticism in its proper context.  

We also ordered the turnip cake, which was pretty good.  Zhajiang Mian (noodle with pork meat sauce) wasn't bad, but the noodle was not  hand-pulled la-mian (and therefore not al dente) and the sauce was too mild for my liking.  The beef with scallion was fine, tasted like any other Canto restaurant who can marinate their beef in soda water.  

Decor felt like a diner, and seats were cramped.  Service was efficient, if not a bit too brisk.  

Overall, like its name suggests, this place does well in Shanghai / jiangsu dishes - xiaolongbao and turnip cakes were 4-star level.  But dishes from other regions were rather average.  If I come back, I will only order the regional cuisine in which they specialize.",0
Overrated.  Rush service in order to get as many people in as possible.  Cash only is a negative.  Entirely too bright.  Nothing special about menu.  There are better shanghai places.,0
This place is gross.  Filthy and uncomfortable.  The food is merely marginal at best but at least it is cheap.  A tourist trap and the soup dumplings leave a lot to be desired.,0
"I used to be a frequent flyer here, I would just stop in and have an order of the soup dumplings. Lately I've noticed the skin has become thicker and it's just not the same... I don't recommend that you get any other dish here, they're standard Chinese take out items.",0
"This is the worst joes Shanghai location I have ever been to. The service was terrible. The waiter came to out table and didn't even ask what I want to order I had to call him back. The food is at best mediocre and inaccurate to its description. I got the szichuan style fish, which has a Chinese dish title that means spicy fish fillets in soup, ""shui Zhu Yu pian"". That's the way the dish is supposed to be according to the Chinese name. If you type the Chinese name into Internet the fish fillet with soup should be the only images that come up. However, my dish came and it was NOT a soup. It is a dish with fish fillets coated with some kind of sauce on a bed of cabbage! If that's the dish they are bringing, they should not use the Chinese name that refers to one specific dish! The total came up as very expensive for what I ordered. Never going to come back again.",0
"As a tourist who has never been to Chinatown before I felt a little awkward being seated next to another couple at a four person table. 

The restaurant was busy, our waiter was a little slow, but our food came quickly.

The dumplings tasted authentic though to be honest Shanghai dumplings are not my favorite. 

Prices were reasonable but not cheap. Tip was included in the bill.",0
"long wait always.  food's good, but it's way too packed, and you seem to be rushed from start to finish.  if all stars aligned, you'd get a good meal.  otherwise, 3-star for everything.

bonus: thought i saw russell wong getting take-out from here one time.  *drools*  xD
:)",0
"Joe's Shanghai was nothing out of the ordinary Northern-style Chinese cuisine. To be frank, it was actually sub-par compared to the other restaurants of the same type of cuisine. The service was fast. If you have a small party then you'll most likely have to share the table with others. The food was greasy even compared to other Chinese restaurants. The dumplings aren't as hyped up to be. They don't make any dumplings without pork! You could definitely find the same exact food down the street for a lower price. Wasn't anything out of the ordinary. If you are really craving Northern-style Chinese food then you'll do much better at a Chinese-Islamic style restaurant. Where they have better quality meat, larger portions and cheaper prices. There are plenty of those sprinkled all over the 5 boroughs.",0
"This review is based solely on the experience and service I did not receive.  I picked this place based on the good Yelp reviews.  We walked in and were seated right away.  After waiting for about 10 minutes and having not received a menu, I attempted to get the attention two of the older male employees, a couple of different times, they both looked my way and totally disregarded my attempts to ask for assistance.  Two other parties, who arrived after me, were seated, received service and starter food and I had yet to receive a menu or acknowledgment.  

I left this, cash only, restaurant very disappointed with the service and not being able to try the food I'd read about on Yelp.",0
"Pretty good place, fast service! We came for dumplings/dim sum but they don't have a large menu of this type. They had a few on the menu but they were just ok.  It comes up in the search for dim sum but is a little misleading. The entree that we did order were very good, though!",0
"Horrible experience!! Shared Tables, Rude Service and Disgusting rest rooms!! Food was okay and definitely not mind blowing!! Will not return back!!",0
Not a fan of their crabmeat pork soup dumplings here. The soup didn't have any seafood taste to it and it was really oily. Definitely a touristy restaurant.,0
"Its all about experience. 

If your first Xiao Long bao (soup dumplings) happen to be while you are in NY you will probably hear about and choose Joe's Shanghai. And 2 things will happen. 

You will love it and your tongue will be burn as hell. But after a while you will realize that Xiao Long bao shouldn't be the reason for going there. 

For what I have experience at Joe's their soup dumplings are quite random  As when they get cold, and this can happen before to get into your table, it doesn't really taste good. The dough get too sticky and is thick and bland and the soup can't be qualify as soup anymore but a thick greasy sauce instead. If the temperature is still hot you will like it, but to me are not the best you can taste. The dough will always be too thick and the flavor, no other than dough, can overpass the tasty soup and filling inside. Which are not the best ones either. About the filling you can choose among crab with pork or just pork . But I wouldn't say it taste like crab or pork although you can notice the difference between them. And at this point I have definitely quit tasting the pork ones. Its suppose to be a meatball, you know, it should be a ball of meat rich in flavor and juicy .. mostly juicy. Well Joe's balls are not juicy at all (hey, for real laughing go to meatball shop reviews. Peter D. Read please http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-meatball-shop-new-york#hrid:gOpoFCHTm9MriahPhTl_nA).  But going back into Joe's balls.. not juicy, but sticky and the look is unappetizing and I wouldn't eat that unwrapped.  

Its all about experience; but even for someone as me that has not too much of it I have already taste much better Xiao Long Bao. 

Other that soup dumplings the food is good. Consistent at least. The fried rice is good, vegetables have been always tasty and fresh. Their crispy noodles and garlic beef are also things to try. I'd recommend their Sauteed Black Mushrooms with Bamboo Shoots. Its an interesting dish, flavorful and full of crunchy texture but you have to be into vegetables to totally enjoy it. One of the things I tried last time was their drunken chicken (wine chicken), a cold appetizer that besides is a temptation to try just because contains the word drunken, it actually taste quite good. Its served at room temperature The meat is firm but tender and its not seasoned at all but a mild flavor instead acquired after the marination in the alcoholic broth.

The service is good one you are seated because the ones that will gave you your number are not as nice. Before entering time just past very slow as the waiting time could be 1h, even by 530pm, a bizarre time for food intake. And probably more during the weekends and at regular hours. Tables will be shared with others, known or not,  and upon entrance the time just go so fast. Water, tea, ordering, receiving food, and eating. There is also an army of servers that looks your party very close checking if you need something else or just refilling water or just if you are ready to pay and release the space to the next customer. But any case,  they have been always friendly and funny. 

Its all about experience and Joe's is already a touristic destination that you have to try. The place where you will be asked to go because its suppose you have to. But there is more places at Chinatown where the food is as good as at Joe's . Or better. Probably. For sure. And where the waiting time could not even exist. Maybe they don't serve Xiao Long bao, but again Joe's shouldn't be the first destination to get that. 

Its funny that the best thing I experienced last time I went to Joe's was the spicy chicken pieces that we got next door at Quickly; a Taiwanese tea place known for their bubble tea and snack food... but wait.. you don't really need to go to Joe's for that.",0
"Joe's Shanghai was overrated.  We tried them out and felt crowded and the wait staff isn't that pleasant and all this might've been tolerable if the xiao long bao were good...but they were just okay.  We compared it to Shanghai cafe the next day and there was a big difference in flavor and Shanghai cafe's bao didn't break as easily as Joe's.  

We had ordered the crab and the original xiao long bao at Joe's and honestly there was no difference in taste, which is just wrong.  Half of them broke and the soup escaped!  The pan fried noodles were delicious, light and airy!  The portion looked humongous but we ended up finishing it because the noodles are so light!  YUM! 

I recommend trying Shanghai Cafe instead for your Xiao Long Bao fix.  It's more spacious and the food is better!",0
The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the majority of the customers are non-Asians (mostly white) which kinda made me suspicious. It sorta ruined the authenticity effect and expectations but I remained mainly optimistic. We got the famous noodle dumplings. About 8. They were good. Fun to try but didn't taste anything exceptional if you ask me. Reasonable price. Not really an authentic 'dim sum' restaurant with waiters going around with carts of food. Sesame chicken was mediocre. And please don't get the fried noodles! I'm so used to good Vietnamese fried noodles in Jersey City. The noodles here were a joke. Huge portion but absolutely terrible.,0
"We were happy to finally try this Chinatown classic!  Definitely get your expectations in check before coming - this is not a quiet, intimate restaurant by any means.  We waited about 30-45 minutes on a weekday afternoon around 2 PM (it was a long holiday weekend).  Communal seating (if your party isn't big enough alone), loud noise levels, and service that is a tad scattered and rushed.  Soup dumplings were good, although we definitely preferred the pork over the crab.  Scallion Pancake was also a nice starter.  It's quite the experience.",0
"The staff here can go fuck themselves.

We were a party of 6 (wife and inlaws -- we're all Asian and *locals*) but was told there was a short wait -- ok, fine, no problem, we can see they're pretty busy, it's cool.

Roughly about 10 minutes later--during which they told us we had to wait outside because we were ""in the way""--we watched as a party of 8 tourists finish and leave. Did the staff at Joe Shanghai seat us--a party of 6?

NOPE.

Instead, they were waiting for a smaller table of 4 to finish and tried to seat us there, off in the corner. Their reasoning was that they wanted to ""reserve"" the larger table for a bigger party (of tourists, of course). And that's just fucked up on so many levels. Yeah, sure, you're going to make money off tourists anyway but fuck you if you think  a tourist's dollar is worth more than anyone else's.

THAT SAID:

Frankly, I'm not even sure why this place gets the kind of rep it does, as the siu long bao is okay but certainly not magical like pretty much all the reviews here state it is. I'd even go so far as to say that Shanghai Cafe over on Mott has better siu long bao.

And if you REALLY want their food, then just walk down a few stores to Joe Ginger. It's the same freaking place! The food is the same minus the crazy crowds and shitty staff! It's amazing that the reviews for Joe Ginger is worse than Joe Shanghai--is your life really that superficial that folks are going to laugh at you for checking in at one as opposed to the other?",0
"The new place is not so great. Bad experience. Horrible. If it ain't broke don't fix it. I'm beyond upset. 

The line is not as fast or organized. Seating is slow but I was prepared  for that. 

Then we saw beer on the menu but when we went to order our usual Tsingtao they said they had no license for beer sales so I was stuck drinking Diet Coke which I don't care for. Water sucked with the dumplings. Not the same. What happened to the license? Maybe tell people! 

It took forever and a day to be seated but I didn't mind until we were basically told to hurry up and order almost immediately after being seated. So rude! 

Do not rush me. Ever. I took a subway from Times Square then walked seven blocks to get here. Wtf. 
Now let me mention this all was on Christmas Day. This was my Christmas meal! I'm am so upset to be treated this way. Unacceptable. 

I had to ask for water twice. Got weird looks from staff. Whatever. 

Had to ask for the customary ginger for the dumplings. It was exhausting. They brought the food out in stages. Bring it all out at once please. My complaints go on and on. 

The food is good but the new place sucks. Just sayin. Not sure I'll be returning.",0
"Underwhelming. The skin of the pork soup buns is thick, almost gluey. Soup is oily and unflavorful. Everything we tried was tasteless and bland, and the dim sum menu wasn't impressive. I wasn't sure what the queue was for, or why it was so busy, since the experience was so subpar. There isn't anything to write home about their Chinese food -- Joe's Shanghai is plastered with awards won in the early 2000s. Spent time reading one on the walls, and the recommendation was for General Tso's, the shining beacon for inauthentic Chinese cuisine. So really, there was no difference between this store and the neighborhood Chinese place. Still searching for a reason for its popularity.",0
The soup dumplings was not good. Each dumpling I tried picking  up fell apart and the soup drained out before I could try it. Stay away from this place.,0
I was drawn in here because of the high rating and reviews. Was disappointed from the services to the foods. I ordered the pork Shanghai dumplings the skins were dried compared to other places. I asked for several times for water refills and additional dipping sauce.,0
"I was Cold and Hungry.. The line was LONG.  So I decided to walk around and get a haircut..If you actually have time which most likely you will... you can explore around the block. 

The Bad:Do you feel rushed? Ofcourse you do! Forget about seating, if they can fit you in they will. The wait staff is there for one purpose and one purpose only to get you in and out ASAP. 

The Good: The Xiao Long Bao's are tasty, big, filling, but lack something. Maybe they made it like an assembly line fast and quick,  you can end up with a good batch or a bad batch. 
 
Bottom line I'll give them another try soon.",0
Food was excellent.  We had to share a table with another group as well which dinner a little awkward. My biggest complaint is the hostesses were rude and spoke very little English,0
"The food was mediocre. The crab dumplings were not as juicy as I was expecting, and the noodles didn't have good texture to them. The worst part would be the service... The waiter wasn't attentive at all and the woman who seemed to be in charge didn't care to talk to any customer either. The overall experience was disappointing.",0
"Here's my assessment:  I'd go again, if I could be seated without a wait.  Because frankly, we didn't find Joe's to be any better than other Chinatown restaurants.

Their claim-to-fame soup dumplings bring people in.  The challenge is to eat them without burning your gullet.  We tried a variety of things: salt n' pepper calamari (lackluster), Szechuan beef (spicy, in a bed of bean sprouts with a chili sauce that worked well with the calamari), pan fried noodles (boring), eggplant with pork in garlic sauce (our favorite dish, with a brown, slightly sweet sauce.)

Service is quick, décor typical Chinatown -- really, nothing you haven't experienced.  Since I read 'cash only' on Yelp, that's how I paid.  You might want to call before assuming they take credit cards.",0
"Great xiaolongbao. 

Could add some boiled/steamed options to the menu. Space could use some cleaning.",0
"Can people stop hyping things please?! I came here with my family while on vacation because it was soooo overhyped by my sister's boyfriend. We had to share tables with other tourist which I don't mind as I'm use to doing that in Chinatown dim sum places back in SF. We ordered their oh so famous shanghai dumplings, green beans, Shanghai noodles and some other dishes. Their dumpling's skin is way too thick and the soup base is way too oily. It looks like I smeared Vaseline across my lips - not sexy. I can honestly say it was one of the worst dumpling's I've had. My grandma steams better ones from prepackaged store bought XLBS. I'm not even comparing these to din tai fung dumplings just the local dumpling places in sf and it still didn't pass the bar. Don't waste your time here!",0
"My feelings about Joe's have cooled. Forgo the wait and the hype, give Shanghai Cafe (pretty close nearby) a try for their better soup dumplings.

Ps. Never go to the Joe's Shanghai in Midtown East. More expensive, worse tasting, even more of a tourist trap than this Chinatown location. But more details to follow in a future review...",0
"There's definitely been a huge hype created around the soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and Joe's Shanghai - and I don't see what the fuss is all about. It's not even close to being the best soup dumplings that I have ever eaten (that honor goes to Ding Tai Fung in Taiwan; even the lesser one in Arcadia, CA is head and shoulders better than Joe's).

Basically, you enter Joe's and you order one thing and one thing only, their soup dumplings (either pork or crab). You share a table with another tourist family and you better hope that their well mannered. I once had a boy from another family sitting at the table start taking dumplings out of our steamer; definitely a weird moment. Anyways, the skin of the dumpling is definitely a little heavier, stickier, and some what unappetizing. The soup inside the dumplings is oily and heavy - and sometimes the actual meat itself was undercooked. 

Joe's, in my perspective, does not live up to its hype. But hey, you're talking to a guy that steamed his own dumplings hand made by a cute Chinese grandma; so maybe my expectations are a little high.",0
"I would give this place a higher rating, but their noodles were not good. Only their baos were good, but not as good as the ones in Flushing, at this place called Nan Shian Dumpling House. If you can, go there instead!

The baos were okay at Joe's, but the soup seemed really thick. I like a thinner soup, and when I ate here a second, time, I was actually disappointed, because it was not as good as I remembered it. I went with my sister, and we ordered pork and crab baos, along with tendon noodle soup and a peking style minced pork noodle, just because it had the spicy sign next to it, and I love spicy! Boy, was I wrong in ordering that! When the dish came out, it looked nasty. It looked greasy and the noodles were drenched in this ketchup looking sauce, literally drenched. It was spicy, sweet, and salty, and that thick sauce was just all over the place. I didn't even finish it because it was that bad, and plus those two cartons of baos were enough. Nothing special about my sister's tendon noodle soup. None of us finished our noodles.There are better ones elsewhere, like Bo Ky, over at Bayard.  It would have been better for us to order only 1 noodle and shared it. 

I also went to the Joe's in Flushing. Pretty much the same. My friend and I ordered this pan fried noodle thing with pork. It was so greasy! I felt so greasy, and fat afterwards, and no matter how much I wipe my mouth, it still feels greasy, along with my whole face! I probably could use that leftover oil on the plate to cook me some veggies.

If you come here, just get the baos, and if you're still hungry, get something you've eaten before, or go elsewhere. Also, the last time I went, which was around last year, the tip was already included in with your bill.",0
"It's basic Chinese , why is the line so long. Must be over 200 other restaurants in Chinatown serving the exact same menu.

I had the flounder and cold sesame noodles. I would recommend don't order this but I don't eat pork. Most other dishes here have pork including the dumplings. Can't they make a vegan dumpling? No not here. 

And it's cash only. What really annoyed me is that joes has a grade B for cleanliness. 
I will try other places in Chinatown. This one is for tourists only.",0
"After getting off the bus from DC, my friend took me here for dinner.  I had no idea it was this popular, and although we waited a bit, it wasn't for too long.  However, since it was just the two of us, they seated us at a large table and we shared with a couple other people.  Could have been awkward, but we just talked to each other and ignored those around us.  We immediately ordered the crab and pork xiao-long bao while contemplating other food.  We eventually decided on a tofu with crab roe and a stir fried rice cake.

I'm not crazy about xlb, so while the crab and pork xlb were good, I didn't go gaga over them.  The tofu was really decent though as was the chao nian gao.  Several of us at the table ordered some form of chao nian gao.  We had plenty of food left over for her lunch the following day!",0
"Extremely overrated and overpriced. Service was very fast, almost too fast as if they wanted us out of there asap. The food was not that great. No better than your corner take out place. For the prices they charge, I would expect far better.",0
"Well Joe's congratulations on the new location! It's more accessible, bigger, brighter, and a huge upgrade looks wise than its original location. Although I'll surely miss the original spot because it had so much character! If you want to beat the crowds, try getting there around 11-11:30ish, which we did and our party of 8 waited less than 20 minutes.

New spot, same menu, same prices (surprising). Any trip to NYC meant a stop for XLBs at Joe's. At the new location, these are still really good! Definitely worth a try if you are a fan of XLBs.

What was disappointing was that the fried rice and the green beans don't have the same flavor. The fried rice used to be bright and moist. This visit  it was darker and dry.  Which is sad because I used to love their fried rice. The green beans also took a step back, leaving me wondering, where'd the flavor go?? 

Maybe the need time to break in the new kitchen, but until then, I can only remember the memories of what used to be remarkable",0
Food was mediocre at best. Service was authentically Asian which means pretty bad.  And mandatory 15% tip is absurd for this type of restaurant.  Where you can't even get your own table and is sharing with strangers to eat,0
"Their scallion pancakes are the best ! I really dislike that so many people have overrated this place. I don't have a thing for their soup dumplings. I think the soup inside is a bit too thick. But otherwise, this shanghai restaurant is pretty good. Wouldn't come here with friends because the wait for a table is forever haha.",0
"This place is hyped up with a bunch of lo fans, the soup dumplings taste like every other place in fact I had better ones. I went in for dinner on a Thursday night and it was packed with foreigners. I had one of the worst tables, it was near the dish and kitchen utensils, so the waiters keep brushing past me dropping my bag. If you do not like sharing tables, I suggest skipping this place, I had a waiter that kept brushing me because he needs that ""open area"" to take orders from people in the same table and its annoying. My soup spilled because he knocked my arms over. Not to mention the Lo fans took our tea by accident. The table was so cramped with food.

I ordered pork soup dumplings, chicken pan fried noodles, and salt and pepper pork chops. First off the soup dumplings taste like every other places. I like how the soup is flavorful and the skin was chewy. The noodles were okay, I was expecting the yellow version, the noodles in my opinion was very soggy and chewy which I like but it was too fried up. I wouldn't recommend the pork chop b/c it wasn't salt and pepper at all and most of them were fat.",0
"Standards gone way down since I last visited 4 years ago.
Dumplings which is their Top Seller looks pretty messed up and the skin of the dumpling too thick and twisted really ugly . 
Soup inside was oily and dark colored.

Soft shell crabs were good but different way of ginger and onions.

Vegetarian duck was very tasty .

I dislike them trying to stick someone to sit next to a column !  We have to stand up when they have to put people on the next table , so it is really inconvenient to have a dumpling hanging on your mouth and then we're told loudly to stand up so others go in to the corner .  Told them they just need to do without one seat but they want every seat taken as it is $$ lost but we have to be inconvenienced to make it work for them.
With this kind of 1/10 service , I think I will skip
This restaurant on my next visit to NY .",0
"Mehhh..... 

I have had really good XLB in Hong Kong and from Din Tai Fung in LA. I came here expecting XLB's similar to one's they serve at Din Tai Fung. If you are also expecting the same caliber let me lead you in the right direction and tell you to  look elsewhere because this place is not that. 

Get a ticket and wait until they call your number. The wait for two was closer to 45 minutes even though we were told 20 minutes at the door. If you don't like eating with strangers next to you then this place won't be for you either. There are only 4-5 large tables at this restaurant and everyone is jammed packed like sardines at each table. The service here takes Asian service to a whole new level; they are unbelievably bad. My girlfriend and I ordered 3 orders of XLB (two pork and 1 crab each coming with 8 soup dumplings). With communal dining it will be hard to fit your 3 orders of soup dumplings near you since the table is pretty cramped. Now the wait for the food was not bad, it took 10 ish minutes to come out. The soup dumplings were decently sized but extremely greasy. I wish I had taken a picture of my plate after I was finish eating. It got to the point where my lip was starting to get a shiny gloss from the grease. 

Now let's get back to the service. Service here is absolutely the worst. I was seated next to three white customers and the waiters pretty much ignored them. One of the ladies ordered a vegetable fried rice and another one ordered normal fried rice; when it came out both fried rices looked exactly similar there were no vegetables on it so she called over a water. The waiter just insisted it was vegetable fried rice which I find hard to believe. BTW the service charge (tip) is included in your bill already so make sure you don't overpay. Obviously they know their service is real crappy hence why they automatically charge you. Not only that the restaurant just feels grimy and disgusting. I would not recommend Joe's Shanghai to anyone. Let me be frank with you, soup dumplings are not supposed to be that greasy.",0
"This place was really overrated. I've had soup dumplings all over and this place was highly recommended, don't know why. Service was good but food was very ordinary. Not worth the trip to Chinatown.",0
"Having been convinced by yelp and a coworker to give it a try, i decided to finally try their Xiao Long Bao. I have tried  a TON of different places Xiao Long Bao in new york from Shanghai cafe to Shanghai Cuisine to Shanghai gabaghoul.

The Good: we did not have to wait long(like 2 mins) to get in. The waiters were responsive to us fast. The calamari in black bean sauce is quite good. Very spicy but good.

The bad: the Xiao Long Bao are only adequate. Not the best, not the worst. In addition the crab XLB tastes entirely too fishy. Also the service is not that great. I ordered a cup of water and he brings me a scalding hot glass of water. Umm wtf am i supposed to do with that?? Take a bath??Plus we got stuck next to some loud annoying idiots :|.

Summary: I felt like it was like going on a date with a REALLY popular person at school only to find out they have no personality. I kind of went expecting the XLB to give me some life altering experience and to redefine the Xiao Long Bao experience. Only to find out it wasn't even as good as some of the ones  I already had :|. Not gonna bother with this place again, the atmosphere is subpar with the xlb being average. There's better nearby :| and certainly not the second coming of Xiao Long Bao by any means necessary. If you're expecting angels to sing while you eat it, not gonna happen :|",0
"Big lines, big bluster; not so hot.

Drawn to Joe's by virtue of it's renowned XLB, was willing to stand in line for an hour despite ample seating at nearby just-as-good Chinese joints.  Bad call.

XLB came piping hot, but dumpling skins were thicker here, and overall larger than their Din Tai Fung (and even Boston's Gourmet Dumpling House) counterparts.  Pork dumpling was certainly better than the pork/crab - as it is everywhere.  While okay hot, dumplings were nearly inedible when they cooled.

Other food is forgettable.  Crispy fried whole bass came with a sweet and sour spicy sauce.  Who puts sweet sauce on fish?  Fortunately, fish smelled fresh, and was otherwise a reasonable adventure.

There are better places for tourist food.  Go there instead.",0
"Rude, curt staff.  Pell street is a shady dump.  Food is garbage, utter garb.  If you like shard, you'll like their dumplings.  Joe's on W 56th is much better.",0
"I heard so many good things about Joe's shanghai dumplings, but it didn't live up to the hype. I had the crab and pork dumplings. The crab was definitely better than the pork. Their sesame pancakes were good, but a little too oily. I think din tai fung dumplings in LA are better.",0
"Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are kind of my thing. I was born in Shanghai, have eaten them all over Shanghai and in Nanxiang (the ""original"" home of XLB), and definitely eaten my fair share all over the US (including manhattan and flushing). 
It's all about calibrating expectations--are these as good as the ones you get in Shanghai? Not by a long shot--compared to the ideal, they are too big, the skins are too thick and sticky, and the soup is on the greasy side. But--the flight to NYC (or train ride to Chinatown) is MUCH shorter than the one to Shanghai. 
The regular ones here are not bad by Manhattan standards (yes, there are better ones in Flushing, but again, unless you already live out there, it's kind of a trek), the service is quick and efficient, and it is kind of fun to look around at the various celebrity photos dotting the walls. 
The crab ones are probably best avoided--the ones we got tasted ""off"" and had bits of grit and shell in them.",0
"I laughed a bit to myself when I read some of the earlier reviews of Joe's with tales of food other than the dumplings... Who tries the food other than the dumplings at Joe's?!?! Well, I guess a bunch of people did, and that's what we have these reviews for! 

Joe's is actually a chain, and the Chinatown restaurant isn't the #1 store... I'm *told* the location in Flushing is the one where the reputation for soup dumplings came from. This one in Chinatown is obviously more accessible (and infested with tourists) and has great dumplings, and then there's the red-headed stepchild of Joe's, up in midtown... Maybe there are more, but I haven't been to them.

Go straight for the dumplings. They're fun and challenging and delicious all rolled into one, and it's enjoyable to go with a group of friends and pile up the steamer containers towards the ceiling as you gorge your senses and tummies with those little soupie dumplings!",0
"Their location recently moved to this new location at Bowery. We have always loved soup dumplings and we visit joe Shanghai every single time we visit New York. we always felt joe Shanghai is much better than Din Tai Fung with their amount of soup actually in the dumpling. It has been in few years so we were excited to go back to joe. Good thing we checked on google because we did not realize they had moved from their old Chinatown location. We arrived at 1:45pm on Saturday and had to wait for 30 minutes which we did not mind considering how good these are. We finally made it in and had to share a table which is always the case. The dumplings were good as usual but the service was very very slow. We ordered 3 baskets and it took over 30 mins. Plus, by the time we finished our last basket the last dish still had not arrive yet. We were very disappointed. I am not sure if it's the new kitchen and them working out the kinks but service was less than desirable.",0
"It's good if you don't have to wait long for a table.  We came when they first opened, and ended up having to share a table with 2 other parties.  Always find that awkward -- and not sure the food hype really justified the compromised experience of having to sit with a bunch of strangers.  Cash only (of course, it's Chinatown) so be prepared.",0
"The soup dumplings were good and seafood panfried noodles were average. But, it is so Americanized, and I think they scam people a little bit. For example, adding a service charge on the receipt.  Plus, they make such a big deal about how amazing their dumplings are, but I can most likely walk down the block and get dumplings just as tasty. The service here is on your back the whole time and you feel really rushed.",0
"PLEASE READ: Cash only, made for tourists, would not recommend. Pricey and not worth it.

This place is trash. I'm visiting NYC for the first time, coming from Los Angeles. I've had my fair share of authentic Chinese food in the San Gabriel Valley such as Dragon Noodle, Mama Lu's, and Din Tai Fung. I saw this place had 7k reviews with a 4 star rating. They were multiple reviews with 1 or 2 star rating saying it wasn't worth it, however with the amount of positive reviews I gave it a shot.

We ordered the crab soup dumplings, cold noodle with sesame sauce, pork fried dumplings, and shredded pork with pickled cabbage soup.

CRAB SOUP DUMPLINGS: Horrible, they were big and filled with lots of soup, however the soup was so FATTY AND OILY. I couldn't drink after I tried it. Ugh thinking about it makes me sick. The skin and meat tasted good at least.

COLD NOODLE W/ SESAME SAUCE: Tasted more like peanut butter. Generic taste. Was below average.

PORK FRIED DUMPLINGS: Filling was average at best and not enough. Could barely taste the meat and very bland. Would not recommend this. Soaking in the sauce made it taste better.

SHREDDED PORK W/ PICKLED CABBAGE SOUP: Meat was tender, broth did not look appetizing, it tasted good though so it was fine.

Coke: 12oz can, the best thing I had here.

Overall we paid $60 for all these items and I left disappointed. It wasn't even that good. Should have gone somewhere else.",0
So many of my NYC friends recommended this place so we were expecting delicious dumplings. We ordered 2 pork dumplings and 2 combo dumplings to share. We also ordered the scallion pancakes and pea leaves in garlic. The dumplings were good but NOT good enough if I had to wait to eat here. The pancake and pea leaves in garlic were good though. The food was really cheap though.,0
"Except for being an anchor in the heart of New York City's Chinatown, Joe's Shanghai was just your average Joe.

Oh, the XLB are ok ... just far from amazing. Seriously, I've been to Shanghai several times. The XLB dumplings are so much better there (or in Taiwan) ... and even better in So Cal ... or Flushing. This can NOT be the best Xiao Long Bao that New York has to offer. Please tell me there are better XLB out there. Please.

Ok, don't trust me? How about my wife? She was born and raised in Shanghai China. Her take is the same as moi: any Xiao Long Bao is better than none, but Joe's Shanghai XLB were just a-ok. There's nothing wrong with being an average Joe either. 

After about a 15 minute wait we were seated at a round table ... with another 2 couples and a single diner. Yep, 4 different parties sharing the same table. Luckily, they were nice and everyone was there with one thing on their mind: Xiao Long Bao. My wife and I shared a double order of Joe's famous steamed Pork and Crab XLB (Xiao Long Bao) and an order of fried egg rolls listed as Shanghai Spring Rolls on the menu. 

Three stars for the average Joe's Xiao Long Bao. Two stars for the Shanghai Spring Rolls. Two stars for the communal loud dining experience and two stars for rushed chaotic service. Unfortunately for Joe's Shanghai, Yelp ratings aren't cumulative cause that would make it a 9-star restaurant. Actually, I'm not even sure why it's getting 3 from me except I'm a sucker for any Xiao Long Bao ... even those from just your average Joe.",0
Everything is so salty and they don't even taste good.  There are so many other place that are way better everywhere else.,0
"Joe you're so close to being a 4 banger!  But the mandatory 15% gratuity, cash only, and you made me feel rushed when I was trying to enjoy the explosion of your extremely juicy dumplings in my mouth.

It's pretty amazing how much soup they put in their XLB.  I had XLB at other places and although some were tastier, maybe less expensive, and even let me take my time slurping their juice, Joe packs it in BIG.  It was also nice that Joe's green pancake was yummy and wasn't oily as most others I've had.

So here's three stars for you dumpling man.  See you next time when I'm in Chinatown picking up fake LV.",0
"I had the turnip cakes, scallion pancake, and the soup dumplings.  Everything was ok - meh - edible.  Nothing was fantastic or well executed.  It is cheap though.  I suspect the high ratings are from tourists who don't know what good Chinese food is supposed to be.  

The soup dumplings were the biggest disappointment-- they're over-sized and poorly made.  The truly good and authentic xiao long bao establishments make them just big enough to barely fit int your mouth in one bite.  These are huge and the top knot of the dumpling is messy and will come unraveled.  

Meh. Don't need to come back here again.",0
"I came here for lunch with hubby and his friend. Joe's Shanghai used to be packed during lunch but not so much anymore, likely because there are newer restaurants in Chinatown. We were seated right away on Sunday at 12:30pm. 

We ordered 2 orders of crab soup dumplings, a Peking style minced pork noodle and a pork pan fried noodle. Portions are big, hence we could barely finish. Dumplings used to be better, they were a bit dry today. Both noodles were a bit too salty for my taste, there was an overwhelming amount of sauce on top. Hubby's friend liked it though.

Service was the same, they have enough waiters standing around to take your order and clean your table the minute you are ready.

The bill was $40 including tips, well worth it!",0
"What a rush! They want you in and out. Got the check without even asking for it. 

The food was mediocre. The best was the little soup buns.  They didn't even have the pan fry buns. What kinda Shanghainese restaurants don't have Shang Jian baos??

Service was a rush as I mentioned. What pissed me off the most was when the waiter placed the piping hot xiao long baos in front of my daughter. Like wtf. There are plenty of space in the middle of the table. This place is overrated and I won't be back.",0
"Soup Dumpling's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I went here yesterday for a meetup with my girlfriend's friends and I have to say is wow. First off you do have to go looking for this place a little bit cause it is off the beaten path a little bit. It doesn't seem to be to hard to find however since the place was packed and when we left I overheard more people down the street saying they were going there.

I never even heard of soup dumplings before last night and now Im just mad I haven't. The people I was with ordered 2 servings and we went to town. The service was fast and Im pretty sure they probably have a guy just making soup dumplings all day back in the kitchen. Anyway I digress, We also ordered beef with string beans, Shrimp Lo-Mein and General Tso's Chicken. The food was all delicious and spicy just how I ordered it. The Sake was perfect nice and ""walm"" and I only have two complaints about this place which brought its rating down to a three. 

The first one is I don't know if its an asian thing or what not but I cannot stand eating at a table with complete strangers, which I have only experienced one other time at Pho restaurant. I can't stand this practice especially with the spin thing on the table your food spins around this rando's and the same with there food in your face when your friend is grabbing a dumpling.

Number 2: The wait staff holy crap take a chill pill guys. I swear It felt like as soon as you sat down they were trying to push you right back out the door.",0
"I Never wanted to try Joe's Shanghai based on a hunch it's american (white people) asian food. Well, the restaurant was just around where I was, so why not?

We ordered 2 dishes : fried dumplings and pork soup dumplings, solely because that's what they are ""famous"" for. Big disappointment. The dumpling skin is fine, not too thick, and the soup was just fine, but the meat was lacking of almost any real depth of flavour. Usually fried dumplings are hard to get wrong in any other restaurant because they are so basic, yet joe's Shanghai failed on both. Both dishes had almost no flavour. 

We had to ask for chili paste/hot sauce, and even their hot oil chili paste also had almost no taste LOL. Sorry, this one is all hype and there are better Shanghainese restaurants in NYC

Service just hit or miss. Its not bad but it's not great. It's asian restaurant in chinatown anyway. And they put 15% ""service charge"" automatically on the check. I just pitied them and add $1 extra tip on top of the service charge for $16 food ( before tax and tip ) so total I gave the mediocre service 25%. 

I live in NYC so I'm not a big fan when they put the tip automatically for party of 2. My assumption maybe is tourists' area and generally they don't tip. Oh well....

Not recommend this place. Unless u want to eat mediocre food. For Xiao long bao I suggest "" Nang Xiang Xiao long bao"" in flushing",0
"I had such high hopes here... but I had kind of a shitty experience. The waiter was your typical rude chinese guy (whatever, used to it) but he kept rushing our table even though it was not very busy. The soup dumplings were not made with love. Half of them stuck and popped as I gently removed them - hell, I was operating like it was heart surgery and they just couldn't make it.",0
After reading the reviews I stopped into Joe's for a late lunch. It was a fun experience trying someone now and we had seen that there were a lot of reviews we stopped in. We had the pork dumplings chicken Kung poa and flat noodles.  The dumplings were okay but the flat noodles were out of this world. We ordered ours with seafood. If and when I go back I'll definitely try something similar if not the same exact thing. We shared a table which was fine and atmosphere was definitelyactive. I would definitely recommend stopping in if you've got some time on your hands. Fun experience and good food.,0
"Not really good & delicious as people comment 
Eggplant too sweet
Crispy shredded beef very sweet
The soup dumplings only good with the meat. The wrapper super thick.
We were expected for the roasted bejinh duck but we super disappointed.",0
"I had pork soup dumplings to go and they were really terrible. I really wanted to love it at least 10% but I cannot to any extent reconcile the other reviews with my experience. The dumplings smelled so awful I wanted to gag, like rotten tomatoes,and I was 90% certain the cabbages in the dumplings had gone bad. I was really questioning whether they had prepared a batch that they had been planning on throwing away for me,it was that bad,since I had informed them that I was in a hurry and had to catch a bus.1 portion has 8 dumplings, I was only able to stomach about 3. Taste aside, the texture of the dumplings wasn't phenomenal, it was about the same thickness as average Chinese fast food dumplings. I've had really good. dumplings in Hong Kong so I'm using that as my yardstick. The only reason I gave them two stars is because the extra star is for customer service.",0
"This place is usually over crowded and I never got a chance to go there at normal hours. 

The only time I went was a week night about an hour before they close. 

The soup dumplings are highly overrated. If you have tried the authentic soup dumplings in Shanghai, you know exactly what I mean. Not impressed. Perhaps one of the reasons the dumplings were below par was because I went there late and they gave me crappy leftovers, well, I don't know. 

The cold-served appetizers are pretty decent. I also enjoyed their cheap Tsing Tao beer.",0
"Might as well be inedible. The service included an inefficient hostess, a throw the menu on the table waiter and a money hungry waiter who yelled "" time to collect the money"" and then not give us change. I wouldn't have mind the change if he haven't make such a remark so loudly. In addition the place was super loud so I had trouble  hear myself the whole time. 
For starters we got the shredded pork and pickled cabbage soup. There were not cabbage in the soup -_-  and too much gross tasting pork. Tasted like pork and some weird pickle boiled in msg water. 
Now for the star of the show, their most prized dish, soup dumplings... We got both varieties the pork soup dumplings and the crab meat soup dumpling. First of all, the wrapping of the soup dumplings were tough, sticky and way to thick but even so they manage to have almost all of them leaking. The pork soup dumplings were almost flavorless with the remainder of the filling. And the crab meat soup dumpling tasted and smelled like rotten seafood being masked with pork... It stunk so bad I gagged and thought I was going to throw up. So thank god for the oranges they provide at the end of the meal since I couldnt get rid of the taste regardless of how much tea I've gulped down afterwards.",0
"Not worth the wait. I've been going here for 15 years. The food is usually quite good. But I had a really bad experience Saturday night. It was about 20 degrees out. I was in a party of four. we waited well over an hour while the girl at the door kept taking in parties of 7 and 8 that arrived long after we did. I finally started harassing her and asking her why she was making us wait when they were seating large groups that had just shown up. I get that it's hard to find room for big groups but all they have there are big tables and they empty out constatnly. We finally insisted that they pair us with a group of 3 and seat us the next time they had room for 7, which was about 10 minutes later. To top it off, the food was mediocre and I notice they got a B from the health dept. Sigh. Really, really, really disappointed by the way we were treated. Especially awful due to the weather and the fact that we had friends from out of town. It was late - we arrived at 745 and were not seated until almost 9 pm and we were starved by the time we sat down. Any normal restaurant would have apologized and given us a free appetizer or something. But no, they acted like we were wrong to ask for a table after waiting patiently for 45 minutes and seeing people seated who'd just shown up again and again. If you MUST go here, and you are a group of 3 or 4, I advise you to connect with the next small group that arrives and put yourselves on the list twice - as individual parties of 3 and 4, and then as one larger group of 7 or 8. i guarantee the big group will get seated first.",0
"Terrible service. They made us wait for a long time, and we got in line just like any civilized citizens not to block the street... We heard them calling out our number, walked to the door and they already gave our table to someone else. I can't imagine what kind of food would give them such attitude.",0
"I've had many many xlb throughout my life, the best is still Din Tai Fong dumpling house from Taiwan.  Joe's weren't bad, but the skin on the dumplings were still too thick.  It was deliciously juicy nonetheless, and the crab dumplings were even tastier.  I recommend getting both the crab and the regular to compare!   We arrived before 7 on a Saturday, only waited 10 min.  It may look like alot of ppl but it moves very quickly.",0
I'm not really sure what the hype is. After getting XLB from Ding Tai Fung many many times this place can't even compare. I think I prefer Shanghai Cafe and other places instead.,0
"The 小笼包 here is definitely good. I used to come a lot, but now it's become a tourist spot and the wait is too long. They also put parties together at one large table, which is uncomfortable sometimes. While the food is good, the experience isn't that great, so it loses some stars. Also their other dishes aren't that great. There are other comparable soup dumpling places nearby that offer a better overall experience.",0
"I'd have to say my experience here was mediocre. I suppose I'm not used to a fast-paced environment like this. My party of six was seated at a table with a party of four. It was a little uncomfortable, but wasn't all so bad. As some other reviewers said, they tried to cram as much business in as they could. Even the service was very rushed.

I had originally had a mind-set for dim sum so I didn't really know what to order. Our waiter went ahead and suggested their golden item, the (what I know them as) soup buns. We ordered both the pork buns and pork and crab buns. I wasn't all too amazed as everyone seems to be. The pork buns itself didn't hold a lot of flavor, but the buns with the crab meat was all... seafood-y. I think I preferred the crab combo rather than pork by itself. We also tried to order some wonton soup (I don't quite remember) and they told us it would take about 45 minutes because it was frozen. Not very easing, but at least they were being honest. The scallion pancakes were just dough. I'm more familiar with the ones that are cooked into a bubble so I was kind of disappointed to see the plate in front of me presentation-wise.

Other than that, the buns came out fairly quick. Not bad for something you don't see at a normal Chinese take-out.",0
"Single visit, August 2022: We only tried the soup dumplings. They were decent, but fall short in authenticity. They were almost double the size of soup dumplings in the actual city of Shanghai, and had much thicker skins.

To be fair, most soup dumplings in the USA follow a similar recipe, but when the restaurant has ""Shanghai"" in the name and is situated in NYC Chinatown, we'd expect better.",0
"Not what's it's made out to be. It's somewhat traditional in its preparation but the portions are small and the food is not that great. There are many more tiny Chinese restaurants just down the block that offers equally if not better food at lower prices. Plus, you get to skip the ridiculous line that always builds up in front of the establishment. The decor is very old as are the menus and furniture. I wasn't very comfortable, especially because my menu was kind of soaking, but it's not so dirty id leave. It's to be expected of an old Chinese restaurant. From a Chinese native, I'd recommend you look elsewhere for authentic tasty food. However, if you're just looking for a quick bite and you're lucky enough to not be greeted by a 15 min wait, then go ahead. It's not entirely bad.",0
"Communal tables, cash-only, and screwy line system - this place is, HANDS DOWN, not my favorite place to be in. 

You come in, get a number, and wait outside with the masses. The annoying part was that they don't call the numbers in order, or at least that's what happened when I was there. The disorganization has nothing to do with your party size either. When you're finally called, you're seated with a bunch of strangers. I'm thankful to have been seated with two others on the half-table by the wall, but even then, they kept staring at us because they didn't know how to eat soup dumplings.

The food here is pretty good and cheap considering the flavor and amount you get. I wouldn't say it's 4k+ 4-star reviews good, but still ok. Of course as everybody mentioned, the thing to get are the xiao long bao, or soup dumplings - but there are only two choices: pork or toilet. I mean, crabmeat. Obviously the crab one is my lesser favorite because of its fishy fishy broth, but it's ok! The pork one is cheaper so win-win!",0
Foods decent but the wait just makes it not worth it. Lots of people rave about this chinese food so maybe it just set my expectations too high. Price wasn't friendly either but understandable. I've been living in NYC for few years now so I know there are many better options out there.,0
"Expectation for the Xiao long bao is that you'll pick it up gentle while it's form is still in tact, then putting it on a spoon. You then bite the top to let the soup cool off, and eat it. 

Reality is that the Xiao long baos were put over Napa cabbage. The Napa cabbage is suppose to become a barrier for the container and the dumpling so it won't stick. Parts of the dumpling stuck onto the container causing the dumpling to rip and the soup to spill out. Another is that these dumplings are suppose to fit on your spoon perfectly however these dumplings were so oversized! Even when I did have a perfect formed dumpling, when I bit the top, the soup would just fall off the spoon! That's not how you're suppose to eat the dumplings. The taste was great, but the whole point of xiao long baos was because of its soup, and for that reason I give this restaurant 3 stars. 

SERVICE: 
Service was on the other hand pretty great! The staff seems super attentive even when the restaurants packed with customers! All Asian employees but know and speak English well!",0
"Do yourself a favor and DO NOT wait over 30 minutes MAX in line. There are similar restaurants in the area that do not come with the wait. This place is VERY average when it comes to Asian cuisine. The Lao Ming is edible. What really places this place on the map is the pork soup dumplings. They're tasty. Careful though, the soup inside is hot. You don't wanna pop one of these in your mouth. The soup dumplings are really the only reason to come here, but even they are not worth waiting over 30 mins in line for.",0
"Soup dumplings/xiao long bao-5 stars
Any other dish-2 stars (barely)
Service-1 star

Their soup dumplings is excellent: chewy and elastic skin that holds all the delicious juice in while the filing is well balanced and seasoned.  And not to mention they are decently sized as well!

But that's pretty much where it ends; eat your soup dumplings and run!  We made the mistake or ordering Peking style minced meat noodles and st sautéed shredded beef and they were both horrible!  The noodles was gooey and had no bite, the sauce on top was bland and has no flavor and was basically one big starchy mess with no sight of any meat.  I actually took one bite, and sent it back and didn't even bother asking them to pack it up or for a refund, just wanted it out of my site.

As for service, I know that Chinatown is NOT known for it, but when your server who works at a place known for their soup dumplings tried to rush you but taking your last two delicious soup dumplings out of the steamer and onto your plate and BREAKS THE SKIN this releasing the purpose of the soup dumplings without any hesitation or apology, it is not acceptable.  Especially when 15% service charge is built in regardless of party size.

Bottom line, come for the xiao long bao/soup dumplings and nothing more.",0
"The soup dumplings here are 5 stars. I prefer the pork one over the one with crab. They're delicious and hot and the soup is very flavorful. The other dishes here are 4 stars. We got noodles, calamari, and fried rice. The noodles were really good, but the calamari was very bland. I didn't taste the rice so I have nothing to say about that, but my friends all said the food was pretty good, except for the calamari. The service here is negative stars. So everything kind of averages out to the 3 stars I have to give them. Do not come here expecting any amazing or decent service. Their service here, as my friend would describe it, is exceptional... exceptionally horrible. 

We came here for dinner and knew this place was famous for their soup dumplings. Unless you're a party of 10, you will be sharing a table with another party. We didn't want that at first because we're never used to it in Boston, but eventually we didn't mind. We ordered the food, and when the food came, the server literally tossed the food on the table. When it was time for the bill, I reached out my hand so the server could hand it to me, but instead he threw it over to me even though my hand was on the bill. 15% tips is already included and I could understand why they would do that because if they don't, they wouldn't be getting a tip at all. Their service here is just horrible that you have to keep reminding yourself you're here for the food not for the service. Overall, I would definitely recommend coming here to try their soup dumplings, but after you're done with the food, just leave. Staying any longer would just make you feel very uncomfortable because they're just so rude.",0
"$hady, terrible customer service and I got bed-ridden sick the next day.


They have no consideration for your time.  At firstw e were told it was a 45 minuate wait.  It ended up being a 3 hour wait even though they saw us with an 8-yr old child.  No matter how I beeged them if he could have simply a bowl of rice while we waited, they pretended they didnt hear.  Just the nastiest tbing you could do, but to these people asking for an ounce of humaity is asking too much.
Second, they are cash only and sneakily automatically place the tip on the bill, so tnhey end up getting a double tip if you dont take the time to read the bill.
The next day I was bed ridden with a fever cold-sweat and shivering with chiils, blood-red eyes.  I did not recover for another 72 hours regardless of how many medications I took.

"For the first time in my life I feel compelled to write a review about something I am completely upset about it.  I don't even want to give a 1 star rating because I don't believe it even deserves that!  I wanted to give a full explanations why I will never come here again! First I want to point out the 2 people who made this experience miserable - Jean and Clare (Jean is the one with glasses behind the counter and Clare is the tall one who seats people), I have to put that out there because they are the rudest hostesses I have ever encountered!  I made reservations in advance for 16 ppl (as we had family coming out of town and I thought taking them to Joe's Shanghai would be a nice treat, boy was I wrong).  Our reservations were for 7pm on a Friday night for 16 ppl.  I was told on the phone that all parties must be present to be seated and I asked you don't give a grace period and the person on the phone said 15 minutes late we give away table - which to me was fair.  Friday night 6:50pm I receive a call from the restaurant - and meanwhile I'm standing right outside waiting for the rest of my party to arrive, they were asking if I am still coming and I said I am right outside waiting for everyone to arrive and the person on the phone said ok.  6:59pm I receive another call from them asking when am I arriving and I said I'm right outside so I walk in and I speak to Clare and she asked if all our party was here and I said no, just 6 of us, then Jean screamed you gonna lose your table.  I informed her when I called the person said they wait 15 mins for all parties to arrive and she said who took your reservations?  Really, how the heck am I suppose to know that and Jean screams I give you 5 mins!  By this time it was 7:05 and some of my party arrived so there were 12 of us (missing 4 who were stuck in unbelievable traffic!).  My sister started to say to Jean, why cant you seat us, we can order for everyone right now (and it got to the point she had to convince Jean that we are ready and Jean or Clare started to count how many of us were there and says if there's 14 I will seat you!).   Luckily a guy (who I think may have been the manager) said ok we will seat you.  Mind you by this time I was ready to leave because before the time that the 6 ppl from party arrived I was already having a screaming match with Jean and Clare who kept insisting I'm going to lose my table. With a party of 16 we had 2 separate tables but the one that seated 6, they gave away and our party had to be split into 2 tables and 6 of us had to share a large table while 10 of us were at the table next to them. By 7:15pm all 16 of us were there!  If it wasn't for my family, I would've left and never came back. To make matters worse, 2 tables down from us there was a party of 7 with only 4 people there and 30 mins later the rest of their party of 3 arrived.  Now tell me why were they allowed to be seated when everyone from their party wasn't there and not us?  When I asked Clare she said they had reservations!!! WTH I had reservations too!! For 16!!!! They cater to tourists and being Asian (as I am), they treat you like crap!!  Well that's how Jean and Clare treated us! We spent close to $300 on our meal and it wasn't even an enjoyable one. The food was subpar and having 6 people in our party sit with strangers was just totally wrong!  If it wasn't for the rest of my party I would've left and been happy to spend my money elsewhere. I did speak to the manager (I think) and he apologized and said Fridays are usually busy and I said don't take reservations then if you can't accommodate your guests. To Jean and Clare, there is a special place for people like you because of your attitude, you do not know how to treat your customers. I will never, ever, ever be going back there and I'll be sure as heck to NEVER recommend Joe's Shanghai!",0
"3.5 stars. 

Food: Pretty decent. Had the crab xiaolongbao to start, which were definitely good, but not excellent. The meat tasted fresh and there was a good soup to skin ratio, but the skin was a little bit too thick. The other two dishes we tried (kao fu-traditional Shanghainese bean curd dish and a pork noodle soup) were also pretty tasty but fairly standard fare. 

Environment: I recognize that there is limited space in Chinatown, but this type of overcrowding was just a bit too much for me. My friend and I shared a round table with another party and there was limited space between all of the tables. If you're not afraid to squeeze and are looking for cheap Shanghainese food, then this is not a bad choice! But personally the environment detracted too much from the food.",0
"Joes Shanghai six years ago was much different and better than my most recent visit. Unfortunately, the crab soup dumplings and regular soup dumplings lacked the same light dumpling wrapper and filling we remembered. The soup inside also had more fat renderings than I'd like. The restaurant was renovated but unfortunately the meal lacked luster this time around. Service was fine. Cash only to avoid credit card charges, plus an automatic 18% gratuity is included.",0
Horrible customer service. They rushed us to order and eat so they can seat the tourist. This place caters to tourist because they think they can make more money off them. Food was subpar but there are other great soup dumpling restaurants out there. Please is ridiculously small and packed. I would never come back here and would never recommend this place to anyone.,0
"Really really really bad service. And this is why Chinese restaurants get a bad wrap. You shouldn't yell at your customers. This ""younger"" server literally YELLED at us for asking about the status of our dumplings. When I say YELL, I mean't YELL. The ""older"" server handled the situation much better in a much more civil manner. 

We ordered crab dumplings and it took them close to 30 minutes to give us our order. Of course we're not happy. I understand most people ordered the pork dumplings so crab dumplings take longer. But the guys next to us who ordered the same time as us also ordered crab dumplings. They got theirs right away. Therefore, something must have gone wrong. 

Anyway, the food is good. But service is unacceptable. You shouldn't YELL at your customers and think it's okay because you're some famous Chinese restaurant in NY.",0
"the dumplings are good. so are the pan fried noodles. for some reason though, they seem to have trouble making beef. always seems tough and leathery to me. stay away from the beef dishes and you should be fine...",0
"The only thing that's god is the dumpling. Everything is bad. Seafood casserole was made from frozen seafood bag and it was dry. Didnt like it all all. I also ordered Chilean Sea bass. It was so oily and totally destroyed the fish. Also they didnt descaled the dish so i ate a mouthful of scales ! 
BAD",0
"Not being familiar with the area, I found this place via Yelp. Walking to this place and based on the exterior I was a little hesitant to go inside. We decided to give it try. As we sat down we quickly realized how popular this place was with many locals and regulars. Pros: based on our experience, The food was great! Probably would've given them 4-5 stars based on the food however.. Cons: they do make you share tables with strangers even when there's half of the restaurant empty. They are cash only. And thank goodness for the yelp heads up, they do automatically add a 15% gratuity into the bill.",0
"Pros - GREAT food in an authentic China-town restaurant!!  Service was very fast and prompt! Five stars for these aspects!

Cons (and what prompted me to give 3 stars) - it was SO cold! I understand cool temps are better than warm temps. But, almost every diner had her/his coat on while eating (so it wasn't just us) and almost every table has some or all seats right below vents blowing cool air. So, that was a big drawback. It's not a deal-breaker, though....it was our 3rd time there and we'll return for more delicious food :)",0
"Xiao long bao is what this place is about.  Secret of beating the lines is to do lunch around 11:00 AM.  Still a light chance of a wait but its not long.

The waiter/host staff are as awful as it can get.  They do treat you like sh_t, like they are doing you a favor for letting you eat here.   I put up with it because I'm here visiting once a year from CA.  NYC is where I grew up.

Their cold apps are very good, the cold braised beef and jelly fish are some of the best I've tasted but I come here for their xiao long bao.  I get one tray of each, with and w/o crab.  This fills my appetite and I'm off to the next great meal in NYC.

5 stars for the food, 0 star for the staff.  I rounded UP because their food is really good.",0
"The soup dumplings are good. Plenty of soup and flavorful meat. That's great if that's all you want to eat. If you plan on ordering something else, DON'T.

I think it would be hard to screw up beef noodle soup, but they did. Two orders of it. The noodles were extremely soggy, so it was probably already sitting out or they overcooked the nasty noodles and served it anyway. Or maybe it's b/c we're not Chinese they figured we wouldn't notice? Ugh.

If you want good dumplings and good food, go to Shanghai Cafe!",0
"The soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai have a pretty thick skin. They're also not made very well, so the little twist you usually get on top of the dumpling forms a big, chewy knot of dough. Maybe you like that. I don't. The filling inside isn't spectacular either- I think they overfill the skins, so that by the time you get your dumplings, most of them have already burst and all the soup has leaked out. Joe's is pretty overrated, IMO. I'll stick with Shanghai Cafe- it's cleaner, brighter and cheaper.",0
"Now it's really going downhill. Joe's in Chinatown is full on part of the tourist circle of life. It is on par with the out of towner ranks of the Carnegie Deli or even Serendipity in Midtown, where the waits are long and the food is overpriced. The kind of establishments where Zagat rates them as a ""must visit.""

Folks who have never experienced the wonder of a soup dumpling are sure to  marvel at Joe's. The explosion of pork and crab juices in one's mouth is already an amazing feat, but soup dumpling cherry popping experience is frequent here. And despite it's rather mediocre results over the last few years, most folks simply come here because they know no other alternative. Being famous helps, in addition to the fact most of the staff speaks fairly solid English here.

The prices are ""generally""  considered inexpensive overall, but are definitely pricier than some of their competing neighbors. It's nothing absurd like the Midtown Joe's Shanghai (http://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york) and the food isn't nearly as tasty as its Flushing location (http://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-flushing).

One would think that with more foreign customers the restaurant would somehow attempt to differentiate itself by offering better service. Nope. It's still just as shoddy and as rough around the edges as ever. How's being rushed out after waiting an hour plus for subpar dumplings feel now?",0
"Other soup dumplings really can't compare to those found here. The broth of the soup dumplings is my favorite part---it's really intriguing and has an almost creamy mouth feel. The exterior pouch is a little too thick for me but I think it helps to retain the broth. The dumplings come out super hot in a steamer. Pierce the dumpling, sip out the broth, spoon some chili paste and soy sauce on top, and eat the rest of the dumpling. Eat them quickly or they will start sticking to the steamer and all the broth will ooze out. Though they offer pork and crab and pork dumplings-- I really can't taste the difference between them so I opt for the less expensive pork dumplings. The dumplings are cheap and an order of 8 pork dumplings is just $5. 

Their other dishes however were disappointing to me and there were so many other places in the area that offer better food. Everything I have tasted so far was really generic and bland. The dishes were also overpriced, ranging around $10-15 a plate. I recommend skipping out on their main dishes and going somewhere else for dim sum.

Service is never really stellar here [nor is it anywhere else in China Town]. So expect a sullen face and the feeling that they are trying to rush you out of there. 

I usually come here just for snack and I try to come during odd times so that I don't have to wait.  I don't think  the dumplings themselves warrant a long wait, but I think they are definitely a must try when visiting the area.

"We were told by one of our friends that this was a very touristy place that there were xiao long bao's better elsewhere... Regardless, we went anyways just to see if it lived up to the hype. The restaurant inside was very authentic, there were full tables of different parties eating together and busy workers running about. My visit here was a while ago so I can't remember every detail about my visit here. I only remember how I was mildly disappointed in the hype. 

We ordered 1 crab and 1 pork xiao long bao. None of them amazed me. It was just okay? The skin of the little baos constantly broke. A few of them in our baskets were already broken when we got them. I'm not going to blame it on our chopstick use since even using the utmost care, we broke them. I preferred the pork ones much better than the crab, while my sister preferred the crab. It might be down to just your own personal taste. 

It was an alright meal to be had, but it didn't get rid of my hankering for really yummy xiao long baos... Perhaps I'll just have to go back to my boyfriend's place so his mom could finally put my cravings to an end.",0
"Love love love the soup dumplings there. And the price is good. 

Their service is fast once you get the table (normally has a long waiting, they do not take reservation). 

Need to sit with strangers on the round tables, if you wanna get private table, the wait will be even longer.",0
"This place is a tourist restaurant. This was probably the only restaurant that I had to share tables with strangers, besides dimsum. This place is just way too crowded. The tables and chairs are so close to one another, there is nowhere to move. Lost count of how many times either the staff or customers bumped me. Although the food does come outta quickly, it does make you feel rush.

We got xiaolongbao, scallion pankcake, hot and sour soup and crispy seafood noodle to share. The noodle portion was big since it was fried so that wasn't too bad. Xiaolongbao is good here.

Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant, does not make me want to come back.",0
"We came here around noon and boy, the place was packed.  But things ran pretty smoothly with the servers herding the customers like cattle.  Avoid bringing more than four people with you or they might have to seat you in separate groups.

Got two orders of the crab soup dumplings.  Pretty tasty but a bit salty.  Will have to try the pork next time!",0
"Shanghai cafe is my go-to for xiao long bao but every so often I would visit Joe's for their hearty version of the soup dumplings. I hadn't been there for a while so I decided to pay a visit today and I was kind of disappointed. I thought the taste was really bland. The first round of the dumplings were undercooked so they tried again with another round and the second time it was over cooked. Still, I got my fix but I think I'll leave these dumplings for the tourists from now on.",0
"We were craving good Chinese food, so we came here, based on ""word of mouth."" It was OK, but it needed to be better. Food was plentiful, yet bland. No particular difference between the dishes that were marked spicy and the ones that were not. I was looking for flavor, and I didn't get it.",0
Totally and completely overrated.  Skip it-service is totally rushed-dishes are marginal at best.  Not memorable....,0
"Came here around 12ish on a Saturday no wait, if you go later you'll probably have a wait as I've come after 2 pm twice and both times there was a wait of over 30 mins. FYI CASH only and they already charge you 15% service charge on your bill. 

Ordered the regular pork Soup Dumplings, Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup and Chicken Pan Fried noodles. Before we get to the cons, let me preface this by saying the food was good and tasty. I'd recommend getting then andwould rate the food as 4 stars.

That being said there were a few things that I observed that bothered me. 1. Women's bathroom had no paper towels or air dryer. I went back to my seat with wet hands and used the napkin on the table to dry off. When I asked the waiter for another napkin he gave me a paper towel - the ones you'd find in the bathroom. I found this to be weird, why not just have regular napkins? 2. There was leftover food residue on the corner of the table from a previous customer. Like must have been a sauce because when I tried to wipe it, it was jelly like and somewhat hard. I couldn't remove it. 3. Upon seeing them clear several tables, I can see how that residue was not only left but caked onto the table. The waiters didn't spray anything on the tables. They just used those ""napkins"" aka bathroom paper towels to wipe the tables. And it wasn't like they wiped the whole table. They just wiped certain spots maybe where there was visible food particles?",0
"You'll have to wait a while to sit down so you'll be starving. You take a look at the menu and think maybe you should get something in addition to the soup dumplings. Don't do it. Seriously. Stick to the dumplings and at least you'll enjoy your food. Everything else, you're better off at any of the thousand other restaurants nearby. 

The restaurant itself also leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps the best strategy is to get the dumplings to go, and get some other dishes nearby.",0
Not sure why this place is so highly rated.  It seems that Joe's has become more of a tourist destination than anything else.  It's no better than the average mall food court fare.,0
"After doing some extensive research, as an out of towner does, we settled on Joes for our soup dumplings. We were so underwhelmed. While the soup was pretty okay, the wrapper was too thick and gummy. The Shanghai noodles were the saving grace but they weren't enough to save this place from a 2 star review. 

TLDR? Go elsewhere if you have a soup dumpling craving.",0
"Pretty sure the soup dumplings made me vaguely ill. That or the scallion pancake, maybe too oily.",0
Yuck disgusting although the ducks blood soup was tasty,0
"Went here today for a birthday lunch with coworkers and it was great for our group of 9.  It is great for groups and sharing with a lazy suzy.  We started with a bunch of their famous soup dumplings - both pork and crab.  We all liked the pork best. I have had better soup dumplings, the dumpling part is quite thick, but they were pretty good.  

We also had the boiled wine chicken (I didn't care for this, acquired taste I suppose because others liked), meatballs (my favorite item - wonderfully flavorful over a bed of baby bok choy), spare ribs (these were OK), baby shrimp (very good), sautéed snow pea shoots (good).  

Overall solid and good, but not amazing, food.",0
"Overrated, Joe's Shanghai has become a complete tourist attraction. 

We ordered a basket of pork dumplings and a basket of crab dumplings. They tasted the exactly same and had to ask if they made a mistake. Nope. Apprently crab tastes like pork. 

Ate one dumpling and my mouth was so dry I had to drink half a glass of water. hmm...MSG maybe? 50% of the dumplings were soup-less and dry, so you'll never know what you're going to get. 

Their only redemption was their fried rice and noodle dishes, great flavor albeit greasy. But then again how difficult is that to make. 

Since we arrived at 4PM and only waited 20 minutes, I wasn't too upset. But I will not be returning.",0
"Service is annoying. The servers are rude and not at all efficient. I guess they don't really care because their dumplings are good. They were good, not great.",0
"New review: After having Din Tai Fung, Joe's dumplings just do not cut it anymore. Service has gotten progressively worse here. 

Old review: I go to Joe's every time I am in NYC. I have decided that nothing on the menu is worth eating except for the pork soup dumplings.",0
Very average soup dumplings. The broth is too oily and the skin is too thick. Their other dishes are also a little on the oily side. Go to Shanghai 456 or Shanghai Asian manor if you want great soup dumplings and incredible Chinese food.,0
"I've had xiao long bao from Shanghai (those unassuming hole-in-the-wall.. sometimes literally... places that you know will have you on the toilet crying sweet mercy before you even step in are where the best xiao long bao in the world are!) so maybe I'm a little biased.

I was pretty disappointed after all the hype... got the bao with pork and crab, and it lacked the 鮮味 (xian wei) all good XLB should have. The mouthgasm that I expected just never came; the dumplings were overly doughy and the meat inside was almost bland. We also got a bowl of seafood noodle soup, which was decent... nothing you wouldn't find outside of your local Chinese take-out joint. 

Dang, I really wanted to love this place too.",0
"Ok,I must admit once you have Din Tai Fung in LA it will forever change your perception of dumplings. I found this place on yelp and it was supposed to be the best dumplings in NYC. Service was good, I did not like that they were burning incents because I have a very sensitive noise and asthma, so I had to take points off for that. The dumplings were ok, I felt that their dough was too think and possibly frozen previously and did not seem as fresh. We also ordered the rice cake which was good. Overall it didn't hit the spot for me when I visited NYC. Din Tai Fung still owns the crown for best dumplings in my opinion.",0
If you eat mcdonalds definitely go here. If you want food that is made with love go to master bao. My last night in NYC was ruined because of the hype. I should know better,0
"Food: 4 stars.  Delicious, but really quite the norm in Chinatown.

Wait time: 1 star.  Place is packed continuously, but we had to wait 45 min for 2 people.  Service quite slow due to its busy-ness.

(Cramped.  Very, very cramped.  I sat next to a pole hugging my left rib.)

Expense: 1 star.  Very expensive based on other comparable places in the area.  The dumplings were fine- just not AMAZING, in my opinion.  The other dishes were fine, just pricey; and, they added a 15% auto-gratuity ""for our convenience"".  

Definitely a tourism place.",0
"Came for early dinner before going to the INTER_ exhibition. We got the scallion pancakes, a few of the pork soup dumplings and the beef. Overall I think it was just ok, nothing life changing to be honest.",0
"The dumplings were delicious. I came here as part of a food tour today. We had the crab and pork soup dumplings which I would highly suggest. However, a few things to note - Cash only and the service is not particularly warm or friendly. It was very crowded and reservations are possible, but the staff seems a little stressed about reservations.",0
"This is one of the worst restaurants in Chinatown, that is clearly resting on its laurels from years ago.  The Grade Pending sign in the window should have been enough of an ominous sign.  I joined some Chinese friends so ignored it.  Despite my ""authentic"" hosts, food was very unsatisfactory:  noodles full of grease (uncommon for true Shanghai cuisine), an old-looking mock duck, and overly battered shrimp.  Most disappointing were the soup dumplings (which used to be their calling card):  poorly constructed, way too big for the soup spoon, soup drips out before you even take a bite.  Staff is very inattentive in service.  Cash-only makes it a total rip-off.  The other disturbing sign:  the large number of non-Asian diners, clearly tourists who don't know any better what good Chinese food can taste like.  I had indigestion all night and a compelling need to share this review.",0
"You will wait an extremely long time for good food. I did, in fact, say ""good food."" It's not incredible, and it's far from disappointing. You tell the hostess how many people in your party, then she gives you a number and you wait until your number is called. In my case, we were told 45 minutes for the wait. 1 hour and 35 minutes later we were finally seated. The soup dumplings were good, but no better than others I've had. We got a stir fried noodle and seafood dish that was extremely good. I have no problem waiting a long time for food - it just didn't quite live up to the expectation.",0
"It breaks my heart to write this but I think Joe's Shanghai's best days are far behind it. My last visit there was awful. They packed way too many people at our table - we were sitting sideways! - and the food was awful. The green onion pancake was gummy, the dumplings were smaller, water was an impossible dream. I think it's popularity is forcing it to cut corners . . . I don't know. All I know is that I won't be returning to this place - the 40 minute wait (on the weekend) is no longer worth the food.",0
"I've definitely had better soup dumplings.  We had the crab and the pork dumplings.  I'm not sure why the soup in the dumpling was so brown.  It's not supposed to be THAT brown people!  

I gave them an extra star because the service was good.",0
"The Chinatown location does not accept credit card, you need to share a table with strangers even though there are plenty of empty tables available, unfriendly waiter and waitresses. I have to point out their mid-town location has much better services.",0
"I was so disappointed with my visit to Joes. Not only the restaurant accepts only cash but now they automatically add 18% tips to the bill. 
I came by for lunch and was able to get a table right away. The service was ok and the waiters were halfway attentive. 
I did order crab and port dumplings which were very disappointing. The top of the dumplings were hard like they were made early in the day and steamed to the point of drying. The broth inside the dumplings wasn't flavorful and cloudy. 
This is no longer a good place for dumplings. It's time for me to try another place next time I visit Chinatown",0
"The spicy braised eggplant with pork... amazing.  

Spicy beef noodles.. I wish the noodles had been chewier. (they were instead pretty hard... overcooked)

I think I let the soup dumplings get too cold... eat them when there hot.  The roof of your mouth will hate you but your belly will thank you for not waiting.",0
"You know what? After eating the dumplings in the Lan Zhou hand pulled noodles couple doors down and the XLB from real kungfu little steamed bun, I feel like the dumplings and XLB from Joe's Shanghai was not that good at all. I did see a lot of people waiting outside of Joe's Shanghai two nights ago. It sure is a popular restaurant and that's why the host was not as friendly as I would like. I remember the waiter we had was very nice. The food is not good enough though. I don't think I will come back again.",0
"I've been dreading coming here. It's been a year since I moved to New York, and what was once a twice a week ritual for me in Singapore came to a grinding halt. Why? New York is notorious for having sub par soup dumplings. I just needed this visit to finally confirm my suspicions.

First of all what I noticed was that the dumplings are much too large to fit a Chinese soup spoon. Why does this matter? It means that you're likely to make a much bigger mess if you use the bite-a-hole-in-the-dumpling method while eating, the juices are more likely to fall all over a plate instead of getting in your belly.

I prefer using the sit-in-vinegar-dumpling method to cool it down, then eating it whole. Allowing the juices to burst in my mouth. Immediately it was clear to me that the vinegar used in this restaurant sucks balls. The size of the dumplings also meant that cool down time was longer, taking away from the true enjoyment of perfect Xiao Long Baos.

The saving grace of these dumplings (which they called buns in the menu btw, another peeve), was that the skin was acceptable. It was thin yet pliable, mostly able to carry the weight of the fillings. At a 2/16 broken dumpling ratio it was acceptable.

I sucked it up and ate my food since I didn't want to be wasteful. Between the two of us we ordered 1 crab and pork, and 1 pork dumplings. There wasn't much difference other than the ghastly color of the crab and pork dumplings. Both tasted heavily of MSG and caused an unclean taste in the mouth and unnatural thirst.

Maybe it became difficult to discern in the depths of my despair.

Also this place is filthy the tea jug was gross.

We were so unlucky to be sitting next to a girl who was so annoyingly peppy about being a foodie, and that this would be her last meal on earth. Her friends seemed unimpressed as she kept trying to hype them up about the dumplings. It was fun to watch. Girl you don't know shit LOL

We paid and hustled out of there. Will not be back. 3 stars for good dumpling skin, which is really hard to master, but minus 1 for filthiness.

Sorry to pop your dumpling bubble! Supposedly it's the best that New York's got. That's sad.",0
This place was okay. It's extremely crowded and there's a line of people outside waiting to be seated on weekday. I took this as a sign that this place was very good but was honestly pretty disappointed. The famous soup dumplings were nothing special. The service was not great. It was an underwhelming experience overall.,0
"From eating at Din Tai Fung a.k.a. DTF in SoCal, I was really looking forward to eating some dumplings at Joe's Shanghai.

We ordered a couple orders of the pork and crab varieties.

The pork dumplings were just OK at best.  The crab dumplings were a bit better.

Compared to DTF, it just wasn't that good.  

Disappointing, but it was still good to try.",0
"Food and portion size is good but the service is the worst service I have had at a restaurant. They were unfriendly, threw our food on the table, and rushed us out as fast as they could. I definitely will be giving my business elsewhere.",0
Food was horrible .... Soup dumping were gross .. Lion Head was 4 meatballs for $14 .. just horrible not worth a dollar .. I know good food and it is not here !,0
The restaurant was 75% full but we were seated at a small shared table with 4 different guests even though there are about 3 open tables available. We hardly have any room to move around at the table. Waiters were not friendly. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and plenty for me to choose from... I won't be going back there.,0
"2 stars

As the comedian Ali Wong said, an Asian restaurant isn't authentic unless you leave the place ""deaf and emotionally abused.""

And authentic it is. I've been coming here since I was a toddler, and we don't like to come often even though the food is good, because the service is so bad and you feel so claustrophobic and rushed eating there. Joe's Ginger down the street is much more spacious and slower paced. 

For example, today the young lady taking names in the front at Joe's Shanghai was super rude and incompetent. She neglected to give my grandma a ticket when my grandma first put her name down, and it wasn't until 15 min later that we realized and asked for one. We then noticed that other parties who arrived after us and were of the same size got seated first, so we pointed that out to her, and she made up a bullshit excuse about how she didn't think we were all present, when in fact all four of us had been there from the beginning. When we told her that, she then changed her story, backtracked, and said that the other parties were a different size... which they weren't. When I pointed that out she rudely said to me, ""I know how to do this job. You want to do it? You do it."" My grandpa looked over, and she yelled at him, ""WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT???"" How shockingly rude. The wait was about 30 minutes today on a Friday for lunch, which isn't terrible, but it was the attitude that was unacceptable.

The only dish worth trying is the xiao long bao ($6.95 for 8) which are indeed very good. They're the best I've ever had in my life, better than all the places I tried in Shanghai and Taiwan. That being said, although O prefer Joe's over Din Tai Fung, one should note that they belong to two different culinary styles. The Chinese xiao long bao is big and a little more savory, while the Taiwanese xiao long bao at Din Tai Fung is smaller (bite sized) and slightly sweeter.

The dumplings are inconsistent though. Depending on the day, sometimes the wrapper is too thick skinned and broth too salty. But you can count on them always being very juicy and never breaking when picked up.

To be prepared to go deaf, get emotionally abused, be required to share a large table with 3-4 other parties, and be brought your bill before you're even finished eating. Note that a mandatory 15% pretax gratuity is automatically included in the bill and they are cash only.",0
"This rating is not for the food because I have not tasted their food. This rating is for service..
If you have a group of at least 4 or 5, then its good becoz if you are only two looking for a table, then you will be disappointed. I went there with a friend and they asked me to share a round table with 3 other strangers. I am not sure about others but for me, taste is not only the requirement, seriously how can you eat with strangers on a same table facing each other.",0
"this is one of the most overrated restaurants in chinatown, its on a historic street with old barber shops and other restaurants, the line is literally out the door no matter what time you get there, it is not worth the wait, the scallion pancake is way soggy, and the dumplings weren't that good, i've had much better elsewhere
boo for this place",0
"This restaurant was so atrocious that I started a yelp account just to comment on how terrible the food at this place was. I ordered the kungpao chicken, the ""bacon"" with vegetables, and of course the coveted xiao long baos. 

First the xiao long baos were way too greasy and the pork meat was way too tough, evidence that the pork meat was both cooked too long and not fresh. The soup is supposed to be light and refreshing while the meat is supposed to have bounce and be soft when you bite into them.

the vegetable with so called ""bacon"" is a traditional shanghainese dish which consists of pork belly and pickled vegetables in a black soy sauce brine. The pork belly and the vegetable were both so soft and so overcooked that it had no texture and were at that point just pork and vegetable MUSH.

The only dish that only semi decent was the kung pao chicken, but who comes to a shanghainese restuarant to eat szchuan cuisine.

If you want decent authentic food or just food in general DO NOT  COME HERE. As a shanghainese native this food was literal slap in the face",0
"Very disappointing. I have no idea why this place gets so much hype. Maybe it was good at some point. 

The food: The soup dumplings were ok. I've had much better on the west coast. Also got some pan fried noodles and they were awful. No taste at all. The gravy was heavy and the chicken was not cooked properly. The only decent thing we got was some fried quail. Two stars. 

The experience: Awful, even for Chinatown standards. The waiters throw stuff at you. They won't give you more than a couple napkins at a time. Place looks dirty too. 0 stars.",0
Not thoroughly impressed based on the hype of this place. Servings are huge and service was fairly quick. But the soup dumplings weren't as good as everyone hyped it up. Friends ordered the beef lo mein.... Also a miss. Not a place I'll revisit!,0
"Really good XiaoLungBaos and scallion pancakes, but food was a bit too salty for my taste.",0
"Decent food served up quick and priced right! Went here based on friends recommendation that they're known for great xiaolongbao and those didn't disappoint - good flavor and full of soup. The spicy eggplant and rice cake and fried rice cake with chicken were ok - little skimpy on the chicken and both a bit oily. Overall, good value for money but nothing that will have me craving to come back to next time i'm in NYC.",0
"It keeps getting more and more touristy over the years. They have a lot of waiters, though, and you get served very quickly. But you will feel rushed.",0
"As most everyone has mentioned, the soup dumplings are amazing! 

I was in a group of 4 and we were told that the wait would be 40 minutes to an hour, but in less than 30 minutes we were seated. We went after 8 pm on a Sunday. The place was crowded though when we arrived.

We ordered the soup dumplings, cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken, as well as a rice and noodle dish. I really must say that nothing stood out other than the soup dumplings.

Next time I go, I will just get two orders of the soup dumplings!",0
"I eat out three days in a weekend. Never been so mad until I visited this place. 

1. We were three, and were put in a table of six where two were already sitting, so we ate with strangers. 
2. We were not served water.
3. They had only two different wines, and five beers. 
4. One server got one of the dishes I ordered, and gave it to my friend. When she mentioned politely that plate is not for her, the server was rude and said something in his native language, and dropped the plate close to me. 
5. Foods were not served in proper order. 
6. Quality of the foods sucks! Never had so bad Chinese food anywhere in the globe. 

- - I wish Yelp had an option to put zero, or no star. They don't even deserve one star. AVOID THIS PLACE!!",0
"The line is always long, and there are very limited seats, so they put you with strangers at a table sometimes. Definitely something to keep in mind if that makes you uncomfortable. The soup dumplings are their signature items. I didn't care at all for the seafood soup dumplings, but the pork was alright. I've had better.",0
"Don't like this place at all for several reasons. The soup dumplings aren't that good because they have a strong pork smell (smells like old pork); also the dumplings sauce is all set and not covered on the table before the customers arrive(personally think that's kinda disgusting); let alone that, their tableware aren't clean. I can see the dry crab meat on the spoon ( it must from the last customer's and they didn't wash it throughly. How gross is that?)
On the other hand, the restaurant is busy all the time I suggest. They have three different customers sit on one table. I heard that is a style of this restaurant though. However, I hate that although the people on my table are nice to me but I find it strange, reason why is because they stare at the way we eat and the face my friend and I have( we make funny faces because of the place).

Well, if you have the budget, I rather to visit other restaurants where have similar menu items. I just personally hate the idea sharing table :) and dirty tableware.",0
"After a 10 hour flight from home to NYC, I wanted to try one of those most reviewed and highest rated restaurants in NYC.  Needless to say, this is one of the first times I've been disappointed by yelp reviews and this restaurant does not live up to its hype (I did my research beforehand and heard people in the airport talking about this place).
After asking the waiter what was popular, we order the two dishes (both of them soup & noodle) that he recommended and ordered those famous soup dumplings.  I don't remember what the two most popular dishes were called, one was a beef and the other was a salted fish.  Doesn't matter, both were overly salty and I didn't feel like it was worth it to finish them.  Then the soup dumplings came.  I was not impressed... they were slightly sour and yet lacked taste.  My boyfriend, who has eaten these dumplings in China before and was just as excited to try them in NYC, confirmed that they were not that great.  So all in all, a huge disappointment.  
The wait wasn't that bad, but I think we went at around 3 or 4 PM on a Monday.",0
"Ahh, so sad I am giving this place 2 stars but it has to be done...
The Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) were yum. I really enjoyed the Crab ones - fresh tasting crab meat. Pork ones were good too. Table shared the shrimp fried rice and seafood pan fried noodles. Shrimp fried rice was BLAND!! Even when they stir-fried it with soy sauce!! WHACK! The pan fried noodles were ok- I felt it was too soggy and not crisp enough. I enjoyed the veggies on top but not the noodles.

Overall, this is a less than mediocre place for Chinese food. The only thing that was good was the Xiao Long Bao but even with that, I have had better. It was good to try this place though but I wouldn't come back.",0
"I've heard so much about this place, that we decided to try it out while doing some grocery shopping in Chinatown.  Expect to wait for a table, although the wait isn't too long since the turnover is pretty high.  Just so you're not caught off-guard - you may end up sharing a large table with strangers.

We of course ordered the pork soup dumplings immediately after being seated - while they were pretty good, I think I may have been spoiled with the awesome Chinese food in Toronto and just have expectations that are too high.  I was extremely disappointed that a Shanghainese restaurant didn't have fried pork buns, so we ordered spring rolls and the scallion pancake.  The spring rolls were fried nicely, though I was not impressed with the filling.  The scallion pancake was one of the better items on our table.  We also ordered Shanghai fried noodles and fried rice cake with pork.  I was surprised that both looked almost identical since I'm used to the rice cakes still being white when served (these were covered in soy sauce).  Basically the 2 noodle dishes were the same and were on the salty side.

I guess if you're curious or new to Shanghai food, this certainly isn't a bad start - unfortunately for those of us who are accustomed to really great Shanghainese food, this was a bit of disappointment.",0
"Note: This establishment is CASH ONLY and shared table dinning. and MSG laced.

Ordered Crab Meat Soup Dumplings , Chinese onion pancake, General Tso Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Sauteed Choy sum with Garlic.

Could not eat the Soup dumplings due to presence of Pork the crab meat was misleading as it turns out that it was a mix of Pork and Crab Meat how ever my friend ate it and loved the flavour. General Tso Chicken was dry and non impressive, the Sauteed Choy Sum was well flavoured, over all the food was plentiful but nothing out of the ordinary.

Total cost of dinner for two was 63$ and a 20% tip which seemed mandatory to the already rude staff, an interesting thing to note is that the servers count the tip in front of the pardons and then react accordingly if they feel that it is not enough, be aware.

The remainder of the evening was spent feeling upset in the stomach.

Not worth a visit.

"i was at new york for vacation 3 weeks ago and didn't have time to write a review

long line and had to shared table.  Dumpling was alright.  tasted the same from any other shanghai restaurant that I had tried.",0
"3.5 stars for Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown!! The food is good but not great!! We enjoyed the the pork dumplings, chicken fried rice and beef lo mein... as mentioned, all of there were good but none of those dishes countered the wait and the just ok service.",0
Not sure it's worth the wait and the cash only thing is annoying. The soup dumplings are good but not out of this world. The seared sea bass was not good. And the beef szechuan was mehhh. And it blows to sit with randoms that order a crap load of food and leave you with space for your measly 2 plates! And it's like they ration the water.,0
Terrible customer service. My husband went to bathroom in their facility and they gave away our table while we were waiting.  Typical Chinatown customer service. Thumbs down!!!,0
"I ordered the crab meat xiao long baos here. Not a huge fan. First one I took in, had strips of ginger in the meat. Gosh! I was thinking to myself... if this is the case, looks like I won't be having many more of the 7 left in the bamboo basket. Fortunately, I didn't seem to taste any more strips of ginger in the following few. Soup's alright. Smell of the meat was rather overpowering. Hmmm. I think I prefer Shanghai Cafe's crab meat xiao long baos to this.

Oh... get this. So I asked for the bill and I was really surprised to see the 15% ""sevice"" (note typo) charge added to it already. Hmmm new to me - such audacity. That being the case, I didn't tip on top of that.",0
"No doubt the WORST meal experience I had ever. We came in and sat down, and a VERY RUDE waiter came over and spoke Chinese to me asking if we want some soup dumplings. Yes I looked/am Chinese but it does not mean I am extremely fluent or anything, nor does it mean I can understand their Shanghainese accent. While I took time to process what he said, he MOCKED me for being slow. And it occurred for a couple more times after that!! The soup dumplings were the only thing that we could truly swallow. The other things are salty but flavorless! The leaf portion of the Bok Choy (from the Vegetable with Bean Curd) are gone. The seafood noodle has a piece of plastic (probably from the packaging). And the rice wine sweet congee has a sour taste to it. I don't understand how this restaurant had so many awards in the past years! But Zagat 2017 and 2018 were nowhere to be found, and I can see why not! 

By the way, CASH ONLY! And the ATM right outside is broken. 

Summary:
TERRIBLE FOOD! HORRIBLE SERVICE!",0
"Super awful service. If I can, I'll give zero star. Also, even for lunch, they force you to give 15% service fee. Avoid it if u can!!!!!!!",0
"Long lines. Super noisy. Cash only. Tables too close to each other. Food was ok. $7 for a bud light. Bad beer selection. No good wine either. Had all the dumplings. They automatically added 18% tip and only 2 of us. Very sneaky and rude. Feel pressured to hurry and eat. Uber eats guy was screaming about long wait. Nobody seemed to care. 
They are a victim of their success. They are so greedy they put ATM machines so you must pay cash so they can save on credit card fees. And they added 18% without asking me. A bunch of greedy owners. Go to game room next door. Much better beer!!!",0
"What an awkward experience. 

Cash only. They automatically add a 15% tip / service charge... and I totally understand why after the experience here. 

We (party of 3) went on a Saturday, some time after 1:30PM. We went in and got our number, and since they call out numbers sporadically to make sure the party is still there, we waited outside in the heat where other people were smoking their cigs. Our number was called and they acknowledged we were still there. They called it again after a couple rounds of calling people in, and we were instructed to wait right by the door. We were finally let in the restaurant and we were seated at a table with 3 other parties. 

Chances seem very slim to get your own table here.. they utilize their tables to cram as many parties as they can. They also rush things a lot... which can be quite uncomfortable. We received our menus and someone asked if we were ready to order right away. Uh, give us some time to read through the menu? A couple of them stood over us, and then one of them opened our chopsticks. That was our first time that has happened to us... we prefer to rip open the paper and take out the chopsticks ourselves! As a joke, I broke mine in 2 so that they won't come back to do that since they opened ours. 

We decided to get a some appetizers and then head over somewhere else to enjoy more NY foods. We got 2 orders of the soup dumplings, a spring roll (comes in set of 1, for $1.95 each!!! PRICY for spring roll), and the scallion pancakes. I asked if anything has shrimp as one of us was allergic and the person was like it's pork, is that okay, and we said yes. 

Our spring roll and scallion pancake came. The spring roll looked like it had nothing inside because it was all white/clear, doughy in the center, but there was some light cabbage. Toward the end, there was a piece of shrimp. Thanks for the warning... The person that was allergic isn't deathly allergic, but what if he was? The scallion pancake was good, rather standard, not so crunchy or anything. 

Our soup dumplings finally arrived. The skin is thicker than most others I've had, and I agree with those say that they prefer ding tai fung's xlb over these in terms of taste. Despite the thick skin, the soup leaked for a lot of the dumplings. Either the top wasn't really sealed all the way, or the tiny sharp tongs cut through the skin. 

The food tasted good, and it's definitely a great deal for the soup dumplings. Our check was only around $20, and most places sell sets of dumplings for $10. 

If they didn't have the mandatory 15% service charge, they'd be receiving way fewer tips/extras because of the service. Cash only, feel super rushed, sharing tables, etc. Great in terms of business, but lowers the Yelp stars.",0
"After a long while of not coming here, we decided to try it out. The xiao long bao was as delicious as ever, and other dishes were good as well. The two missing stars are for the service and the waiters' attitudes.",0
"I thought the xiaolongbao was pretty good. Not Din Tai Fung level, but decent and tasty. The other dishes were somewhat subpar and seemed to cater to more Westernized tastebuds.",0
"Came here at a whim for vegetable glass noodle soup, pork soup dumplings & vegetable steam dumplings after the gym with my close friend. I wanted her to try this spot since she's never really ate soup dumplings before. I came around 3/4. it wasn't busy, we've got seated pretty quickly. This spot is cash only and they add the service charge on the check, unless you are feeling generous you could add extra but not everyone knows that the service charge aka tips are already included cause they don't tell you. The decor inside is really cool. I think this place is a little overrated, there are definitely other better soup dumplings out there, this place is alright it's not the worst. it's still consistent. They do have two atms inside the spot before you get into the second doors. In my opinion I am just not a huge fan of the thick layer of skin on the dumpling, I think it would've been way better if the layer was just a thinner, but it's not awful.",0
"A revered place, a landmark that any visitor wants to check off the list. But the quality has dipped like the demand for peloton! 
Soup dumplings are still a success, but everything else we ordered was a miss. Tasteless pork dumplings, veg dumplings are a joke, chewy scallion pancakes, underwhelming fried salt pepper fish. 
For all the demand this place disappointed.",0
"Small and packed! I thought it was sooo strange how they seat you at tables with random strangers. We had a party of three and they seated us with two other parties of 3.....Way to make your meal awkward! Anyhow, we got the pork soup dumplings...and it was good and alll but I was really expecting the BEST soup dumplings ever cuz that's what everyone said! They were just all right to me and also had a weird kind of aftertaste...I would recommend it just to TRY it but it won't be something I'll crave and HAVE to come back for. We had pan fried noodles as well but those were whatevers! But I wasn't expecting anything else to be that delish anyhow!",0
"It's not the same Joe's Shanghai when it first opened.  I used to come here when this was the first Shanghai restaurant to serve crab dumplings all over Chinatown.  

Fast forward 15 yrs later, I come back to feast my heart out on crab dumplings to be disappointed.  It certainly doesn't taste the same anymore, the restaurant seems to mass produce by quantity as opposed to quality.  

I guess this is what happens to restaurants that get the exposure they certainly don't need.  Now you would have to wait up to an hour to get a seat here and have waiters ask you first whether or not you'll be having dumplings.

The food here isn't bad, it just lost its roots along the way somewhere between the mid 90s til now.  I wish they could of undone the mass exposure and left it as a simple Shanghai restaurant that serves great soup dumplings. Oh well.  =)",0
"My friends and I always made it a point to go to Joe's Shanghai every time we come to NY. However, this time it felt and tasted a bit different. The xlb didn't come piping hot, and when biting into it the broth and meat felt lukewarm. It felt greasy eating the xlb and was not as enjoyable as I remembered it to be. The stir fried rice cakes and udon were ok, it tasted like they used the same sauce and toppings for both of the dishes. We all agreed that the quality of the food seems to have gone down a bit.",0
"Everything(including other food, service, and the environment) besides the Xiao Long Bao is horrible.",0
"This was a one time fun experience. It was a family style dining, they sit you in a big round table with others (must have not read that anywhere), but I thought it was fun and different. The food wasn't bad it was okay, we both had kung pao chicken. Noodles werent very good though.",0
"I went to Joe's Shanghai restaurant with a few friends. We were five people, but the only table available was one of the large round tables with a lazy-susan in the middle. They gave it to us and then they put next to us at the same banquet table another party of people! I couldn't believe that they wouldn't give us our own table. My friend complained in Chinese to them and they didn't want to give us another spot. 

We ordered the xiao long bao and a few other dishes. The xiao long bao were decent, but this place is definitely not a Din Tai Fung. I find the skins of the xiao long bao in New York to be much thicker and the soup to be fattier instead of a smooth and light broth. 

I found it very disturbing to have another group of people at our table, so I'm rating this place with 2 stars instead of 3.",0
"This place was pretty bad. I got their specialty item, the dumpling, and when I bit into it grease squirted out and shot all over my shirt. Everything we had was swimming in grease. And be advised that they take cash only. It was worse than the worse Chinese take out I've ever had.",0
"Everyone claims this is the place to go for soup dumplings, but I have to disagree. When compared to a place like Shanghai Cafe, it pales in comparison. It's not as juicy. The broth isn't as flavorful. The skin is a little tougher too... 

I also get pretty wary when a dirty semi run down place starts getting too popular... opening restuarants uptown? having ""Joe's Shanghai"" t-shirts/polos?

Something to ponder about...",0
"I don't get it. 

Perhaps the guy chasing the huge rat down the cross street ruined it for me, but hey, we still went in and gave it a try. Had the pork dumplings, kind of dry and super salty. The scallion pancakes were tasty but greasy, same for the turnip shortcake. The bill was $15 for two of us which is sort of hilarious for NYC (dessert in Little Italy costs more!!). Its definitely one of those places you have to try once, an experience for sure, but go back?  Not on your life.",0
"Excited to try this place especially because of the good reviews. This place was packed on late Monday afternoon. Waited about 10-15 minutes. Community style seating. You can be sat with strangers at a round table if you have a small party OR lucky enough to get private seating. People are friendly and keep to themselves. Saw others making friends and even sharing lol. The restaurant itself was pretty small, saw a large queue start to form after we finished eating. Over heard a party of 4-5 be quotes for a 40 minute wait. came for the xao long bao, left on the disappointed.  Being a fan of din tai fung I had very had high expectations. XLB wrappers were very thick and broke easily. On the better note, good taste and the actual XLB was on the larger size. On the cheaper side so wasn't too disappointed. Tried the pan fried noodles and scallion pancake and those made the visit worth it. 

PRO TIP: CASH ONLY, ATM outside. I get paranoid about random ATMS so I ran down the block to Bank of America and withdrew money from there.",0
"Review is only for the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes.

Overhyped soup dumplings but amazing scallion pancakes.
The soup dumplings, I don't get. Why do so many people rave about it, saying Joe's has the best soup dumplings? The filling lacks flavor and the skin is just, well, not good. The soup is decent though. That's where it makes up for where it lacks. The soup is flavorful and rich. Their only two options are crab & pork and pork soup dumplings. For the crab & pork, you don't really taste much of the crab, if any at all. The pork, it's just pork. They didn't put much into it. If only they put more effort into the filling. Many other fantastic soup dumpling restaurants have amazing combinations of seafood & pork, or pork & veggies, etc. This place does not.
The scallion pancakes were fantastic though. Perfect mix between crispy and chewy.
It wasn't too expensive being about $9 for one dish of dumplings. 

I give it 3 stars because the service was decent and the soup dumplings were able to temporarily satisfy my craving for soup dumplings. I do not really recommend this place for people wanting fantastic soup dumplings.",0
"The soup dumplings lack the refinement of Din Tai Fung, but they're not bad.",0
"When I first moved to NYC as a young-un, this was where my ex-boyfriend and I decided to have our first dinner after a long day of apartment hunting. 

I was kind of thrown back by the hustle and bustle of the place. The service wasn't what I was used to back home in MN or during college in MA. I felt like running out of the place when we were seated at the same round table among strangers who were minding their own dinners. (Don't come here if you don't want to sit across or next to a stranger or if you want a more intimate setting)

Dinner wasn't stellar. Again, I had high expectations coming from the midwest were I feel service is just better and helps defne the experience of eating out (otherwise you could just stay home, right?). The food itself wasn't great either. It was just bland. Even the famous dumplings did not sit well on my palate; it was runny, porky, and fatty. Bleh.",0
No. Just plain no. If you're going to come here for dumplings be prepared for them to only specialize in pork. Which would then lead you to sit down and order something else (Considering you already waited for about 40 minutes outside to get seated). Their regular food is a little below mediocre considering they have such high ratings on yelp. The service was disgusting. I understand that there are tons of people in need of service but slow down and wait to hear my order before assuming what I want. Thanks. Not pleased at all and will probably never come back.,0
"As I write this, Abby S's review is to my right and I couldn't agree more with her review.

I have been coming to Joe's for a few years now and the food has gone downhill. Last time I went to Joe's we ordered 3 orders of soup dumplings and about 20/24 broke immediately. This past weekend, they arrived to the table broken. There were only 3 that survived but many were broken upon arrival or broke when we picked them up. None of us are new to this- we know how to handle the delicate juicy gifts. But this was terrible. 

My second complaint is upon seeing someone else's order of snow shoots (snow pea shoots? or whatever those sauteed greens are), my friend ordered one. It was basically a large bunch of sauteed greens. Let me give you the price breakdown: Pork fried rice - $10, soup dumplings $7, snowpea shoots $16!!!!!!!! SIXTEEN DOLLARS for a bunch of greens with garlic! Are you kidding me?!

Sorry Joe's, but I can't do this anymore. Gonna try the other soup dumpling places to find a replacement.",0
"I honestly don't know what the hype is all about regarding this restaurant. The soup dumplings are just mediocre and the lines are hella long. The waiters are also super rude and they yell at the customers as well.. Not sure why a restaurant would be yelling at their customers. 

If I want soup dumplings, I would normally go to Shanghai Manor on Mott Street or anywhere else but to this place. LAST place I would ever come to is this Joe's Shanghai.",0
"I was very disappointed at this restaurant. Went there after looking at their reviews from yelp... well it seems like they paid for those reviews. The food was dry and cold. In addition the service was slow and they had major attitude. I love Chinese food and this place does not meet the quality standard. It was ok at its best. 

Also, be aware they will put other people in your table if there are 2 seats empty.",0
"Two words: Tourist Trap.

The only reason I was here was because it was late at night and all the other restaurants in the area were closing in 30 minutes. We ordered the soup dumplings, Shanghai noodles, chives and pork boiled dumplings, and a mochi dessert. 

I can't say anything was good. Even the tea tasted funny. They were edible food but so unauthentic. The chives and pork dumplings were especially ridiculous. They were small and just looked like dough haphazardly wrapping around a small lump of meat. They actually looked really bad in terms of presentation like a child crimped them up. 

The mochi sweet soup dessert was even more ridiculous! It barely had rice wine in it and it was super thick for some reason and had scrambled eggs in it. Not good at all.

To make matters worse, the place is also very dirty. The table cloth was filthy. I was trying to avoid leaning forward while I ate. Another lady came in to dine solo just as we were finishing up and the owner basically upsold her with the crab soup dumplings even though she said and pointed to the regular soup dumplings. The crab soup dumplings is never worth the money. Just don't do it! 

If you want soup dumplings and the mochi dessert, do yourself a HUGE favor and avoid this place. Instead go around the corner on Mott street to the other more authentic spot!",0
"I want to start of by saying, I didn't have the soup dumplings. But I did have the scallion pancake, which i'm  completely in love with now and a shrimp noodle soup, which was very good. The best part of my experience here is the price to quantity ratio. My soup which was huge and is usually shared (but I didn't) was $4.95 and my scallion pancake (which again I didn't share) was about $2. 50. So ultimately I was stuffed and my wallet was still also.",0
"The problem with this place is that it is zagat rated, being chinese i don't understand how zagat rates these places and give them high ratings. I have had better dumplings for cheaper than this place.

I never understood the hype for this place neither will I ever, ate here twice and never was really impressed with the dumplings.

If you are ordering dishes such as duck etc you might as well goto a normal chinese restaurant.",0
"Tried this place from the recommendation of a friend. He told me it was world famous for their soup dumplings and he was right! The crab and pork dumplings are amazing and very juicy. I would definitely go back to have those again. However, the other items on the menu we ordered were just so-so. The green onion pancake, spring rolls, and shredded beef with jalapeños were nothing special. The service was very attentative coming by often and asking if we needed anything. However, it was done with a very ""just hurry up and order"" attitude.",0
"Their famous soup dumplings is ok. The waiting is crazy long and you cant reserve in advance. I suggest going to other Shanghai Restaurants near mott street / elizabeth street if you dont want to wait. Btw, service sucks. they seat you with other strangers. A true cultural experience in a chinese restaurant :P",0
"I lived in Shanghai for 3 months during my year-long stay in China and I ordered Uber eats from Joe's today. I did not eat my food more than 30% of the way through due to the lack of cooking time and flavor. This is the third 2 star rating I've ever given in 3 years. Please note I am someone who does a low sodium to no sodium diet on a regular basis. 

Food 2/5
I ordered Rice Cake w/Pork and Xiao Lung Bao (Pork Soup Dumplings as Joe calls it). 
1) Xiao Lung Bao-- too much dough, not enough meat, and not enough flavor. The meat stuffing was not marinated ahead of time. Proportionally more dough, which is thicker than usual as well, really hurts when the meat is already not flavorful enough.
2) Rice Cake -- not fried long enough and lack of flavor. There's something Chinese people call ""wok air"", meaning you know how well the chef's can fry by simply tasting the dish. This dish had 0 wok air because it was undercooked. Can you imagine rice cakes not chewy? I tried throwing the rice cakes into my wok and cooking with them with a little bit of soy sauce and it was still a certified death--just NO. 
Price 2/5
My order $25 for 2 entrees before delivery fees and taxes. That's a lot of money for food that doesn't even meet the minimum standard. I moved from Silicon Valley so high prices are something I am used to, but this was a waste of money. 
I usually have 3 more categories in my reviews, but will omit them this time as I was not dining in.",0
"Honestly, pretty average Xiao Long Bao, I'm not sure why its so popular here. We ordered that and the crispy noodles with meat, veggies and gravy sauce over it, and both dishes were pretty mediocre.

The soup dumplings were hot, which was nice, and came with the typical sauce, but overall there was nothing too special about them. They tasted like the kind you could get at any soup dumpling place, there was no need to wait in a giant line just to try it here.",0
"This place fell off. The first time I came here 3 years ago, I ordered the the dry sauté beef with carrots and it was amazing, the dried beef was crispy salty and flavorful. Order it again today and it was very disappointing. Nothing was fried or dry about it. It was soggy and had no flavor and they added celery? When asked if this was the correct dish, the waiter hastily said yes and ran off without asking what our concern was.",0
"Such a huge disappointment, but what did I expect? This has become a total tourist trap. I haven't been here for more than 5 years now, but a friend suggested we grab soup dumplings from here. I was hesitant at first because of the wait, but he assured me that it was going to be 15 minutes. Surprisingly, he was right. We were seated in 15 minutes on a Friday night. Was that a sign already?

We ordered one crab and one pork soup dumpling, as well as, pan fried beef rice cake. The crab soup dumplings came first. I was already disappointed to see that one has popped and 5 of them were opened. Both the soup and meat were well seasoned, but I could barely taste any crab. None of the pork ones were opened or popped, but... I had 4 that barely had any soup or no soup at all. I made sure to check if they were popped before biting into them, but they weren't and nothing leaked through the basket. The dumpling was dry, flavorless and a disappointment. The beef rice cakes weren't great either; the beef had a starchy powder feel to it and it didn't have much flavor. Joe's quality has definitely fell since the last time I was here and now I'm reminded as to why I don't come here.",0
"My original intent for going here was to try their soup dumpling, which I found to be underwhelming. (Between Din Tai Fung and Joe's, I'm with the Din Tai Fung camp.) Anyways, we ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings, pork only dumplings, snow pea sprouts, and the spicy beef noodle soup. Surprisingly enough, the highlights of the meal were not the soup dumplings but the snow pea sprouts and spicy beef noodle soup. Both of these dishes were flavorful with quality ingredients... would come back for these but not the dumplings.",0
"Long wait as they r always busy.. N U'll probably have to share tables with other people.. The pork xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) r not impressive, about the same as nanxiang n other places. Their crab meat soup dumplings however, r the best I have ever tasted so I would definitely  recommend getting that... Their soup noddles r very plain...",0
I gotta admit my worse experience after going to it... it's not really the food rather than the waiter who was scratching himself all over furiously... really killed the mood... food is alright but price is just not made for average people to go often,0
I guess i am spoiled since i live in San Francisco and we have an amazing Chinatown. Food was mediocre. Service was so so. Wasnt a fan of the communal table with lazy susans. All in all not for me.,0
I ordered takeout and it seems the food quality is inconsistent.  The crab meat in the dumplings was not fresh.  The Peking style minced pork noodle was bland.  The fried rice cakes with pork was a soggy oily mess - like they didn't bother frying it.  They raised the prices (which is understandable) but the quality doesn't justify it.,0
"Always a wait when we go here, so be ready. XLB is delicious but only when dine in. Wanted to avoid the wait and bought the frozen crab XLB to steam at home. Followed their instruction of steaming for 12 minutes, super soggy and the soup spilled outside the XLB. High star for dine in, but overall star was lowered to average because of the disappointing frozen to go experience",0
Food was good but service not so much.  Be prepared to share seating with strangers at the same table.,0
"This place has the worst quality meat that can be used, for $15 a dish. We didn't order the dumplings as we don't eat pork. So if you plan on eating here and don't like dumplings turn around and go somewhere else. They add 15% service charge automatically for 2 people. Service is okay but when we told them one dish was bad they said that's how it tastes. They must have ate it when they took it back and I had to pay for it. Worst Chinese restaurant and definitely not worth the walk.",0
"If you're looking for authentic Chinese food, this is not the spot. The soup dumplings were amazing but everything else we ordered was pretty mid. 

We had the soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, Peking duck, and fried rice. The Peking duck could've been crispier and cut better. The portions also seemed small given the price. The scallion pancakes also could've been crispier and fried more evenly. I wish the dough on the soup dumplings was thinner but the soup and filling were delicious. 

The service could've been improved especially the way they handled the waitlist. We had to wait outside for 40 minutes to get a table.",0
"I used to go here back in the days, like in the 90s, and it was very good. I had gone back a few times a while ago and still good but last time I ate here wasn't impressed and not coming back for sure.",0
"I am visiting from New Zealand.I had seen Joes shanghai on a few food bloggers sites.So I had Joe Shanghai on my list of places to try.
We walked all the way from Grand Central to Pell street to try Joe's Shanghai.
However came out with a mediocre experience.
The food wasnt bad,however wasnt the BEST or the BEST I had tried.It was quite dry also the dishes we ordered lacked flavor(dishes being braised duck,Kung pao chicken,chicken friend rice,soup dumplings and black bean beef).
Also we dealt with 4 different staff,2 were very friendly ,however another 2 seemed quite disinterested .I tried asking one of the staff if the wooden bowls on other guests tables were the famous dumplings id seen on the food reviews id seen before I came.However he seemed quite annoyed I was asking.In my error I called it wontons.He gave a brash NO then walked away.
So I give for my 1st experience an average 3 stars.However I do want to give a 2.5/5.",0
"Firs time in almost 20 years ago. I have some great memories at this place and about some great food I had...and not so fun memory of long waiting times.

What has happened to this place or did my pallet change or get sophisticated so much thru Michelin restaurants, etc.

Food - dude. What happened to soup dumplings. Greasy meat and soup, the broth inside had disgusting white gooey stuff. Dumpling ski was thick. Yuck!!!  And the twice fried noodles...no real ingredient but msg laden sauce.  What happened here?

Ambiance - much better than before but a lot of wasted space and ceiling is just too high for the space. Weird.

Service - not bad for a busy (?) Chinese restaurant

Price - not cheap for a Chinese restaurant",0
"Despite my foodie friends who keep dragging me here, I feel pretty meh every time I visit Joe's.  It's not that I completely dislike the place; I'm no xiao long bao expert, but I appreciate that it's a cheap meal and that the soup is tasty (albeit greasy).  I've generally been ok with every other dish I've tried here too.  So maybe it's the experience itself that puts me off.  You always wait at least 20 min to be seated.  You're always seated with strangers unless your party fills a banquet table (fits 12ish).  The waiters thrive on efficiency and turnaround, and it's pretty common for them to bump you constantly or spill things on you/your coat as they bustle about.  The tables are also really packed tight together.  Much of this is typical to many Chinese restaurants, but I don't think the food is good enough to tolerate all of it simultaneously.  2.5 stars, although maybe the food would bump it up to a 3 for ""just ok.""",0
"I thought this place was good, not great. However, I should say up front that I try to stick to a vegetarian diet so I did NOT try the pork buns... yes that might have swayed my rating. 

... In any case, the most interesting part of the meal for me was the trip to China town and meandering around these small streets finding the place. I brought mum as she was in town sightseeing and she loves the markets in China town. 

The meal, as mentioned, was above average but didn't blow my socks off. We shared a large table with two other groups and ordered: spring rolls, scallion pancakes for appetizers, seasonal vegetables and (for mom) chicken and shrimp in plum sauce. Everything I tried had good flavoring and the tea and rice were pretty standard. 

Maybe next time, I'll have just one pork bun (and possible update my rating -- would have done that this time, but mom hates pork and you have to order them in 8's). 

eh, I guess I'd go back.",0
"My mother and I came here around 3pm on a Saturday to try the soup dumplings that we've been hearing about so much. Waited only 30min with an odd way of calling your ticket numbers (they don't call you in numerical order). 

We ordered just 2 orders of the pork soup dumplings as we had dinner plans. I was disappointed as only 2 out of the 8 soup dumplings I had actually had a little bit of soup in it. The dumpling skin itself was a little dry too. 

Also the place was dirty so it's not exactly a nice place to take out of town guests.",0
"The food is tasty and for a good price, but the restaurant is really crowded and hectic. Not a place to come to for a relaxing meal. You may be asked to share tables with other parties. 

Their soup dumplings and soups are good. I would definitely recommend coming to try their food, but I don't think this is a place I'd come back to often due to the overall ambiance/experience.",0
"I want the service charge from my dinner last night refunded. And I deserve interest and hazard pay. 

You did not earn a tip and shouldn't be able to charge a service charge when service sucked. 

Service was terrible, staff were rude and poorly trained. No communication, literally snatching things off the table under our spoons. My God! You take my plate while I'm still chewing my last bite!?! What jerks!

Chairs were dirty. Literally there was a pea in the debris that I had to wipe off my seat.

The food was fine, nothing special, but the dining experience was horrendous.

We were seated in a terrible location, in the service area, at the top of the stairs to the restroom. I am not exaggerating that there was never a 10 second break without someone inches from our bumping into our table or actually leaning over us and our table. God I miss COVID social distancing after that claustrophobic experience. 

I want my money back. You did not earn a service charge. 
 
Shame on you for treating your guests like this.",0
"Came here because it was named ""best soup dumplings"" in NYC. Had to check them out. 
Loved the community tables, hated that i took the suggestion of another guest on what to order aside from soup dumplings.

We ordered the pork steamed buns, the scallion pancakes and the shanghai noodles with chicken. 
Scallion pancakes were fluffy and flaky and delicious. Sauce they came with was great.
Pork steamed buns were as very good. The sauce they came with really made it with a vinegary twist. Soupy buns are always difficult to eat for me, because to get the full experience you've got to take them in one bite...with the scalding hot temperature of the inside juices and the size of the buns, it's tough to take them down in one mouthful. Possible, but tough. Tasty, for sure.
The shanghai noodles with chicken were a huge disappointment. Also, not what i would have ordered if i hadn't taken advice from a neighboring couple eating their dinner. Bland, difficult to eat with chopsticks (I take responsibility for this - my skills aren't 100%), and just overall a ""blah"" dish. I should have gone with something I know I would have liked, but he was RAVING about how delicious they were, and was eating them when he suggested...really didn't expect such a let down.

Only other thing that was a bit of a bummer was how the staff stood very close to you and seemed to rush. It wasn't a packed night. There were plenty of free tables, and room for other guests at our community table. I felt like a criminal for ordering a water with the check. 

Tea was great, as always. 
Would come back and order something else. 
Bring cash - cash only establishment...but if you forget, there's an ATM in the store across the street with only a $2 fee. 
Worth going for the soupy buns.",0
"I do not understand why the people like this place.
1) the food average
2) not clean
3) crowded 
4) the stuff treats you like they are making you a favor by offering their food.
We ware rushed , overall a really unpleasant experience .
Sorry Joe""s , you turned your business in just a  money making machine",0
"There crab/pork dumplings are crazy good!

Last visit, there was a little mess up with our order. we ordered ONE order of crab and pork dumplings to start and what arrived was one order of crab/pork, and one of pork. I thought maybe the waiter mis-understood me and just blew it off. Oh well! They are delicious and we'll eat them!
BUT! When new costumers sat down and order the same as us, one order of crab and pork, they same thing happened to us! They received two and were very confused.
So beware, there is a waiter that likes to rip you off!

Also, not much other than the Dumplings are good.
I ordered generals chicken and not only was it a crazy small amount of food that came (i mean not even covering half the plate), but it was so covered with sauce it was inedible. Also ordered scallion beef, and there was little to no beef! This plate was covered full, full of grilled onions!",0
"Very disappointing overall. The soup dumplings were quite tasty (although there were many shards of shell in them) and the cold sesame noodles were slightly above average, but everything else was quite below average and service was embarrassingly bad, even for a place not known for its service. Orange chicken was completely inedible (a shoe would have been more tender, had less gristle, and been tastier), the dried beef dish was so bland as to be utterly pointless (and so chewy as to be gross), and the third dish, which I cannot recall the name of but it was some kind of stir fried noodle dish, was mush. Our server clearly could not have cared less, we had to ask for waters four times before we received them, and then they added a 15% tip automatically (we were just a party of four, so not a large group). We were looking forward to it and will not be back. 

P.S. There was no wait at 6pm on a Sunday night, so maybe the place is going downhill and word is getting out.",0
"I visited Joe's Shanghai on my second night in the city and was super excited because I had heard good things. 
We arrived and were hit with that ""cash only"" rule which was like :/ but luckily we had cash on us so we were able to stay. 
We sat down and ordered a bunch of things!
To start we received​ a jasmine tea which was nice  
We started with the pork&crab soup dumplings. Let me tell you... THESE WERE THE BEST! I was so impressed with the flavors and the textures, It was like a ball of heaven. After that, I definitely​ had some higher standards for this place.
We ordered the Szechuan​  beef which was one of the grossest things I have ever seen. It was soupy and definitely​ not what I expected. 
Next was the general tso chicken which was good but not above average
The fried rice and lo mein were​ also good but a little below average in my opinion. 
I will be back here for the soup dumplings but not really for the other things. If you feel passionate about soup dumplings like myself, I definitely​ recommend​ this place.",0
They will charge you 15% service fee for any party size whether you like their service or not. Their service is actually really bad hence three stars. Their dumpling it is great. That is a fact. Service is terrible is also a fact.,0
"It's famous. It was a unique dining experience being seated around strangers, sharing a table trying to avoid awkward glances.
The place is so crowded, understandably so, as everyone is trying to get a taste. 
But I felt uncomfortable and under pressure while eating. At one point all the others on my table were waiting for food when my food arrived. I couldn't not eat since people were lined up outside for my spot, and it wasn't fun eating with people staring at you hungrily, possibly judging how I lacked chopstick skills. It sucked when I dropped 2 of my 6 hot buns. Talk about embarrassment. 

I am a vegetarian by choice so pork flavors didn't seduce me. And I was actually delighted to have dropped those buns. You see, I can't fairly judge the taste of their hot buns. I don't think I tasted anything spectacular though. 

What I can rate is the ambience, quality of service and my dining experience. And they were far from great. 
The 40 minute wait outside wasn't worth it.",0
"Before I go into any details about the food, I want to say that this place is jam packed.  All tables are large round tables that seat approximately 12 people and the table is shared by different parties.  The whole eating experience makes you feel like you are going through a restaurant that operates like a factory (get in--eat--get out).  But hey, gotta figure that they are doing something right if so many people are eating here right?

So I finally had a taste of the famous (aka NYC's best?) dumplings that everyone raves about.....and I wonder what the big deal is.  Although I'm not absolutely certain, my gut tells me that these dumplings are not made in house, but ordered en masse from a dumpling factory that caters to large restaurants in the NYC area.  I find nothing fancy about the quality of the dumpling and the dumpling broth.  I would say this is really about an average marketplace dumpling you would pay a few pennies to eat in asian countries.  Perhaps that is what is so appealing to the crowd that comes here...b/c the taste brings nostalgic memories for those who used to eat at the asian street carts selling dumplings.  However, living in the US for quite some time, I now appreciate quality and a homemade taste more than anything else and would pass on the next opportunity to go to Joe Shanghai's.",0
Consistently listed on top places to get Xiao long bao but it's definitely overrated. There are places in flushing that are infinitely better...,0
"Wait time/ service: I came both on a weekend and weekday for lunch. Didn't have to wait much for a seat. Service is good, but just FYI 18% tip will be included in your bill and it is cash only. 

Food: I got the pork and crab soup dumplings. It comes with 8 and they are very large. I like them more than Din Tai Fung soup dumplings but Nan Xiang XLB is better. The soup is good and so is the skin. However the meat quality could be better. I  got little bites of crab shell or something. 

Overall, worth a try, but felt kind of pricy at $18 after tax and tip. The other food looks good so probably a good spot for a group. The free hot tea is nice on a cold day!",0
"It is easy to say that this restaurant is my top choice for soup dumplings as of right now. I have been here more times than I can count, and their dumplings have never let me down. In regard to all the other food and service, however, I do have to say that it is definitely not the best I've experienced and was oftentimes disappointing. The workers were incredibly rude and not as attentive to their customers' needs.",0
"I came here last night because my boyfriend wanted to try it. 

Maybe we shouldn't have came on valentines day but he wanted to try it after our ski trip. 

We waited 20 minutes... 

They seat you at huge tables with other people.  

We had dirty spoons! 

They didn't offer me water but gave it to everyone else.

 My boyfriend uses the restroom then comes back to tell me the waiter didn't wash his hands when he left the restroom!  I was ready to leave but we didn't. 

The dumplings are horrible they just tasted  so cheap. Cheap meat and greasy. 

Scallion pancakes taste very cheap and greasy, they were saturated in the cheap grease, taste like as if your eating food from someone who never stepped foot in a kitchen before. 

They add on 20 percent service charge (tip) 

I will never come here again!",0
"This place is more of a tourist trap than anything else. There is always a line outside and the wait can be from 20 mins to an hour.  

We came at 9 and it was still packed. We ordered their soup dumplings, pork belly with minced preserved vegetables and Shanghai noodles. 

The soup dumplings had a delicious filing and the broth was yummy but the skin needs work. It was too thick and got hard super fast. 

Their Shanghai noodles were ok in flavor but it was extremely oily. 

Their pork belly with preserved veggies was ok. Portion was a bit small and they could have cut their pork belly into smaller slices. 

Service was non existent. They kept trying to rush us out by asking if we were done ordering.  As soon as we said yes they brought the bill.",0
"Dear Joe --For years I brought many a friend and family to your place, I ranted and raved about those dumplings, I even noted the aloof nature and non English speaking waitstaff as ""authentic."" But this isn't working for me any longer Joe. And it especially angered me last night when my aunt never received her dinner. When we asked your arrogant waiter why he simply said ""no more soft shell crab."" No alternatives were offered, no menu brought to the table, no apology, no explanation, nothing. 

This degree of bad service is offensive and to me, as significant a reason to stay away as neglect of sanitation. From here on I'll be taking my guests for soup dumplings at a place called Grand Sichuan (229 9th ave, blog: thegrandsichuan.com). 

Sorry Joe.",0
"Only tourist eat here.  I've had to come here so many times for tourists and I tell them every single time, that ONLY TOURIST EAT HERE!!!  Now, you must be wondering, ""hey, why is that a bad thing that only tourist eat here?  it must be good that it has so much business?  right?""  NO!  Look around..  There are no locals eating here...  That means that the locals are eating somewhere else...  somewhere better!  If you want Soup Dumplings, go to Shanghai Cafe...  THIS PLACE IS SO BAD!  Their marketer must be a freaking genius!  

Would I go back?  Not if I can help it...  If I could give this place zero stars, I would...   Please read the reviews, everyone that gives Joe's Shanghai anything else then one star is a tourist/out-of-towner/non-local.",0
"For people who wants to try their famous hot snd sour soup, you'll be disappointed. They must have changed their cook that the soup is even worse than those chopsuey restaurants. Juicy bun is probably the only food that is still acceptable.",0
I am very disappointed with Joe's.  I've been going there regularly for as long as they've existed and they've screwed up again.  They have clearly changed their famous dumplings to make them cheaper to produce.  The soup is less flavorful and more oily now.  They changed the formula once before and changed back after a few months.  It is extremely disappointing to see Joe's slash their quality to this extent though.  Bring back the old dumplings now and it will be worth going again.,0
"Crab cream soup dumpling is still as good as it is. Just the service kept getting worse. It's ok to have people share table in regular situation, but they went kinda too far to ask a mom to keep their baby on her lap to get an extra chair.",0
Rude waiting staff. Maybe because they automatically charged 18% service fee regardless of party size. Will never come back. Not worth the hour long wait.,0
"Just wanted to warn people that you are expected to share a table with strangers here.  As a single person I was directed to a table with five other people.  There was one small table with two chairs that was available when I walked in.  As I was walking out (I didn't eat here so can't vouch for the food), I saw that table given to a couple who had walked in after me.  Maybe it's a Chinatown cultural thing?  Guess I will find out at the next place I try!",0
"3.5 stars
I came here with my family to celebrate my sister's birthdayI was super excited since I had heard great things from many friends about this restaurant. 
There were a couple of things I didn't like right off the bat. 
My son and his cousin when to the host to let her know that the whole party was present and she rolled her eyes and ignored them. When I approached her, she waved me off and told me to talk to the gentleman who was seating. 
I don't care how busy the restaurant is, that type of customer service is rude. 
The place itself is pretty nice. The server was polite and took our order quickly. 
We ordered a selection of soup dumplings, vegetable dumplings, duck, sesame chicken, orange beef, vegetable lo mein, tofu and fish. Everything was very tasty, especially the vegetable lo mein, the vegetables were very fresh and the noodles were cooked to perfection. 
Another thing that was quite annoying was that we didn't receive the white rice the platters come with until we were almost done with the platters. We kept asking the waiter when he would be bringing the rice and he just kept saying it was coming. 
The food is very good and they have a big selection but I feel like I have tried better spots with better service.",0
"I came here for dinner with a group of 12 on a recent Monday night.  The place was PACKED at 8:30 and we had to wait a bit for a table (they don't take reservations).  Don't come for this place if you're looking for any sort of charming or cute atmosphere, because you will NOT find it.  They staff is very rushed and abrupt at times.  Luckily much of the food makes up for all of this, but not enough to earn it more than 2 stars from me.  Note, there is no bar and the only alcohol served is beer.",0
"This is a great place for tourists to get the ""Chinatown experience"": the service is sloppy and brusque, the atmosphere is nil, the food is reliably good, the price is right. 

If you live in NYC and want xiao long bao, then Nan Xiang (http://www.yelp.com/biz/nan-xiang-dumpling-house-flushing) is a better bet. The soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai were good, but there are lots of obvious tourist concessions. For example, what should have been a mix of black vinegar and julienned ginger to accompany the dumplings was instead shockingly mild and sweet, with no heavy, vinegary tartness. I guess they think tourists will soak their dumplings in sauce and then be turned off by what should be an abrasive flavor. Also, this location uses shredded cabbage to line the steam baskets, presumably because xiao long bao newbies may rip the dumpling skins when plucking them from atop whole cabbage leaves. Convenient, but this meant that there were unnecessary cabbage bits on the underside of my dumpling. Blah!

The crab soup dumplings are very starkly crab-flavored, more than most other xiao long bao establishments. The rest of the food I've tried here is decent and filling: the cold noodles are nicely coated in soy and sesame paste with barely a hint of vegetable, and curiously tossed tableside. The jellyfish is nice and crisp. The scallion pancake is fresh, flavorful, and not too greasy. Despite the adjustments made for those new to xiao long bao, the food here in general is better than at the Joe's Shanghai location in Flushing (http://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-flushing), which verges on too greasy.

If you come in a group of fewer than 6, you're probably going to be sharing a table with another party. This kind of sucks when there is a lazy susan in the middle of the table and less considerate dinner partners will spin your food away from you. 

Qian W's review is totally accurate re: the way they ""served"" the dishes. These guys may secretly be cornhole champs. Most impressive was that when clearing baskets to make room, and there was one dumpling left, they grabbed the tongs, speared the poor dumpling, and hurled crudely it into another basket - all without tearing the skin of the dumpling. Dang.",0
"After reading reviews about this place, the long wait on the street just to try their food was not worth it. 40 minute wait, and service was horrible. They rush your order as soon as you sat down. The tables were very close to each other and the place is pack. We didn't even get a chance to open the menu. And they rush us.. The pan fry dumplings was not fully cook. We order the Xiao ling bao, with crab meat and it did not meet our expectations.",0
"The food taste is terrible! Noodle, crab bun, wodun all among the worst I ever had. No idea where thousands of 4 star reviews cane from.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is more known for their soup dumplings (listed under their appetizers section) than any other food item on their menu.

To be honest, it tasted okay. My friends and I ordered the crab and pork one and the pork one was definitely more tasty than the crab. I think its because of the skin for the dumplings that made it taste different. 

other than that, just be prepared to sit with strangers and share a table with them as well. there's usually a long wait for this restaurant and this restaurant is CASH only.",0
"Average chinese food, so an average rating, 3 stars. Nothing bad, but nothing special EXCEPT for the tasty soup dumplings. The general tsaos was good. The pan fried dumpling and lo mien were meh. Overall, not a bad meal at all, just not my favorite in the area",0
"Honestly think this place is a tourist trap. Sure their XLBs look plump, but the meat seems very mushy and the sauce is very thick and oily. Luckily, there was no wait when I got there on a weekday for lunch, but I wouldn't waste my time waiting to try their XLBs. My stomach felt funny afterwards - probably from the oil. 

Granted I haven't tried any of their other dishes, but XLBs here are overhyped.",0
"Pretty good but not great. The broth in the dumplings isn't as flavorful as Din Tai Fung in LA which is my only basis of comparison because Dallas doesn't have soup dumplings worth eating. The dumplings are pretty sizable which means lots of broth, but the skin also has to be thicker to support everything inside. It was super crowded and I felt like 80% of the people in there were tourists like me. We also ordered this GREAT pork tripe stir fry dish that was ridiculously delicious. The tripe was tender and perfectly flavored, it really made up for my slight disappointment in the soup dumplings. If I could do it all again, I wouldn't go out of my way on a short trip to NYC to come out here.",0
"My daughter found this place while we're in NY Chinatown because she missed the Bing dumplings in Fremont, CA. The reason for the 2 stars because it only accepts cash and automatically charge tip even with only 4 people. I do not like this type of restaurants, no one carries $100+ cash to have dinner. We normally tip 20% if the place has good service but 18% tip automatically charged for 4 is a no no.
The place is a very nice place, the service people were attentive and fast. All the dishes were quite tasty but on the salty and sweet side. The kids liked the soup dumplings although not as good as the ones in California. My wife beef stewed spicy noodles soup was very spicy but tasty. The shredded crispy chicken was good according to my son and spicy beef was excellent by my daughter. My noodles were ok.
We will not come back here regardless of how ok it is.",0
"I wish Asian restaurants had more etiquette and concern for their customers. I felt like this place wanted to cram as many people as possible so we were put right next to their trashcan, ugh. Unfortunately, we couldn't ask for another table because it would have been a long wait. 

The food wasn't particularly good either. I thought their xiao long bao was average. Din tai fung and Mama Lus make it better. The shrimp and chive dumpling in broth, turnip shortcake, Singapore chow fun were all average. 

Service was horrendous- and they automatically charge 15% tip to the bill! It made me so mad. 

Restaurant is also dirty and smelly. Chinatown in general is dirty and smelly. I don't know how they got an A grade but this place doesn't deserve it, it's more like a C. Never never come here.",0
"Upon arrival,  there was a very long line.  Based on the reviews we decided that it must be worth the wait.   Were we wrong. ..  The fried dumplings,  scallion pancakes,  duck dish, and chicken dish were mediocre at best. We've had better at corner Chinese carryouts that also serve subs.  The soup dumplings were very good, but not worth the wait. 
My husband, son and I all agree ""one and done. ""  We will not go back.",0
Decent Americanized Chinese food. Different than other places in Chinatown. Quick service. Good place for getting your Chinese food coma.,0
I had lunch yesterday while on a break from jury duty. The dumplings were excellent. I would definitely like to come back for  dinner when I have ore time and can try more things.,0
"The soup inside the pork dumpling is jam packed with oil/grease and MSG (which is why you are SO thirsty after you leave this place).

i mean, its good, you just leave feeling gross.  

yung chow fried rice is good here.

they do not have a good selection of seasonal chinese vegetables.

the restaurant feels DIRTY.  i saw a baby roach on the wall beside me once.

shanghai fried noodles are good here, as well as scallion pancakes.  and shanghai rice cakes.",0
Service was terrible and after that the food quality takes second place. The focus was on getting you in and out as soon as possible to maximize the turns on the tables - while the food is tasty it is not that much better than other restaurants - Vanessa's fried dumplings in Williamsburg are just as good and at less than half the price,0
"I first heard of Joe's Shanghai from friends (who are not new yorkers or foodiea) and the yelp review convinced me to try it out. I normally go to Nang,x k Xiang in Flushing Queens. I waited in line for 45min and Joe's Shanghai was not worth it at all. The dough was tough and not delicate. The texture was all wrong. The dumpling inside was a bit mushy although the flavor was okay. People who think Joe's Shanghai is worth standing in line for have never had authentic dumpling soup or juicy bow. There were a lot of white people in line and hipsters which is the first hint that this was going to be bad. I will never go back. Please try Nang Xiang if you haven't.",0
"Don't trust the 7000 reviews. Had way better dumplings elsewhere. The soup wasn't clear and felt like the meat wasn't cleaned. The service was good though and portion size was good. So if you care about quantity over quality, this is the place.",0
"I haven't come here in a very long time because the line is always so long, but today there was no wait since I went early.  However, I must say I was very disappointed.  I had to sit in a table with 2 other groups and we barely had any rooms for our foods.  I ordered two orders of soup dumplings and 2 sides, vegetarian duck and kau fu.  The bean curd skins were over cooked on top and there was very little mushrooms.  The kau fu was too sweet.  

Most people probably come here for the soup dumplings so let's get there now.  First, the skin was so thick.  Second, the soup was also thick and my brother had some that wasn't fully cooked and he saw some red, blood juice come out.   Third of all, it was so salty I had to drink so much tea.  

Then to end it off when I was leaving I saw that they had a C for sanitation.  Getting a C is really difficult, that means they must really not clean at all then.  It was especially disappointing because I remember how it used to taste and it tasted a lot better.",0
"Should we talk about the delicious soup dumplings or about the fact that the Health Department closed the kitchen last Friday night at 7:00 when they showed up unannounced and saw whatever they saw back there. We were seated promptly, ordered our food and then waited and waited. Normally the food comes out immediately but last Friday our waiter kept coming over to apologize. When he said that it would be twenty more minutes before our food would arrive, I noticed many people getting up and leaving. At that point, having eaten there many times before, I sensed something was terribly awry. I asked a woman who works there if something was wrong in the kitchen. She did not hesitate to express her annoyance that the Health Department had shown up at such a busy time unannounced. I guess the fact that they saw something serious enough to warrant closing the kitchen immediately didn't phase her. Well it phased me and my husband and I can't say we'll be rushing back any time soon!",0
"Came here on the Sunday afternoon with my parents because they haven't gone in a while and was craving Shanghai food. The wait was of course really long and even when seated, everyone was bunched up. Ordered the soup buns, some noodles, and a few appetizers. The soup buns were pretty good and usual. However, we started eating the other food, things got saltier and saltier. My dad whose a usual picky eater and used to love this place dislikes his last visit and I know he won't be coming back for a while if he wanted to get Shanghai food.",0
"The worst customer service ever. This place was way too packed and we were forced to share a table with other 2 groups ""without asking"". The waiter who served our table was awful. He spilled the clam soup all over his shoulder and pants and didn't try to take care of it. We regretted so bad that we picked this place. Actually the dumplings which this place is famous for are very good but the other food was overpriced and didn't taste good at all. Don't order ""Double cooked pork"". That was disgusting. There are lots of better Chinese place out there. We will never go back for sure.",0
"I ordered their dumpling which is a MUST order for shanghai restaurant, pretty good food but the service is average. The place itself is kind of crowded and I don't like the fact that i have to share table with someone else.",0
"It's fine. Nothing great, but not bad. The soup dumplings are well-made",0
"Tried this place because all of the good reviews. It was just...ok. The soup dumplings arrived hot, so I just don't understand how they didn't impress me! We got soup dumplings, fried pork dumplings, scallion pancakes, and general Tso's chicken. China town in Honolulu has wayyy better soup dumplings!",0
"Completely overrated. There seems to be a lot of hype around this restaurant, and so the wait is pretty long (~30 minutes). However, the service was pretty abysmal. I felt like I was being hurried into just leaving so there would be more space for other customers. Also, you may get seated with random strangers at a large table if there is no room. The soup dumplings were ok; I've have the same quality in other Chinatown restaurants. The crab soup dumplings were better than the normal pork ones, in my opinion.",0
"We really wanted to try this! Went all the way down only to find it has a C rating? To get a B is hard to do, so to have a C it must be filthy. What a huge disappointment after coming all that way. Diners beware",0
"I went to this place multiple times with family and friends. I never had a real bad experience. But the other night, I went with friends and the waiter was RUDE. We haven't done or said anything to warrant the RUDENESS. A friend had asked for napkins and he hid them under the teapot and plates. He asked again and instead of answering, he mumbles under his breathe in Chinese saying, I gave you the napkins. Next he gives us a pot of tea that has no flavor and color. It was just HOT WATER. I asked the guy for another pot and he was rude about it. Took the pot and gave us cold tea. My friend confronted him and said we haven't done anything to deserve such service and attitude. He walked away and hid in the kitchen. I would never go back! The food isn't even worth it. Prices is overpriced for the size offer. My friends like this place so we went but after this experience, I wouldn't even bother. Didn't even bother to tip the waiter well. Paid for our dinner and left",0
"This place is pretty decent. Their XLB is pretty juicy. However, when comparing this to Ding Tai Fung it just doesn't compare. I'm not that big of a fan of DTF but I do like the skin of DTF's dumplings. Here it's kind of just big saggy and juicy. It's tasty but probably not worth waiting in line for. Luckily when I went it was pretty empty and got seated right away. 

I also got the rice cake noodle soup which was actually pretty good. The restaurant is small so we sat next to another couple really close. 

I wasn't too sure what the service charge was on the bill. I asked the waiter if that's tip and he said yes. Hopefully that's really what he means because I didn't leave anything else. lol",0
Probably had too high expectations based on the great reviews. Unfortunately the soup dumplings here didn't meet my standard.,0
"Visited on a Thursday night for dinner and waited around 30 minutes to be seated, so it's a bit of a wait. This place is also cash only. 

The pork dumpling was definitely my favorite and is well-deserved as one of the most popular dishes. We also ordered the crab XLB, green beans and the flat noodles, which were nothing too special. 

While the pork dumpling is the star of the show, the overall experience was not worthy of the wait considering how every other entree left a lot to be desired.",0
"I can see the charm. It is a classic Chinese joint in the city. The soup dumplings are great but not incredible. Nan Xiang has a +1 on these. But if you've never had them, then get here and try them. It's definitely a must try once spot but I'd leave it at that. 

The service was cumbersome. We were quoted 25 minutes and were seated an hour later. Cmon guys... 

As for the rest of the dishes, I hate to say that you should order the General Tso's or Sesame chicken but honestly, that's probably what you should do. There's nothing traditional about the menu options. I guess that's what they're all about; being the go to spot that caters to those who think that fried chicken nuggets covered in a spicy, sweet sauce is authentic. Whatever, who am I kidding, the Sesame chicken WAS delicious.",0
"Extremely rude service! The food is not bad, but just ok, I've had better Shanghai food. I wish they would not take their customers for granted and that waiters would be more respectful.",0
"I'd give this place 4 stars for the Xiao long bao, or soup dumplings (XLB) alone, but the rest of the food is suspect. Thickener in the Hong shao (brown sauce) dishes?! Nuh-uh.

The XLB are about as good as they get really. I've been to the touristy Nan Xiang in Shanghai and Ding Tai Feng in Taipei. Joe's didn't have the Japanese tourists coming by the busload, but the XLB themselves are just as good. The skins are thin, the soup is plentiful, and the whole thing is full of salty, meaty goodness. It's not my favorite food in the world; it can be a bit greasy due to the solid collagen that needs to be stuffed into the dumplings for the soup effect, but I crave it from time to time.

I've recently taken a liking to good Shanghai food, and unfortunately, this place really doesn't deliver on that front. I ordered the carp tail in brown sauce (Hong shao hua shui) and it came in this starch thickened brown sauce that was just off putting. The fish itself was cooked perfectly, but Shanghai style Hong Shao dishes should have a runny soy and sugar based sauce. The sauce here was just gunky. Joe's added the worst part of cantonese food, the starch thickener, to one of the tastiest shanghainese dishes. I seriously discourage ordering any of the shanghai tropes at this restaurant despite its name, but if it's XLB you want, this is a good spot.",0
"The food is a bit pricey ($15+ for general tso's) but delicious. It was my first time trying their soup dumplings. They were good in my opinion, but personally I prefer fried which is why I wasn't too crazy about them. I also tried the scallion pancakes and they were amazing! 

The only thing I didn't like is that you have to share tables with strangers (must be a cultural thing)! It was the quietest dinner I've ever had with my boyfriend. It makes it really uncomfortable to have a private conversation, not to mention there's barely enough room for your food since table space is limited. If you decide to come here make sure to bring a bunch of friends so you get your own table. Also, cash only!",0
"Coming from LA (aka the land of the dumplings/soup dumplings), I was expecting Chinatown in NYC to get it down to a science. Sad to say, I was not impressed with the food here. Was it good? Yes. Was it spectacular that it needs to be set apart from the rest of the soup dumplings and pork fried dumplings? Absolutely not. 
The waiters and waitresses working here are also not the nicest. 
I will say that whatever chicken dish they have on their menu is actually cooked perfectly.",0
"The service was HORRIBLE and the food was mediocre. The waiters had absolutely no manners. They screwed up our order and then had the nerve to give US attitude when we corrected them. They also  automatically added their tip to the bill, which I found offensive. They didn't deserve a tip to begin with. This is one place I definitely would not revisit!!!!",0
"The food was great, but service was horrible.  The fried rice was very good as was the General Tao's Chicken.  We also enjoyed the spring rolls and hot and sour soup. I won't visit again, based solely on the service.  There are plenty of other equally good Chinese restaurants in the area.",0
"This is the problem of going to Taiwan and try the famous soup dumplings in taipei. 

now nothing compares.

The dumplings here are too big, skin is too thick, and the meat inside not juicy or flavor enough.

But they will do until I go back to taipei.",0
"After years of wanting to check this place out, I finally did so and unfortunately found it pretty lacking. First, the soup dumplings, what they are known for. Not soupy and I'm guessing the top of the dumpling should not be dried out and hard. Disappointing. We also had some cold meat dishes and found them pretty mediocre and a little salty. The shredded turnip cake and pea shoots were quite good, however.

Lastly, the prices are a little high for china town and the place is very cramped. It seems they have gotten a little complacent and I hope they can get back to what earned them such a high rating in the first place.",0
"I've had Joe's Shanghai bookmarked for quite some time and was looking forward to some delicious xiao long bao.  I feared that we would have to wait but to our surprise we were seated right away.  The tables are very close to each other and some parties share a table with others as well.  

We ordered 2 orders of xiao long bao (8 for $8 and change) and an order of Shanghai chow mein (however they called it something else, like stir fried flat noodle or something).  The xiao long baos were big and full of broth and served piping hot.  So much juice that I even squirted some on the table as I bit into it, however, the dumplings were bland and even the vinegar tasted diluted and the ginger wasn't fragrant at all.  The xiao long bao held up pretty well with only one served punctured.  The Shanghai chow mein was standard, plentiful and had a little more flavor.

Service was solid.  It's cash only and they automatically add gratuity on the bill.  If I recall correctly our bill was about $28.  Joe's Shanghai can't compare to my beloved Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, and I've even enjoyed xiao long bao more in San Francisco.  2.5ish rounded up.",0
"Cash only but service was fine. We only waited about 20 minutes when there were couple parties in front of us. After we ordered, food came out really soon. Soup dumpling and noodle soup were lukewarm. I usually have no problem with meaty heavy food but I couldn't take more than 2 dumpling.",0
"The dumplings were good. I tried the crab ones. There was an abundance of soup in them compared to other places I've eaten at! We also got some sort of stir fried noodle dish that was pretty tasty, as well. 

However, I felt uneasy at this place due to the aesthetics and scent it was giving off. We were seated next to their recycle containers and for the duration of my meal, I couldn't really enjoy my food because there was a strong sour odor I couldn't ignore coming from them. 

The employees also kept coming in & out of this closet behind them and had to remove the recycle bins back and forth to open the door to get into this closet. At one point, one moved the bin too far out and it brushed up on my arm and it really grossed me out!

Sorry I can't overlook this one and regardless how good the dumplings were, I can't shake this one off.",0
"It has been a disappointment.  Its food is not what it used to be, the quality was degraded.  The waiter service was very poor, not polite and friendly at all.  I got better service from any noodle shop in China Town than I got from Joe's Shanghai.  

I would NOT recommend this place.",0
"Easily the most overrated place I've ever eaten at. The 5 star reviews have to be fake. 
We ordered soup dumplings which were nasty, pork fried dumplings which were over cooked, Sichuan spicy beef which the meat had a weird slimy consistency and Sea-bass which was just weird the way it was cut and the sauce sucked.
Don't go to this place, the service is terrible also.
Way overpriced and overrated, there are way better ways of spending your money in this city.",0
"Oh Yelp, you led me astray with this one. Best dim sum? Really?! I mean, the food wasn't horrible, but let's not get crazy. It was good enough (especially the scallion pancakes) but the waitstaff was completely indifferent bordering on rude. My friend and I were seated at a larger table (""You sit over here! And you sit there!"") and had a stranger join later, which was kind of awkward. We were given menus, but never offered drinks beyond the standard tea. Food came fast but nobody really cared whether we liked it or not. Seems like staff was more preoccupied with getting us served and out the door as fast as possible. They also add service fee to all orders but then make it look like tipping is still needed. And CASH ONLY? What is this?! Anyways, this place definitely doesn't deserve all the rave it gets. Skip.",0
"Two stars for the first time I ate at this place (when I was also tipsy from a prior engagement and probably didn't know any better, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt). ZERO for the second. Overhyped, overrated, overdone. 

I took my dad who was visiting from Korea here based on Joe's reputation (and that inebriated first visit), despite the notoriously long waits. I'm used to hurried service in crowded Asia-town joints in general, but this was ridiculous. The server was practically shouting at us to order before our butts had even touched down in our chairs (no hyperbole). We requested a few more minutes, whereupon we were provided with 40 seconds of peace to skim the menu. We quickly ordered some requisite soup dumplings and sautéed black mushrooms with bamboo shoots. The black mushrooms were burnt, and the bamboo shoots (and this is coming from someone who is practically a panda, I love bamboo so much) were disgusting. The xiao long bao were obviously hurried, and quite honestly, I much prefer the frozen xiao long bao Boyfriend's mom defrosts for us at home on idle Sundays over this. On top of that, you know, 20% gratuity tacked on to the receipt for... what?

Conclusion? Joe's is nothing more a slap-in-the-face reminder of how easy it is to fall for name value in NYC and be bitterly, bitterly disappointed.",0
"Joe's Shanghai lovers might hate me for this but, this place is alright, I have eaten more authentic food right here in Chinatown. Also, having grown up in South East Asia, I can be a asian food snob.

So, the wait is usually long to get - about 20-40 depending on the time of week you are there. Once you go in you sit at large communal tables which is really cool. As everyone knows, Joe's is really famous for their soup dumplings and they are pretty good, especially the crab ones. However, otherwise the food feels like Americanized chinese food. 

I would explore more places in Chinatown than go here again. Any restaurant that keeps me wanting more is where I return but, Joe's Shanghai..umm not so much!",0
"Chinese.  Known for their soup dumplings.

Several years ago this place used to be good.  Venturing to this location and the Flushing location for their good dumplings.  However, as of late their dumpling quality is not as good.  The soup doesn't have too much flavor to it anymore and the quality has gone down.

However, if you are here not for the dumplings, but for the other food.  Their Shanghai noodles are still great, along with the Shanghai Mei Fun.  The rice cakes are a little oily, but still reasonably good.   Their hot and sour soup isn't so bad either.  If you want to try a hiddle gem.  You should get the fried chinese bread with condensed milk.  It's a nice little sweet treat.

If you want better dumplings, try Shanghai Cafe in Chinatown",0
"The entrance is crowded and reeks.
Service is mediocre at best. You are seated at a round table with strangers, there not enough room on the table with all the dishes. When asked for forks they just ""throw"" it on the table. Food regular Chinese.
BTW they add 15% service charge and didn't provide receipt had to ask for it.",0
"The food is good but service is very poor. I liked the pan fried noodles, the buns, dumplings, and vegetable dishes. The dishes were surprisingly fresh and tasty. There were six of us but we were still expected to share a table when the lunch rush was over. Go because of the chef, but anticipate rude service.",0
"Like some other reviews on here, I too was told by my friend in NY that Joe's Shanghai was so much better than Ding Tai Fung in Arcadia. In fact she said she couldn't even eat DTF anymore because Joe's Shanghai was so good. 

The XLB at Joe's was decent, but no where near the best. I think they focus too much on the ""soup"" part of soup dumpling, making their wrapping too thick and their soup too much. The meat was almost like an afterthought. I prefer my rice paper wrapping thinner, and the meat more hearty. Joe's meat was kind of like a lame meatball patty. However, I did like that they provided little tongs so you can pinch the top of the XLB so they won't break. 

Their green onion pancake was atrocious. Soo bad. It was super greasy and falling apart. I know it's not the healthiest thing to begin with, but it was so greasy that the top layer and the bottom layer of one pancake was slipping and sliding with each other. 

If you are not too familiar with this place, don't be weirded out if you are seated at a big table with another group. That's how they get the line going. 

BTW, I suggest Dumpling House in Arcadia for really good dumpling if you are from socal.",0
Waited for 1.5 hrs on Christmas Day and was seated at a big round shared table.  This place was overhyped as I was letdown by the crab and pork xiao long bao but liked the steamed sea bass.,0
Trader Joe's has better Chinese food in its frozen food section. this place is so mid and so overpriced.,0
"Is Joes Shanghai really the highest rated and most popular Chinese restaurant in all of Chinatown New York?  I really don't get it - especially after waiting for 2 hours to get a spot.  Still - I think I need to give it the benefit of the doubt because there is a good chance I might have ordered all the wrong things to satisfy a group of 7 extremely hungry but picky eaters who along with myself had been on a less-than-halfway point of a marathon journey muscling our way through Manhattan from Wall Street to Harlem all on foot.

I personally thought Joe's Shanghai was pretty average.  The whole fried sweet and sour fish was much more entertaining to look at than it was to eat - very bland and worst was not all of the flour was cooked.  That was a first for me...  The shrimp lomein tasted underwhelming and ridiculous but the scallion pancakes were a nice rebound as was some of the clear broth soup which might have had about three shrimps in it.  I know I am going to get a lot of heat for this (and this is more my problem) but I don't really don't get the craze about the dumplings as I was told these were "" so like the best things ever"" - they weren't.  And I realize this is all coming from people who are from like Flagstaff, AZ, and Frederick, MD.  I am told it's a ""textural exercise"" more so than a tasting experience.  Whatever.

I absolutely love Chinese cuisine and when I think of it - I expect an orgasmic explosion of flavor and no I don't mean in a General Tsao's Chicken way.  It pains me to say it but I thought this was a major disappointment.  But I am glad we tried it.",0
"Went for dinner on a tuesday night around 6ish, there was no wait! (Probably bc it was really cold out). Pretty decent soup dumplings - a 3-star bc of the price (if only wage inflation mimicked food inflation....) we also got the shanghai noodles which are like stirfried thick noodles with pork - delicious, not too much veggies however.",0
"I'll make it simple ---- nothing is edible here except the soup dumpling. 

Honestly I don't get the line that builds up everyday outside of this restaurant. The food simply fails as authentic Shanghainese food --- hell, it even fails as Chinese food period. 

Everything is really extremely overly unnecessarily greasy and the worst dish here has to be the fried tofu and vermicelli soup. Not only is it NOT authentic, the vermicelli wasn't even cooked through. 

There're so many Shanghainese places around and not too far from this location; save the wait.",0
"Friends have recommended this place to me so much. Ended up getting the soup dumplings and they were okay. At first, I enjoyed them though they felt a bit one-note, but as I kept eating I started to feel sick. I don't think the pork fat they use in the broth in the soup dumplings is particularly good. Either it was sort of spoiled or it was just too much fat for my tummy (which is ironic because my belly has some fat storage heh), so I won't be coming back.",0
"Came here and got the crab and pork soup dumplings, pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, szcechuan beef, eggplant. 

I think people have their own preferences, and I don't want my crab dumplings to have that much of a seafood flavor. As for the pork one, the soup seemed a bit lighter than I'm used to. However, overall the dumplings are pretty large and consequently there's more of everything. What wasn't to my liking was how the skin is thicker and the meat took multiple bites. When you are eating it, it's not bite sized and it doesn't quite fit in the spoon. I thought that took away from the experience and made you focus on the skin a bit more (which is obviously bland).

The scallion pancake was interesting as the outside was crispy, but the inside layer was very soft and almost a mushy layer. I prefer pancakes more chewy and crispy.

The beef was so heavily battered that you couldn't really taste the beef anymore. It's likely that they put a lot of cornstarch and baking soda. The sauce was good, but the beef just ruined the dish.

The eggplant was exactly what you would expect. Very oily and salty. The pork with it was really good though. Very nicely flavored with all the oil.

Overall this place I think is over hyped. It's not a pleasant experience there and don't think many Chinese people would consider it a place they have to go to....",0
"1) Long wait-- at least 40 minutes on a good day
2) Overwhelmingly crowded even at 10 PM
3) Sub-par dumplings and noodles

Go somewhere else!",0
"I loved this place. I did. The wait and sitting with strangers were so worth the soup dumplings. 
Then we went, ordered soup dumplings - only soup dumplings, which we reiterated twice - and received beef and broccoli or something. I told the waiter about our wrong dish, and instead of apologizing, he condescendingly told me I was wrong and had received what I ordered. I repeated that no, we had certainly ordered soup dumplings, and he (even more condescendingly, in a ""silly, erratic woman"" kind of way), told me I clearly didn't remember what I had ordered. 
2 stars, because if you get the soup dumplings they are quite good. 
Go to Shanghai Cafe. Just as good, less of a wait, you can sit alone, and the waiters aren't so horribly rude.",0
"Just left this place..after bragging to our kids we received the absolute WORST SERVICE ever. We literally had to ask for everything we got, drinks included, multiple times as well as having to stop random workers for cutlery and even rice. I'm hoping it wasn't because we were 2 men with small 3 kids but I cant believe that's not the case.  Extremely disappointed and will never return.",0
"Not really sure where to start here...obviously this place is extremely well rated, but I guess I had high hopes. I will say it was a 100% authentic Chinatown experience from start to finish, but I've definitely had better!

Came here on a Sunday around lunch time so there was obviously a wait - we put our name down and waited about an hour (although they only said 30 min). You wait outside and listen for your number to be called. They have some seating outside but barely and it's a pretty busy street, especially when cars go by (the sidewalk is extremely narrow).

Once we were seated, the service was pretty slow. It was communal seating and 8 of us (tables are for 10), but we actually had 2 parties of 1 sitting with us, which was surprising. They ended up chatting the entire time and when one didn't realize it was cash only, the other paid for his entire meal, which was so sweet and heartwarming to see. 

We ordered the soup dumplings which is what they're known for, which had a lot of flavor but were extremely messy to eat! The spoons that they had for them only fit about half the dumpling, so you ended up with soup all over your plate. It comes with 8 dumplings though, so that was definitely a deal. We also got the scallion pancakes, which, although not quite what they traditionally should be, were fantastic. 

The menu overall was pretty hard to navigate and didn't have many descriptions, so it was hard to know what you were getting. I ended up having better luck looking through the Yelp photos and asking what the pictures were and ordering based off of that. I ended up getting the fried Shanghai noodles, which were good but didn't have a ton of flavor. Ended up pouring sauce all over it to help! 

In general, nothing felt really clean and it was kind of a circus, but I guess that's part of the experience! Also, cash only, so be prepared) although you could easily have a full meal including tax and tip for under $10! I'd recommend coming with a group so that you can try a bunch of different things, but just note it's not super easy to get seated!

The one thing that REALLY grossed me out was the C rating. I know there is controversy over how those are earned, but at a place that already feels very grimy to begin with, definitely left feeling nauseous just knowing it had a C. Hopefully they'll work on fixing it, but it seems like they had a enough business and are so highly rated that it clearly isn't affecting business much so who knows how important it is to them!",0
"Service was typical and the food came out extremely fast. 

Pork soup dumplings were rancid and sour I almost threw up. These were the worst soup dumpling I've ever had. 

Scallion pancake was decent and super crispy but they fry it in very old oil. 

Crispy noodles were good. Large portions and good flavor.

Joes is a decent place for fast American style Chinese food, but I would recommend going somewhere else for soup dumplings. Maybe my dumplings were old but there was definitely something very off by them.",0
"Soup dumplings are good, not amazing or better than the streets of flushing. The food is really good, the decor is pretty bad. Old chairs and table, and waiters will watch your every move. It was a bit awkward. Food was delicious, if I'm in the area I will def go again! 

Food recommendations:

Braised pork shoulder
Soup dumplings 
Sea bass
Any fried rice 
Hunan pork w shrimp 

Can't go wrong with anything honestly. There is a wait and expect to sit with a random group of people, which makes the experience fun.",0
"Sometimes disappointing, sometimes delicious. I would prefer consistency but I won't stop visiting this place.",0
"TOURIST TRAP!

The minced chicken corn soup and clams in ginger sauce were both too salty while the pan fried noodles was so under seasoned. We tried both the soup dumplings and they were really subpar. Please do yourself a favor and go to Noodle Village they have the best soup dumplings in town. The server also applied an automatic 18% GRATUITY  on our PARTY OF TWO and when I was 69 cents short ( cash only and again the tips already included) he showed an attitude demanding for it and stood right by me watching as I was combing through my purse to make sure I do not any change on me. It's just horrible.",0
"Save your money & appetite.  The ambiance was okay, the food was mediocre, but the service was awful.  These people were not only unpleasant, but ""out of there way"" rude.  At one point, our server (AKA: family member forced to work) literally tossed a bowl of rice on the table near our four-year-old daughter.  We practically had to beg for water during our meal, and then the bill at the end of our meal.  When we walked out of the restaurant two of the workers were passed out on a few chairs in broad daylight, which was slightly amusing.  However, to make matters worse we walked through Little Italy and absolutely regretted eating at Joe's Shanghai.",0
"Being a native New Yorker I knew this place was basically a overhyped tourist trap yet I always still give it a chance once or twice a year especially moving to this new location. However, I must say this place is not worth the wait. We waited for 20 minutes to be seated then ordering our food we had to wait another 20-30 minutes trying to get our food. The tables that were next to us all had delayed dishes coming and you can sense how we all wanted to just cancel our dishes and leave but the waiter would say it's already made yet it still hasn't come. There is definitely something that management needs to work on in the kitchen because this tardiness is unacceptable. My suggestion for those who want something worth the quick wait, checkout my go to, Shanghai 21.

Edited review:
I had to change this from a two star to one star while sitting at the restaurant writing this review because after our dish came it took a bit for just white rice to come. Then there was a screaming match with the cook behind and the waiters. I'm thinking the cook must have been on a extended break while rows of tables were waiting forever. Horrible...",0
"I just can't justify giving this place higher than 3 stars. Yes, it's good. But 5-star, crazy-hype, mob-out-the-door worthy? No.

CRAB & PORK SOUP DUMPLINGS/PORK SOUP DUMPLINGS (aka xiaolongbao aka xlb):
The skin on these is thicker than at Din Tai Fung, but the plus side is that it allows each dumpling to hold more soup. The xlb here are certainly juicy, filled with plenty of meat and soup. An order per person will nearly fill you up, surprisingly. 

SCALLION PANCAKE:
I was underwhelmed by these. They did the job of filling me up, but they weren't as crispy, savory, or flaky as so many other places offer.

All in all, our total was only $10 each for 3 dishes! It's a good deal, that's for sure. But the experience...that's where it's lacking. 

EXPERIENCE:
Plan to wait for at least half in hour in the mob that gathers outside. Once your name is called, you'll likely be seated at a communal table with other parties. Then, due to the large number of people and constant need to get customers in and out, you'll encounter some pretty unfriendly service. I've been to plenty of great Chinese restaurants with poor service, and I generally take it as a given. But here, it just seemed a step below. Water spilling on people, waiters bumping into your chair constantly, waiters ignoring you...This is largely due to the fact that they're so ridiculously busy, so I don't know how much I can really blame them. It's more likely the result of the overblown hype of the restaurant.

OVERALL: 
What really irked me about my experience here was the fact that there are SO many equally good or better xlb places in Manhattan. You're in Chinatown, for goodness' sakes! Explore a little! It's certainly tasty, but you're missing out on the myriad of other options available. 

It would be different if they were serving a highly unusual dish that no one else has, but this is not the case. It's not like Joe's is the only place in Chinatown or elsewhere that has xlb, and I think a lot of tourists and others forget that. My recommendation would be to go if there's no wait, but if there is, skip it and try somewhere different.",0
Have not gone back after my bad experience described in previous review. Try tipsy Shanghai or Che Li. There is no need to wait 45 minutes to an hour for this place. None whatsoever.,0
"This place is best known for the soup dumplings. The waiters are shocked if you don't order them. If you do wish to have them get them immediately upon sitting down as they take a bit of time to cook. The soup dumplings here are quite good and I really liked them until I had the crab filled soup dumplings at Shanghai Gourmet. They are even better. The remainder of the food here isn't very memorable, but not bad and certainly well priced.",0
the soup dumpling is the best...others is ok and the service made me speechless...by the way 15％ tips wtf!!!,0
"Well, it's no Din Tai Fung when it comes to soup dumplings, but if you're already in NYC, then this Joe Shanghai's can't be beat at five dollars an order. 

Compared to DTF, the dough of the soup dumpling is much thicker and denser which results in a very different soup dumpling experience.  The broth is bit on the too fatty side without the flavor, but that may also be because the thicker dough off sets whatever flavor the soup has so it's not as pronounced. 

Service is prompt, and I would defer to the other numerous reviews talking about the wait times.",0
Cash only. No extra charge for the waiter bumping your head with his butt every two seconds. It was quite the squishy butt doe.,0
"Came in for a quick bite since I was in the area.

Ended up getting the vegetable dumplings and F2 Seafood Sautéed flat noodles.

The dumplings were not that great IMHO and the noodles were just okay.  Maybe the location in Flushing is better?

The wait time for a table was non existent at around 630pm on a Wednesday, but quickly got busy as I was about to leave.

The free orange slices for dessert were nice.

The service was so-so, but didn't need too much I guess.",0
"kinda got shanghai'ed on service and dumplings were fine but not dandy.

the quick:
if you've had quality dumplings, nothing here will surprise you...
except maybe the lack of service...
except maybe how popular they are...

Try new things where ever you go!  And I've had my west coast Din Tai Fung (http://www.yelp.com/biz/din-tai-fung-arcadia-3#hrid:e2jy9AqWBLo3UehuthFtUA) so it was time see how it's done in the east!  To sum it up, food was probably on par if just a smidge under DTF but the service kills the experience.

If you're an asian customer but don't speak the language you won't get the same service.  At least on my visit, we got pushed into ordering items we didn't want, rushed into finishing and never really enjoyed our meal because of the lack of elbow room.  Felt like we were in the bottom floor of the titanic, wall to wall of patrons.  The white customers got introductions, smiles, handshakes with the manager and a bit more breathing space than us.  Perhaps they were friends with someone but just by observation, they got the only handshakes.

None of the food here made this place a must have.  Same as any other dumpling place you might enjoy.  It was a fun experience, felt like real chinatown meal but I'd just as soon eat back at home, where the food, space, & service appear professional and even keeled.",0
"The dumplings are definitely nothing to write home about. There aren't many GOOD soup dumpling places in the city, but the hype for this restaurant does NOT match up to the actual food provided.",0
"Came here on a Saturday for dinner and was told the wait time was 45min. We walked around Chinatown and amazingly, it was 45min right on the nose! We were taken to the back of the restaurant and the 3 of us were seated at a table set for a dozen. It was super cramped. We ordered the pork and shrimp soup dumplings, which were huge and delish! We also got a stir fry seafood noodle dish, which was a bit on the greasy side. The flavors were excellent, but due to the how hectic it was, the cramped nature of the restaurant, and the craze of dishes being spun on the lazy susan to your party's location, I would give this place 3 stars. It's also cash-only!",0
"Admitting upfront: I can't help but feel like this review is premature.

I went with my girlfriend and we got only two things: the soup filled dumplings and the sesame chicken. I wasn't in the mood for the chicken, but I have a problem with pretty girls, so...

Anyway, the soup dumplings were amazing.  All that juicy, umami, salty, greasy flavor is absolutely spectacular.  Eat 'em with a spoon though, they tend to squirt.

The sesame chicken (which, admittedly, I was not in the mood for) was just ""aight"".  Totally run-of-the-mill stuff, but at least one of the pieces didn't seem cooked all the way.  The rice (which should have come with it, but required us to ask for it--no big deal though, it was a total madhouse when we were eating) was really really good though, oddly enough.  Never have really been impressed with Chinese rice before.

So yeah, given the popularity of this place, I'll admit that my stars probably aren't the most authoritative, and that I'll have to come back to get the real skinny on this joint.",0
"5 star for food, but the service can be rough. Is like I just sat down and already you are trying to rush us out. I get the turning over, but this is over the top. And then that they have a C rating from Sanitation. Thats worst then I ever seen from this place or any for that matter.",0
"Ok another place that has a lot of hype. Yes the dumplings are pretty good but you're in Chinatown with many hole-in-the-wall places that serve soup dumplings for cheaper or the same price that are just as good or better (and you don't have to wait forever). Crab soup dumplings are $6.65 for 8 and pork soup dumplings are $4.65 for 8. Service-wise, they are fast and the food comes out fast too. If you have a small party, they will seat you at a big table with other guests since they are so busy. They do not take credit cards, cash only.

"I think I went in thinking it was going to be like Din Tai Fung.  It was good, but I was over hyped up about this place.",0
"My friends and I had time to kill and wanted to snack on something. So we walked over to Joe's. 

Crazy amount of people out front waiting to be seated. I can tell it's a tourist hot spot. Let's just say there weren't too many Chinese people standing around waiting for some soup dumplings. 

Here's my tip, and what we did. Order to go. 

Just walk right in and go to the cashier. Order the #1 (crab and pork xia long bao). It comes with 8 and it's hot when you get it. We waiting around maybe 15 minutes for it to come out. Then we trotted outside and ate it right next to everyone who were waiting on line.lol. Needless to say, we got some salivating glances as we devoured it. 

The soup dumplings were good! Is something I would wait in that ridiculous line for? Not sure. It had crazy hype so I had high expectations but I've had pretty yummy soup dumplings elsewhere too. I was pretty content with ordering it to go and going on our merry way to the bar around the corner after we ate.",0
"18% tip already included in price, but the service doesn't  match the tip. The waiters were playing their phones or talked with each other at corner. I stayed on my seat and waited 3~4 minutes for service.",0
"Good, not great. 

The soup dumplings are good and satisfying, but it really baffles me when people say it's the best. I mean, I guess I haven't had any that are better than Joe's, but at the same time, I'm still not blown away. Maybe that's just me. 

Everything else is mediocre chinese fare, so in comparison the soup dumplings are amazing. I will say though, that on a cold night, this is a meal that warms your insides and makes you feel good. 

The one in Flushing is about the same.",0
"There have been many reviews for Joe's so I had to try it. I tried 3 different types of dumplings here and they were warranted enough to come here. Tried the Crab Meat with Pork, Pork Meat Soup, and fried dumplings. However, I'm not sure if it was all the hype or in general but it did not blow me away and my expectations were a bit let down. But don't distract from the fact that these soup dumplings are not bad. The service was lackluster though and wasn't really attentive too much besides when we needed the check and when they brought the food. 

I would give it a 3.5/5.",0
"Food is pretty good, the sea bass is really fresh and shrimp dumpling was very good. but super crowded at lunch time and cramped space and noisy.",0
"the soup dumplings were disappointing. The size is large compare to Ding Tai Feng but it is not as juicy as DTF. Also, I think the dumplings were overcooked. There were a couple of broken skin and the soup leaked out. Cash only!",0
"This place came recommended for the soup dumplings. While the dumpling filling (pork and crab) was very flavorful, the dough of the dumpling was very thick. But that surely couldn't keep the soup inside the dumplings. The dumplings were stuck to the bottom of the steamer because there wasn't enough cabbage lining under it so when we tried to lift the dumplings, all the soup leakes out. All in all, just some regular dumplings you get in any other Chinese restaurant

We also had the scallion pancakes but they were quite greasy. I have had them in Beijing and those were more layered with more scallions in them.

We also had the fried octopus, shredded beef with pepper, beef and rice cake and mei fun. Again, nothing special with these food but they were well made. 

The food itself was very affordable. The ambiance barely gets 2/5. However, this place is considered one of the oldest and  authentic restaurants so ambiance surely reflects that! 

The place was packed with lots of people waiting at the door trying to get a seat on a Thursday night",0
"We had to check out joe's Shanghai since it's one of the most reviewed restaurants. Pork soup dumplings is good!both the hostesses were sweet and nice! But the place is so cramp and so loud! They asked you if you're ok to share table with others, if not then you have to wait longer. We couldn't enjoy our dinner coz incoming customers are standing and waiting next to our table. I was afraid that they may accidentally knock out our food. Another customer who was waiting for a table reached over our table to take pics of the picture frames on the wall! Which was really annoying! They only accept cash! Thankfully we had enough cash on hand. Food is still good. If you don't mind this kind of environment or ambiance, then you'll be ok.",0
"This place has depreciated since my last visit. I went in with an old friend living in New York with high hopes of impressing her, but the service was unresponsive and the cold noodles I was so enamored with came out soggy and bland. 

Guess this place got in over their heads with the high volumes of customers that its quality tanked. 
 
i'll just have to find a new spot next time i visit Chinatown in NY.",0
"Listen up people, all 1700+ of you that reviewed this place:
Joe did not invent the soup dumpling and no matter what else you order it comes drenched in the same lame sauce. Go somewhere else and get back the 40 minutes you wasted in line here.  

Just around the corner at Great NY Noodletown you can get soup dumplings and items where there is some distinction in flavor. 

I don't know how things like this happen. One place gets on some tourist list and then, boom! I'm just happy that every tourist goes here and I not to my secret spots down the street that have great food.  But if you feel like getting on with your life, get out line and go down the street.",0
"This place is always so busy and I feel like a chicken without a head. However, the soup dumplings are to die for. We did order a few other meat dishes which left me feeling quite thirsty. Although the atmosphere makes me want to run out, the soup dumplings bring me to a state of bliss that everything just doesn't matter anymore.",0
"Joe's is old tired and indifferent. This is a place not to go to. The plates are thrown down on the table, one tiny plastic container of sauce for the dumplings. The dumplings were old, cold and tasteless. The staff is indifferent and we could to get out.",0
"One of my sons wrote a Video Blog about this place, so it was high on my list of places to visit during my annual stop over in the NYC / NJ area. One of the days, 3 of us stopped by  for a late lunch (still it was a 15 minutes wait). The room was full,  it was mainly tourists and the seating's are 6 per table. I wanted to try soup dumplings - my son was talking about.

We ordered an order of crab meat with pork meat soup dumplings (8 is the count) and another order of just pork meat dumplings (8 is the count). Personally, I was not impressed, some how the dough was not cooked properly, my feelings is that the kitchen was  rushing the orders out.

My son also admitted that his first stop here was much different (talking about quality of the dumplings). Is it just a bad day for a cook, maybe?  In any case, the bills are paid in cash only, gratuity is already included and I don't plan to come back here any time soon. One thing is - this place located in the China town on the block with the most ready for Instagram pictures.",0
"The only reason i come here is because it's famous enough for my non-ny friends to try. There are way better chinese restaurants all over the city. Joe's shanghai, especially the downtown one, is way too crowded, rushed, and basically no service. you wait awhile to inhale your food and get pushed out. if that's the kind of place you want to eat, go for it. the food is too mediocre to be famous.",0
"Got chicken fried rice to-go. Not bad, needs soy sauce but wasn't given any. Beware, this business is cash only and they didn't tell us that when we placed the order. Ended up having to Venmo the guy working.",0
"One of the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. The server was really rude. In the middle of taking our order, he stopped us to seat someone. Had to wait for a couple minutes before he finally came back. He tried for us to get something else on the menu that we did not want and was a much higher price than what we wanted to get. He slammed our food down right in front of us without a care and never came back to ask us if we needed anything else or more water. The guy that handed out change back from our payment stood around behind us probably to see how much tip we were giving. 

The food wasn't all the great. We just had dumplings and general tso. The general tso was overly cooked. The food was overpriced and poor quality. 

Would not recommend.",0
"Seemed like a tourist trap. No locals, high prices (for chinatown), somewhat rushy service to free up space for the next guests.",0
"What's all the rave about this place?? I don't get it. The dumplings spill out with some swine fluid like concoction an the other Chinese dishes are mediocre at best.  Everythig super greasy. Of course often that's the best part o Chinese but I had grease that didn't feel like was going straight to the arteries. Perhaps heat?

Anyhow. It did the job but with so many great places in Chinatown, why stop here? Shouldn't the masses of white people tell you to go elsewhere?",0
"Wow, not exaggerating but seriously the worst soup dumpling I've ever had. My husband and I decided to give this place a try on a Saturday night, upon recommendations of a few of our friends. When we checked in, the hostess handed us a ticket with a number, letting us know that it would be a 30 minutes wait. But that turned into almost an hour and a half wait. We ordered both crab and pork, and pork soup dumplings. Honestly, I can deal with the wait usually if the food is really good. But it was inedible. The skin of the dumpling was thin, but it lacked elasticity, and once we picked it up with the tongs, it ripped immediately. The soup inside the dumpling had a starchy aftertaste, which was very unpleasant. If this is the best soup dumpling in New York, that's pretty pathetic. It's definitely a tourist trap, will never recommend this place to anyone.",0
"I know, I know you all LOVE this place... you all ohhh and ahhh when you think of it and your mouths water and your eyes get big as they bring the dumplings towards your table. 

Well, unfortunately when I ate here I got food poisoning!! I did not even want to look at, smell or hear about Chinese food for years! Now, luckily that has passed... but I still cannot go back to Joe's. Sorry!",0
Too greasy and too salty. The dumplings Joe's is known for are way over hyped. Save yourself the wait and trek and just hop into any other chinatown eatery for better treats.,0
"100% a tourist trap. 

These are not authentic soup dumplings. My family are natives from Shanghai, and I've eaten xiaolongbao my entire life in and around Shanghai, and I can tell you as a matter of fact that these soup dumplings taste worse than what you can buy from any Chinese grocery store. If you want better tasting soup dumplings, I suggest you buy a packet of frozen soup dumplings around the corner. I guarantee you they will taste 10X better than this place and will save you both money and time.

First of all, the dumplings' skin is all wrong. The wrapper is the thickness of regular gaozi dumpling wrappers rather than the thin wrappers on authentic soup dumplings. There was a lot of juice, but it was flavorless. You can't just substitute excess pork fat for flavoring. The dumplings are also really big which ruins the definition of a soup dumpling. They are supposed to be bite sized, and people are not supposed to use spoons to eat them. Not sure where that concept came from, but in Shanghai, the proper way to eat them is dip them in black vinegar and pop them in your mouth. None of this nonsense of cutting holes and sucking out the soup and using an actual soup spoon. Doing it all wrong. The scallion pancakes were also greasy and tasteless. There were a lot of tourists who don't know what the hell real Shanghainese food is supposed to taste like so they have nothing to compare it to.",0
"Honestly I would give it zero stars if I could. We traveled out of our way to go to this restaurant based on all the rave reviews.

Service: The service was horrendous. As soon as we walked in we were rushed to a table and the seating style is where you are seated with other patrons which is totally fine. As we were looking through the menu the waiter came by and was rushing us to order. we told him we were not ready. I asked a question about an item on the menu and again he rushed me to order. He explained that the vegetable stirfry was a mixture of vegetables but he did this in a way where he was yelling the items. 

Food: The food was abysmal. When the veggie stirfry came out all it was was very very greasy pile of spinach and nothing else. It was not at all how he described in his yelling description. When I explained the waiter that the veggie stirfry was not like he described he told us too bad and he would not take it back. The soup dumplings were nothing to write home about at all.  They were mushy and did not taste good. I saw the other people seated at our table not finish their food either.

I would absolutely not recommend this place because the service and the food are very much below Chinese food standards. It was a waste of money and afterwards we were still hungry and had to go to another restaurant to eat lunch.",0
"Actually went here by mistake, meaning to go to Shanghai Cuisine where I've had nice experiences a while ago.The soup dumplings were excellent but that was about it. An Orange Beef main course was in a strange batter with way too much egg in it. My friend's string bean dish was over-cooked. The piece de resistance was the waiter cleaning the table with tea that they poured from the pot and with a rag that looked a little too well-used. The seating was cramped and in a plain room with a bunch of tables thrown in. We did wait in line to get in so apparently people like this place, particularly many who are native to this cuisine.",0
"The soup dumplings were excellent.  Everything else was good, but not great. I thought it would be weird sharing a table with strangers, but it  actually didn't matter at all.  Bring some cash because they don't take card. .",0
"My best friend and I wanted to try this place because our friends suggested if we come to NY. As we walked in, we noticed that this was a CASH ONLY restaurant. Luckily I had $20 on me. Then we were seated on a same round table as other customers. i guess due to the crowd, this will eliminate the wait time, but I wished we were notified ahead of time because it was shocking. 
Food was good. We were expecting better because of all the recommendations. We ordered the Crab&Pork Buns and the Pork Buns.  We liked the Pork Buns a lot better. It did not take long for them to bring that out, but we wanted to order the dumplings that were in the soup and the waiter said ""it will take 25 minutes.""  Sheesh, do they need to go to China to pick it up or something? The portions we ordered were good enough for two girls. 
Food was good, but we will not be coming back because I'm sure there are better alternatives.",0
"Stopped in to try the famous crab/pork xiaolongbao (steamed Shanghai soup dumplings). While they were good, some of our dumplings were stuck together and the precious soup leaked out. 

This location is authentic Chinatown, but a bit off the beaten path. I'm not a fan of the communal tables, so if you're going bring a big group and show up together. I agree with other posters that this can be a stressful dining experience for the uninitiated. You can't be afraid to flag down a waiter, or else you'll be overlooked.",0
"Super Long wait.... There was 6 of us and we waited for 50 minutes for our table. By the time we finally got inside. Our table was shared by two other party.... Normally restaurant would let you know in advance that you might be sharing a table with other party. But not this one. 
As soon as you sit down, they keep asking you how many juicy pork bun even before you read the menu... 
Since I'm from FL... Can I take a look of the menu first???
Next time I might try the one on 56 St or the one in Flushing... Hopefully their service will be better.

Tips: Cash Only",0
"Joe's Shanghai... give me a break.  Who the heck is Joe and why an American name?  I passed by this place several times just because of the name until one day someone forced me to go by gunpoint -- just joking.  I just wanted to check this place out because of all the hype.  

Was I disappointed?  The entree was aiiight.  But the soup dumplings were D-Licious.  I would come back just for the dumplings and I would get the entrees elsewhere.   

Once the last piece of food was gone, the check arrived  magically.  The waiter wanted us out because a line was forming.  What made my experience horrible was the fact that I was sitting across from a family who kept on yapping about rubbish to his daughter.  Can an Asian man enjoy his dinner with friends here... apparently not! 

Three stars Joe.  Here's a tip, you might want to add more tables!",0
"This place is a total TOURIST TRAP... The food is average and the service is lacking. They automatically charge a 15% gratuity, no matter how many are in your party. They obviously don't work for it, and it is reflected in the service you get. I walked out of there missing my Din Tai Fung.",0
"Joe's Shanghai has always been one of my favorite soup dumpling places. My husband and I has been going there for years. However, we witnessed the MOST HORRIBLE WAY they treat their customer from the most recently visit, 

My hubby and I were sitted at a round table shared with other ppl. There are 3 guys sitting next to us and it is obvious that they had never been to this restaurant before and don't know what to order. After they ordered their food, they were served an order of ""scallion pancake"". All of them looked really confused when it arrived as they have no idea what it is and also they don't really know if they had ordered it by accident. (You can really tell because we were sitting next to them and heard everything....not that I like to ear-drop)

They waited for a while and none of the waiters said anything so they decided to start eating the pancakes........And the moment when they put the pancakes onto their own plate, the waiter who took their order came running, literally pointing his finger on their face yelling -----""DID YOU ORDER THIS?"" "" YOU DIDN'T ORDER THIS RIGHT?"" ""UGH"" ""WHY ARE YOU EATING THIS. YOU DIDN'T ORDER THIS!!!""

The 3 guys looked so embarrassed and doesn't know what to do. ...... And you think that is all??? NO! He then grabbed another plate.. demanded them to put the pancakes ,which were on their own plates already, back to the plate and took it back to the kitchen!!!???

What? Really?? this is just unbelievable. Everyone is staring at them and honestly, they had no clue what that was!!!

The food there is great. If you can endure the horrible attitude, I guess it's worth a try. You might not get yelled at if you are lucky.",0
"First experience eating Shanghai Dumplings!  Liked it, but don't understand the hype around the dumplings. Ordered ones with pork and others with crabs. The thing is that they are regular dumplings, but with soup inside! And soup is freaking hot lol! Burned my tongue! They should warn people like ""caution hot"" or something lol! Dangerous!Dumplings were OK! But whatever at the same time haha. The place itself is weird, cash only. Really!? Had to go to the ATM. Also we had to share a table with some weird people. Chinese beer tastes like ass, no offense lol. The most amazing thing about this place that they have tons of pictures of owner with celebrities eating his dumplings. Service sucked big time. My second time eating Chinese this week and from now one I don't have high expectations ...",0
"I came here just for their soup dumpling and was truly disappointed! the broth of the soup is GOOD but the skin that wrap the meat is way too thick.. the service is far beyond good 
I might give another try next time when i go to NYC and we'll see what happen then.",0
"Alright guys, let's break a lot of the ""NYC = best Chinese food in the USA"" groupthink that has plagued the minds of non-native NYers for as long as I can remember. There's some partial truth to that statement, but Joe's Shanghai trips and falls really REALLY short of expectations. Like, it probably can't even see the goal line from where it's fallen. Are the expectations high? Absolutely. But that doesn't forgive the piss-poor attitude, service, and lower standard of food than the rest of its competitors.

SERVICE: The servers here are rude, but in that subtle, passive-aggressive way that many Asian restaurants are guilty of. They made us feel like intruders, despite the fact that I AM Chinese. JUST LIKE YOU. They still delivered their services as expected, but did so completely void of hospitality and friendliness. Since the only way to get a server over at a Chinese restaurant is to make eye contact and the servers REFUSE to make any sort of eye contact with you, you'll be stuck waiting about 10-15 minutes just to get a refill on water.  So ration and plan accordingly.

FOOD: The only...and I mean, ONLY...saving grace of this restaurant is their dumplings--AKA xiao long bao. I've had better at higher-end restaurants (Din Tai Fung in Seattle/LA) and better at random restaurants (Szechuan Garden in AZ), but Joe's Shanghai does it pretty damn well. The bao's are loaded with soup broth though, so be careful! You may end up spilling some of that on yourself, as I did. MULTIPLE TIMES.

We also got their Pan Fried Crispy Noodles. It's not what you'd expect. If you're expecting Hong Kong Style Chow Mein, look elsewhere. The noodles are thicker, flatter in taste, and a hell of a lot less savory. Avoid this dish unless you know what you're getting.

Honestly, I can't remember what else we got. I was so frustrated I didn't even bother taking pictures. It was something simple like beef and broccoli. It was meh, I know plenty of people who could make it better--myself included.

Some may write off this review as being overly harsh, but you have to. It's NYC. If you aren't up to par, then the next restaurant will be. There are tons of framed images of the restaurant owner(s) with famous celebrities, but don't let that fool you. I'd look elsewhere regardless of the circumstance.",0
"If I really wanted to consider the service here, I would have given them a lower rating but the dumplings are so good I let them slide on this one.  Anyone with any expectation of real customer service from any Asian restaurant in NY or any large city for that matter is delusional.  So just get over it and get used to it.  Eat the food and keep your whining to yourself.  Of course I wish this wasn't the case for the majority of the restaurants but it's reality so moving on to the food...

The dumplings are a hundred times better than anything I can get here in Dallas, I know I know, it's freaking Texas, but perhaps my standards have been lowered by years of consuming sub par Asian food at the hands of Americanized Asians forced to alter their menus to appease the timid and bland taste buds of those so called adventurous eaters here down south.  

We ordered the soup dumplings and a side of stir fried snow pea leaves both were excellent and left me feeling quite proud of myself as I can still manage to identify good Asian food.  The filling in the dumpling was delicious, I could sit there for hours and eat one after another.  That would not be a bad idea if it were not for the other strangers sitting at your table gazing at you while you dine.  If you can look past the long lines, the rude and impatient wait staff then expect to find some good eats in what are their famous soup dumplings.",0
"over rated tbh.
full of tourists and long lines...why wait here for something that is way hyped up?
Try other local small businesses where they serve up better soup dumplings.
Its hard to eat there since staff rushes you to eat and get out for the next group of people.",0
"I had an order of crab meat XLB ($8.25 for 8), which looked like pork XLBs ($6.25 for 8). They skimped on the crab and mixed in powdered crustacean shell to enhance the flavor. 

I had to ask if I were having the crab meat XLB and the staff said yes, with a peculiar look. 

For ""the XLB experience"" in general, go for pork XLBs instead - for $2 less. Just as flavorful and give you room for dessert (egg custards at an area bakery). Ask for extra sauce cups to catch the soup, as you delve into an XLB.

Look carefully at the receipt - 15% service charge is already there.

If you are into more ""crab meat"" and not mostly pork in your crab meat XLBs, go to Nan Xiang XLB in Queens. If they are still making XLBs like they did two years ago, it's worth the trip.",0
"Have you ever heard that saying: ""Americans created Chinese food"" well that is EXACTLY what came to mind after eating at this establishment.

I'm part Chinese so of course I've had a lot of authentic Chinese food and have pretty high expectations but unfortunately Joe's Shanghai did not meet those expectations.

First of all, this restaurant has a B rating. Um...ew, why? I'm a nutrition/environmental science major and that just screams NOO to me right off the bat. So as soon as I saw that rating I already began to hold on to my fucking hat. 

I was so disappointed upon our food arriving to our table and was a little perplexed as to why this establishment has 4 stars from so many reviews. Perhaps my party and I just ordered the wrong dishes? 

The service was pretty average for a Chinese restaurant (meaning it was not that great & actually pretty forgettable) & there was a 45 minute wait but luckily we only waited 20 minutes. When we walked in we noticed the restaurant was PACKED. So crowded that they were even seating different parties at the same tables (sorry I'm from LA so that's not new nor is the hustle & bustle of a first world metropolitan to me but I found that even a little more annoying as I wasn't mentally prepared to share a conversation let alone let other people eavesdrop on mine lol) which is not cool in my book. Again, fortunately we were seated off to the side of the place at a table big enough for my party. We ordered immediately (having gone to these types of establishments many times before we already knew what cravings we wanted to satisfy) and the food came to us soon enough after. 
Boy were we disappointed..the seafood pan friend noodle dish was not what we had anticipated. The noodles they used were much different than the usual noodles that are usually used for that dish which made me feel like I had been eating the Viet styled pan fried noodle. Next, the spicy squid with salt (not sure that's what it reads on the menu) was not prepared to our liking..maybe that was our fault for not specifying? Lastly we also ordered the shrimp and noodle soup & when that arrived it honestly just looked & tasted like it was prepared by a man named Joe from Arkansas lol. It was NOT Chinese. Idk I guess we're just picky? The food was just so lackluster. 

Anyway, I'm glad this business is doing well but WE will definitely not be returning to this restaurant!",0
"One of my stops during my NYC trip. Everyone raves about Joe's Shanghai so I had to give it a try. It's so busy here you have to share tables and it's cash only! As soon as you sit down they ask if you want to order dumplings. Well, i guess if you push one product I can see how you'd become known for it. Honestly, it was tasty but no different than the ones I've had here in San Francisco. I guess then it would make it average. I also ordered the shanghai noodles, also no different than SF. Sad to say, it wasn't a let down but probably not worth a stop when I visit NYC since I can get the equivalent back home, without having to share tables.",0
"The low-down on Joes is that it's always packed. And the decor is awful. And most of the dishes are nothing to write home about.  And given the competition nearby, the prices aren't fantastic. 

BUT, then you taste the soup dumplings, and all is forgiven. They are heavenly. It's a strange process, chomping the top and drinking the soup; it feels so wrong, but tastes so right.

Go for the dumplings and stay for a second order.",0
"do not recommend if your table is bigger than 4

They have a terrible system and will give any available seats away until there are less people.

They also have shady under-dealings. You need to pay them under the table cash to get a seat for big tables, if you do you can skip the line.

Cash only!!!",0
"I was looking for a nice dimsum place where they go around with the carts and when I searched under dimsum, this place came up. That's the down side to yelp, it's not very specific. This place does not have dimsum. Onto the food: we had the shanghai soup dumplings, which were surprisingly delicious. The fried pork dumplings were ok, kind of peppery and inconsistently cooked. The scallion pancake tasted ok, but was too greasy. The beef and broccoli and mushoo pork were both good, but nothing special; I'm sure you could find them much cheaper and equally good elsewhere in Chinatown. I was surprised this place got so much hype.",0
"It was ok. It is a bit overrated. The soup dumplings were alright, but I probably wouldn't eat here again to be honest. We also had the shanghai fried flat noodles; they were decent, not a ton of flavor. All in all.... I won't be back when there are so many other good places to eat in NYC.",0
A super popular spot for good reason. But also a bit of a tourist trap.  There are better places to get Chinese food in nyc but joes shanghai also has a deservedly decent reputation.  If you don't want to dig deeper it's a decent choice.,0
"Took my niece here, who is like a soup dumpling maven, and she wasn't wowed.  Neither was I.  While tasty, the pork dumplings seemed a bit flat with not that much soup in them.  We really enjoyed the shrimp and chicken in plum sauce, and I liked the cold noodles - my niece not so much.  The communal dinning doesn't bother me at all - I like to be a little nosy and see what every one is ordering.  Given the wait time to get in, along with not being wowed by the dumplings, not rushing back.  Also not the biggest fan of the cash only policy.",0
"Special trip from Midtown to Chinatown just for the infamous Joe's Shanghai's soup dumplings (XLB) was absolutely worthless. I was very disappointed and unhappy after trying their XLB. People who gave 4 or 5 stars to Joe's Shanghai's XLB really haven't tried good XLB, literally.

The wait time for us was 30 mins. Once we got seated and ordered, we were so excited and ready to try their famed XLB and expected it to be good. We were totally wrong. The skin of XLB was too thick - the filling was juicy but tasteless. The XLBs here are way overrated! My mom makes better XLB than JoeSchmoe, seriously.

The XLB at Joe's Shanghai is ONLY ordinary and acceptable, definitely not worth the wait!",0
"We had to make a stop here for the famous soup dumplings. I ordered carry out because of the large crowd, but when I went to pick it up just a couple inured early, they were quite rude and wouldn't give me my order. We waited for a while and finally got the dumplings, but I wasn't very pleased with the service. The dumplings them self were not worth the hype, but still had a nice authentic place. I would recommend coming here for the popularity, but I'm sure you can find better soup dumplings elsewhere.",0
"Fast service but super touristy, overcrowded, and food seems catered towards a more stereotypical American palate.",0
"5 star doe soup dumplings. 1star for service.  We ordered eggplant besides the soup dumplings,  which never came.  We asked several times but the server never moved. Only after we said we would like to cancel it if the eggplant is still not ready,  the server went to check and immediately brought the eggplant.",0
Super disappointing. Flavor just wasn't there. I expected more because of the great reviews in Yelp. We didn't even finish our food.,0
"This place was packed when we arrived, but we did go on a Sunday. The wait was not too bad, but it is helpful if you can speak Chinese. The xiao long bao's or  their soup dumplings were really good, however it does not as good as some of the other ones I have had in China. I had both pork and crab dumplings; the pork dumplings tasted better but in general I felt that there was almost TOO much soup in it (but that is just me being picky). 

The soup is hot, the service is fast...know what you want before you get seated. It's communal seating so if you are not looking for a romantic meal, think twice. Good prices and good food, I would go again!",0
"Because their service (or lack thereof), I would never go back. 

I'm sure the 3500+ reviews says a lot about their soup dumplings, and I DO love their dumplings but can care less to go back because their staff (probably also their management) can care less if I go back.  After my third, and last visit, I've decided to take my business elsewhere, where tip is based on service (and NOT already included on your bill).     

Price: $-$$

Service: shameful

Groups: yes

Would I come back? No",0
"I was disappointed to order here and only accept cash . 

I don't know where is it that they just impose rules on the public .",0
"Going to a crowded spot like Joe's with just one other person (versus a group) is awesome because quick seating is almost guaranteed. 

Sat down and knew without looking at the menu what I wanted: soup dumplings. I'd had them at Shanghai Cafe but I wanted to know what they were like at Joe's. 

They were .. decent. I prefer Shanghai Cafe but it's just a personal preference; I'm sure there are plenty who like Joe's better. 

We also ordered pork fried rice cakes - I really liked this dish! 

I'll probably be back to try other things on the menu and share the soup dumplings with whatever friend(s) I might be with at that time.",0
"Decent, but doesn't live up to hype. Ordered both types of soup dumplings, and half of them came broken. Large, but flimsy. The scallion pancakes we ordered were probably the best part! Beware it's cash only.",0
Only two things were great -- the steamed dumplings (xiao long bao) and the scallion pancake. Everything else was just Ok. The interior feels a bit gloomy.,0
"Eh..... The xiaolongbao are not half as good as their reputation suggests. Really? 4 stars, Yelpers? Come on.....!

Tried both the shrimp one and the plain pork one. Super disappointed. The key to xiaolongbao is a really thin skin that can simultaneously hold the weight of the soup and pork without breaking, and also being light and chewy.  This is worse than most xiaolongbao I've eaten in my life - given, I did grow up in the land of delicious Chinese food (hong kong). Xiaolongbao skin was thick and overcooked. So if you're wanting to get authentic, great xiaolongbao, this is definitely not the place for you. (Although I'm not sure if there is a better place to go to in New York.) Their Singaporean fried noodles and homemade tofu dish is up to par, though! You know what, I might consider coming back for those dishes - but again, considering how overpriced and crowded they are (come on, its Chinatown,) I probably never will.",0
"Came back for the soup dumplings here.  Dumplings were decent, not as good as I remembered before!  

Cash only.  They charged us 15-16% gratuity fee for two people less than a party of four or five included in the bill which I thought was odd...",0
"I ordered:
- Original xiao long bao (sort of bland)
- Xiao long bao with crabmeat (best flavor)
- Scallion pancake
- Salt and pepper fried fish

Got here at 8pm and they seated us at a large round table with random people even when my friend and I asked to sit at an open 4-person table. 2 minutes after we sit down, 2 people walk in and are seated at that table we wanted. Not a huge deal though.

The xiao long bao came out very quickly and haphazardly. 1 of them was broken so all the soup came out. The presentation of the xiao long bao wasn't very appealing. They looked like they were melting. The taste was fine, but I still think Din Tai Fung (located only in Taiwan, Shanghai, and Los Angeles) has the best xiao long bao. The ones at Joe's were sloppy and huge, which would often cause them to fall off of my spoon.

Scallion pancake was quite depressing, since I barely tasted any scallion. The salt and pepper fried fish was decent, but the breading was too thick. I also found a small hair within the breading while I was eating. I didn't bring up the issue with the waiter because they looked really busy. 

The prices are fair here and I'm glad to get away from the outrageous prices I see elsewhere. 

I hear this one of the better places in NYC. I can see why, but it's so hard to say that it's the best when you've really had the best somewhere else.",0
"Not the ideal location for a tourist to locate this restaurant. It's tucked away in a alley street where they usually film gangster fight in this quaint small street. Anyway, we had 3 ppl and had to share a large table with few others. With all the excitement and recommendations from friends, I expected goood soup dumpling.

Let's put it this way, it's good and it has the taste. I wouldn't say it's the best (which i had better ones in Canada), nor was it the worst, it was average good.  Being so reputable, I expected more and didnt expect them to serve soup dumpling that is already leaking soup... that was disappointing. Maybe the restaurant doesn't care for the presentation anymore?

The scallion pancake was tasty, but way too greasy.. Just average. 

I would probably go to the location in East Village in the future, i might probably feel safer.",0
Good XLB. Long Lines / crowded.,0
"I have to say this is def. not a favorite. I've been to Joe's in flushing which is MUCH better than the Pell St location. Their dumplings tasted very different than those @ the Flushing loc. They weren't as juicy or tasteful. The dough was thick. The food itself was good but I have had better in smaller Chinatown restaurants. The wait was ridiculous. There is no waiting area so you have to stand outside and wait.  Unfortunately, the next day was garbage day and it was quite smelly of rotten garbage outside while we waited. Then you are seated with strangers @ large round tables. They cleaned the table with a dirty towel. The table was sticky. I had the pleasure of sitting next to a guy who just would not stop talking and saying the most rudest things to his girlfriend, her cousin and ate like a caveman. My hubs had the pleasure of sitting next to a guy who would cough all thru the meal and not cover his mouth. The dining room seating was so crowded that I got knocked in the head 3x by the waiters tray. The restroom.......YIKES. I've been in porter potties that I consider to be cleaner!  We thought experiencing Joe's on Pell would be a good experience but it ended up being gross and a huge tourist trap.....

Do the trip to Joe's in Flushing! It's worth it and you will have a much better experience - and awesome soup dumplings!",0
"20% of our soup dumplings had no soup. Even the with-soup dumplings did not meet the hype. Items 9 and 10 are what most people order, #9 is the eight crab dumplings for about $6.65 and #10 is eight pork dumplings for about $4.65 (prices accurate as of Apr 2011). I would say one order of eight dumplings is good enough for a small meal.

All other menu items are WAY overpriced for Chinatown and completely skippable. No interesting flavors, just salty and really oily. We tried the braised pork shoulder and the eel with yellow chives (my mom is a eel expert and complained that they used frozen eel). 

Go here only if you're craving soup dumplings. Have fun with the wait and the automatic 15% tip.",0
It's true.  I only go here for the soup dumplings.  But they are so damn good.,0
"I'm not sure why this place was so packed.  The food was so so.  We got the sticky rice, the edamame, crab soup dumplings for lunch.  The service was rushed.  They only had two waiters so I suppose that's why they were rushing people in and out.  There are so many other places to try in this area.  Provably won't be coming back.",0
"The Crab XLB was amazing.  I think it was #1 on the menu.
The other dishes were ok.....
I have to agree with many of the reviewers.  
1. It is a tourist trap. 
2. Service is mediocre 
3. The wait (1 hour and a half for us) was not worth it.  

If you have time, head over to Flushing for some better Chinese food.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is one of those places where you feel obligated to go simply because the amount of reviews it has on Yelp. It's like a right of passage to NY. As much as I hate giving it 3 stars and going against all of the highly rated reviews, I think this place is completely overrated and overhyped. The wait time usually varies between 30 minutes to 1.5 hours, and you're not allowed to sit until all of your members are there. They give you a line number system but even if one person is missing, it goes to the next group. Weekends are the worst and so is dinner time, although even during off hours I always see a massive line out the door. The interior is pretty small and is insanely packed. Basically it's a tourist trap. 

Joe's is renown for its soup dumplings. These especially hit the spot during a cold winter day, or simply after a night of shenanigans. I will say the dumplings are reasonably priced! I came with a group and we tried a couple of varieties. The xiao long bao was soft and freshly steamed. The inside soup was pretty good, but I found I needed to pour some sauces inside to really amp up the flavor. It leaned towards the sweeter side, whereas I'm more of a slightly saltier broth type of girl.

Overall the food is decent but the wait time is not worth it. There are much better places in Chinatown.",0
"I'll admit I've not had xiao long bao anywhere else, but I've had my share of different types of bao/dumplings and while it was good, it wasn't out of this world, knock me off of my socks. I guess so much hype, I expected much more. The bun part seemed to a little too chewy. We had both the pork and the crab... both were okay, though I prefer the pork to the crab.",0
"I was sadly quite disappointed with Joe's Shanghai.  After trying Nan Xiang a couple of weeks ago, someone whose food opinion I highly respect recommended this place, so I was very excited to try it, especially being that Flushing is a hike and a half away for me.

We went to Joe's on a Tuesday night.  The place was packed.  We were seated immediately at a communal table.  The service was a little spotty.  Although we personally had a pretty good experience, the people across from us would beg to differ.  Their server accidentally threw away their to-go food and then took ~10 minutes to admit it, while they were trying to leave. Awkward to watch - one of the drawbacks of the communal table situation. Part of the reason that it's annoying is that they automatically add gratuity onto the bill here.  

We ordered the crab & pork soup dumplings, the Shanghai noodles, and a side of bok choy.  

The dumplings came out first.  Even though all the flavors were there, EVERY SINGLE DUMPLING broke.  Not the best craftsmanship and made it very difficult to eat them.  

Next were the Shanghai noodles.  These were pretty standard and this was a large portion, so we were overall happy with the dish.  

Lastly, the bok choy came out.  While I love bok choy, it prompted both me and my dining partner to independently ask if bok choy was in season.  While there was nothing specifically wrong with the dish, it wasn't fantastic either.  

All in all, for $36, this was a large amount of food, but it certainly did not live up to the hype for me.",0
"*2.5 Stars* After seeing people around me slurping up broth and biting into their steamy, plump, succulent soup dumplings, I couldn't wait to get my order. I guess it just wasn't what I expected after hearing so many great things about this place. My best friend and I got the pork and crab meat dumplings. The soup was greasy and the flavor was just so odd... it didn't taste anything like pork or crab meat. It kind of tasted 'old' and 'instant.' I liked the chewy texture of the dumpling skin but I couldn't get around the flavor of the meat or the thick oily broth.

I really liked the Crispy Shredded Beef. Despite the strips of beef being mostly crunchy breading, it was sweet and fried and 10x better than the dumplings.

We went around dinner time on a work night and thankfully didn't have to wait in line. We were seated immediately at a round table with some other folks, and although the place was pretty packed we were able to order, eat, and pay fairly quickly.",0
"Food - 2 stars

I would not recommend this restaurant. I will definitely not be returning. The moment I walked in, my gut told me to walk out but the Yelp reviews reported 4 stars and so I decided to give it a chance. Staying was a mistake and a waste of stomach space.",0
"18% tip automatically added or as they call it, a service charge which is not voluntary the way tip should be.  It's still cash only.  At this new location, the soup dumplings have changed with a thicker skin, less flavorful broth, and less tender filling.  I would rather go to Shanghai Cafe Deluxe, or whatever the new name is, on Mott St.",0
Meh. Soup dumplings were alright. A bit more fatty tasting than usual. (Which is what made it worse imo) The dumplings you can get in vancouver canada are definitely better.,0
"If you and looking for American Chinese food, this is the place. A big NO if you are looking for real Chinese food",0
The dumplings are really good but the prices shot up a little since I last visited. Usually really crowded and you have to wait to get in but pretty much worth it when you have the munchies. The wait staff is a little rude and tend to rush you. I tried their place in Mid town but I didn't like it that much. It was even more expensive and the place smelled.,0
"Really good xiao long bao has thinnish skin, a little bit of soup and is savory, i have had xiao long bao all over taiwan and at Din Tai fung the world famous xiao long bao restaurant that has locations all around the world. I think the best I have had have all been at random street stalls at night.. 

Joe's Xiao long bao has thick skin, a ton of soup and is weirdly sweet... in other words damn my cousin for being right this place has a weird take on one of my favorite chinese foods. Maybe in NY its considered good but if this thick skinned soupy ass thing they dare called xiao long bao opened up in the bay area it would close up real fast.",0
"I gave this rating purely based on a possible rip-off situation committed by this restaurant.  It would be 3 without the situation I am about to warn the fellow yelpers.

I actually visited Joe's twice.  I went in there for the first time around 1:30 simply by seeing how busy the place was.  We were combined with 2 groups at a big table.  We enjoyed the lunch we had but did not recall the name of restaurant.

For my recent trip to NYC, I did some homework to google for ""best Chinese Food in NYC.""  This restaurant popped out and I yelped it for popular items fellow yelpers mention.  We went there before lunch rush hour and realized it is the same one we went to several months ago.  We were so glad that we made the right choice at that time.  We ordered two kinds of soup dumplings.  My wife and I have different opinions.  She thinks our San Francisco favorite is better but I think it is as good as yelpers recommend.  We tipped by our regular percentage on the receipt.

A few days after we got back to CA, my wife found the receipt while cleaning up all the receipts in her handbag.  She was so upset to find that Joe's actually charged 15% in their subtotal.  Normally we briefly check the restaurant receipts, but we just missed it.  I am sure there is a fine print to state that service charge would be levied for any number of guests on the menu.  We were burned by a dim-sum restaurant in Chinatown Oakland for years before we learned that it charges 10%.  We manage to warn our friends for this unusual practice to collect tips.  Therefore, when you visit this restaurant, don't be distracted by all the waiters standing around your table.  READ THE FINE PRINT, IF ANY, ON THE MENU, AND IT IS 15% IN YOUR RECEIPT ALREADY.",0
"One star for the soup dumplings. They were ok. Definitely NOT spectacular, and definitely NOT worth the wait. 
Zero stars for everything else. 
Because of its popularity, you have to wait a while to get seated, and you have to wait outside. 
The restaurant itself is loud and kind of dirty. Not dirty in the way a ""hole in the wall"" place is dirty, because that's fine. This place was truly dirty.
Every table is a communal table, so unless you're a party of 10 that can take up an entire table, you're eating on a table with strangers. 
Several people on my table didn't realize it was cash only when time to pay, so clearly the restaurant should make that more clear. 
There is also an included gratuity of 15%. Included gratuity?!?! For what?!?! Half decent food, horrible ambiance, and a staff that just tries to rush you out of there so they can keep the wait line moving?
Perhaps this place was good at one point. Unfortunately, it's become a victim of its popularity. An increase in customers leads to increased pressure on the staff and the cooks. The staff just tries to rush you out. On my way out, none of the staff said thank you for coming. I've lived in NYC all my life. I know that most Chinese restaurants rush you and do not provide warm, attentive service. But even they say ""thank you for coming."" Not this place. This place was beyond rude. They just ignore you and they're probably happy you left so that they can keep the line moving. The increased popularity hurts the food quality as well, since cooks can't deliver the same quality of food because they're rushed. This then leads to customers, like myself, who, after waiting to get seated amongst strangers, eating ""just ok"" food, and being rushed out by staff, you actually regret spending money here.",0
"I just moved to NY and was really excited to check out chinatown especially since I was living in Chicago for 6 years where the chinatown was almost nonexistent. I saw all the reviews of this place so I thought it would be a great meal. This place was really disappointing. I didn't like the communal seating method they used but more importantly, the food was mediocre at best. They seemed to emphasis rushing you in and out versus actually delivering on good food.",0
"If you're looking for traditional soup dumplings, this probably isn't the spot for you. I had heard about Joe's Shanghai from many different spots that recommended NYC eats, so I figured I would give them a try. There was quite a lot of people waiting, but we got our number called in around 20 minutes. However, from there they still made us wait another 20 minutes or so which felt weird.

We decided to only get soup dumplings since that is what they're known for, and got an order of the pork and another of the crab and pork. They arrived pretty quickly, and we were all quite shocked when they opened the steamer basket because of how large they were. These are probably around double the size of your normal xiaolongbao, so a single order of 8 is actually quite a lot. The skin was also a lot thicker than normal, which my friends and I didn't really prefer. There was definitely plenty of soup inside, but the soup had some weird gelatinous bits within which was odd to eat. Between the two, we felt the classic pork was better but the crab wasn't too bad either. 

I don't think I'd return, but at least I got to try for myself the soup dumplings that people always talk about from here. Not traditional, but acceptable.",0
"Disappointed with our experience at Joe's Shanghai.  We came here based on the reviews on yelp, and expected more.  When we arrived, there was a long line of people waiting outside so we assumed the place must be great!  The wait time quoted was 30 minutes, however it took about 50 minutes to be seated and that is only because two parties ahead of us left.  

The establishment is small and dark.  The wall next to our table was splattered with food, and during our meal a roach crawled out from behind one of the pictures and walked across the wall above our table.  GROSS!!  So much to say about the wait staff.  For starters, my husband accidentally walked in on one of them using the single-use restroom, and the man finished urinating, did NOT wash his hands, and then served food to a nearby table.  Totally unsanitary!  Also, they bring the food out one order at a time, so you are not eating your meal together.  The last dish was brought to the table 25 minutes after the first dish, so 2 of the people were finished eating before the other 2 even started!  Lastly, they are very unattentive - you have to ask for absolutely everything mutliple times (water, tea, napkin).  The restaurant automatically includes 15% tip and NY sales tax in your bill, so since the wait staff is guaranteed a 15% tip, there is no incentive for them to be attentive.  Also, be sure you bring cash!  There is no payment via credit or debit cards, cash only.

As for the food, the wontons and fried rice were outstanding!  They deserve 5 stars!!  The other food is nothing special.  Typical Chinese food you would get anywhere.",0
"I would give a negative star if I could. We didn't even get a chance to eat here because the check in process was horrible... they told us the wait was  45 min and that was okay , however 15 min later they told us the wait was over an hour.... apparently they honor people who leave and come back even though they were called... this is unfair to those who wait... in that case why not make reservations.  The other downside was cash only.",0
"Jury Duty for 4 months,  a dumpling is necessary. I heard this place was legendary.  We went there 3 times and only once did i taste a dumpling. I probably shouldn't have waited. It was pretty tasty. I'll venture back downtown, sans jury summons.

CASH ONLY",0
"I've become a fan Xiao Long Baos, but the rest of the food is just ok.",0
"The waiting line is long. They shouldn't let strangers sit at the table together. Uncomfortable to eat with anybody that you don't know. Not good service, the waitresses doesn't know how to do service, not friendly just stay in the front desk to clean the menu.",0
It is so famous in Yelp so we walked inside. We ordered four dishes. The pork soup dumpling is not bad but others are so so.Since the gratuity is counted into the total payment automatically，the staffs in this restaurant are not nice. They are impatient when we are ordering（we alrealy know what to order）and being rude while cleaning the table（one guy accidently hit me by tray）.,0
Good place for Shanghi food.,0
"I had the dumplings everyone goes crazy over. They were tasty but otherwise this was just a busy Chinese food place - no dim sum, which was what I was searching for.",0
"restaurant is to scam tourists - oily salty over priced food
poor service 
also be careful: cash only 
illegally silently charges 18 percent to your check",0
Yelp rarely leads me to a place I don't like! Sorry but  this place was way too greasy and not what I was expecting the shezuan chicken was drowning in grease and oil. They start you off with dumplings which were really good. My husband had the pork fried rice and we also thought it was way too greasy there's a line and a long wait and honestly it wasn't worth it to me.,0
"This place has great prices and the food is above average. I did try the famous ""soup balls"" and was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful they were. The downside is that there is no private dinning whatsoever, you will sit with strangers guaranteed. And you will wait a minimum of 20 minutes until a rude hostess calls your number, because well... That's what you are at a place like this... A number.",0
"During our trip to NYC, Joe's showed up repeatedly on our search for must-have restaurants.  Needless to say we made a point to make a trip to see what the hype was all about. 

Totally overrated, totally overhyped, and total disappointment. 

To start, the popular soup dumplings.  I don't think I've ever been so repulsed by a food item.  I've had soup dumplings before, and these were absolutely horrible.  Soup was bland.  Also, there was so much fat in the soup.  It looked disgusting and I couldn't eat them.  The amount of fat floating in the soup was repulsive. I cannot even begin to describe how bad it was.  It kind of set the tone for the rest of the visit as I was scared to try anything else. 

I ordered the Shanghai fried rice. The pics I saw showed a tastier looking version.  When we got ours, it was a very bland dish.  It was just white rice with eggs and onions in it. No sauce, no flavors.  Disappointed again. 

Then we had the crispy noodles with beef. Another popular item.  The crispy noodles were ok.  The beef wasn't horrible but something about the sauce was very off.  

Overall, I can't recommend this place.   Don't do it.",0
Their soup dumplings are amazing . However they had a C rating last time i went. My understanding of C means roaches rodents and food left out in improper temperatures. If they would just keep their place clean then maybe the food will be trust worthy enough to enjoy. I do like their pan fried noodles . But i will not go bAck until that letter is A,0
"So, Joe's had a tough task in trying to impress, given I'd had my heart set on feasting at Shanghai Cuisine (which is, most regrettably, closed on Tuesdays).

Overall, a bit overpriced, I think, for the greasiness of the food. Shanghai's dumplings are more delicate and less oily-tasting. I'm also dropping my review a star for general ambiance and service; everything except getting the bill took eons.

For the SF-familiar: My dinner partner points out that the pork soup dumplings, drained of the soup, taste quite a bit like those of U-Lee on Hyde Street. Worth mentioning, not worth venturing out for.",0
"I like Joe's Shanghai.. but what is up with the waiter?

I felt like the waiter was trying to rush us out? I know it was around closing time, but there were still 2 LARGE tables sitting there and EATING. Cleaning up a table with 3 people is not gonna make you go home that much earlier. We had one soup dumpling left and the waiter stood next to us with his hand on the chair waiting for us to eat it so he can take the steamer away. Then when we got the oranges, I didn't even get a chance to eat it yet and he comes up to us, grabs the plate, and says, you don't want it anymore, right? I immediately told him, yes, i want it.",0
"I came because my friend recommended this place to me. I was hoping for a great experience, but I left feeling a bit disappointed. Service was horrible, our server was rude and didn't help us with anything. It was also strange to be seated with other parties too instead of having our own table even though there were open tables around us. 

SHRIMP FRIED RICE
The flavor was so simple and basic. It definitely wasn't worth the price. There was way too much soy sauce in the rice and it was very salty. It definitely was lacking the authentic fried rice I was looking for. 

SAUTEED STRING BEAN- with minced pork
This was one of the better dishes. I really liked the crispness. It definitely added some textures to some of the other dishes. 

CRISPY PEPPER SKIN DUCKLING
I really disliked this dish. The skin was crisp, but salty. I didn't like the flavor and it was just too fried for my liking. The flavor didn't stand out in anyway other than the salt. It was very disappointing. 

CRAB MEAT WITH PORK MEAT SOUP DUMPLINGS
If I ate this dish alone, I would give this restaurant 5 stars. The dumplings were my favorite part of the meal. It was so sweet and moist. I really like the sweet broth inside the dumplings. I've tried other places that have tried this, but have failed. If I ever come back, it will only be to order this and this alone.

I most likely won't be coming back. The service and food are disappointing. I did like their staple soup dumpling dish, but I don't know if it's worth the whole experience.",0
Rude and angry service on the phone. Placed an order and was told the total of the order. The amount seemed high based on website prices. So I enquired. Apparently they raised the prices but didn't update the website.  That is fine but there was no need to yell at me. The woman was so upset that I asked. She screamed that they will change it. The exchange was so unpleasant and should  have been handled with grace. This is a restaurant not a street fight. Do better!,0
"My friend, who lives in New York, recommended this restaurant when I asked her good chinese restaurants.

I've been here a few times so far. My husband and I went to New York for the weekend and came here for lunch for the first time.
We arrived here around 11:30am and were seated immediately. People kept coming in, so I was excited for the food.
We ordered shrimp fried rice, xiao long bao,  and sesame chicken. Yep, we ordered so much food! I liked their xiao long bao a lot. Sesame chicken and shrimp fried rice were good too. 

I really liked their food, so we decided to come back here for lunch recently. We arrived here around 12:00pm and had to share the one big round table with two other 2-people groups.

We ordered xiao long bao, chicken fried rice, and dumplings this time. I was very disappointed that xiao long bao wasn't as good as the first time. Fried rice and dumplings were good though. Since all groups ordered so much food, we had to make room for the food.

The service was okay. It's a typical chinese restaurant. Nothing spectacular. The portions are large, and the prices are okay. 

I wouldn't come back voluntary but I may come back if my friends wants to come here.",0
"Been coming here since I was a child and I have to say it's not what it used to be. The food have flavor all because of MSG, so it doesn't have the pure flavor on its own. And compare to other shanghainese restaurants, this is over priced, the food isn't what it used to be and it's not worth the wait. Overall, disappointing.",0
"The food was ok. The atmosphere was terrible. There is usually a long wait to get in and when you do music is blaring, you sit down and the waiters are in you instantly asking you if your ready. They all seem very angry and they don't really care if they get your order right. Once we were done eating we were getting our money out and four waiters were circling around the table watching us. The food was not worth the wait nor the aggressive and unfriendly staff.",0
"Like everyone said the soup dumplings here rule. But warning to the unaware... if you come here with a small group 1 to 4 people and its busy, then they will make you share tables. This place is small and tends to get crowded. So be prepared for the culture shock. For those of you use to this, it is just like Chinatown dimsum.

In addition to the soup dumplings, the next extraordinary item on the menu is the Shanghai Noodles. Order it, Eat it, and Savor it. Its a must order item. Everything else on the menu is good, as are the seasonal specials. But the noodles are the second best thing at this restaurant.

This is the best Joe's Shanghai location. The one in flushing sucks. I've eaten there 3 times and each time its proved incredibly disappointing. Its like the one in flushing is a franchise restaurant runned by white people or something. The food is just off. The one uptown is okay... good food, better service, but its a rip off. Down in Chinatown you can get 8 Xiao Lung Bao (soup dumpling) for $6. Up there its like 5 for $8. The pricing like that across the menu... 20%-30% more... just go down to Chinatown. You can get dessert at the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory after dinner.",0
"We came first, then another group of people came in and the waitress ask us to share the round table. We didn't want to seat with a group of strangers, so we asked to seat just our group. Then the waitress spoke in Chinese with others and just asked another group to share the table. There was No ""excuse me"", No ""sorry"". What kind of customer service was that? 
I didn't try the food yet, but with the way they treat customers like that, I don't think we gonna enjoy the food and services",0
Sitting here thinking we went for dim sum. No dim sum.  And food is just ok.  Dirty glasses.  Very touristy.  There is much better just next store.,0
"The soup dumplings are the worst I've had as a frequent visitor to Dim Tai Fong. It's clearly reheated vs freshly cooked. Everything else is poorly cooked too. I ordered a fish dish and the whole body is missing - how do I eat a fish head and tail?!

The ambience is just terrible, very loud and everything is greasy. If you are visiting NYC and Chinatown for the heck of it, please steer clear from this restaurant. Rest assured their waiters were not expecting you  to return the moment you walked in :)",0
"NO. Just no. Am Chinese, visiting from California. Go to the west coast if you want good Chinese food. Like LA, or SF, or Vancouver (LA is #1. Speaking as someone who hates on LA lol). This place is not it; I feel bad for people who come here because of the reviews (like me).

The soup dumplings were huge and therefore awkward to eat. Too thick and starchy. The actual pork dumpling filling was fine. But the crab dumpling was so fishy and off-putting (this is coming from someone who doesn't mind fishy. Like fish sauce & shrimp paste fishy). Crab meat was the orangey fishy kind you buy from the can. Potent stuff.

THEN we ordered Sichuan beef. (Now I understand you don't come to NYC for Sichuan food. I just wanted to try it, since it was listed on the ""favorites"" menu). There was nothing Sichuan about it, no numbing, nothing. Needed seasoning (even just salt!). Barely spicy. Bad cut of beef, chewy. I sort of had to wrestle with it with my teeth and chopsticks. That very oily, starchy, almost gravy-like sauce that they do for Americanized Chinese food. Like they put cornstarch. When people stereotype and say 'Chinese food is too oily?' Yes, this was that, in a bad way.

Oh and FYI it's cash only with 18% service charge. The service was good, attentive.

Bottom line: If you want authentic food of different ethnic cultures... Follow the historical immigration trends. It's really that simple. For example, I'd come to NYC to try European/western cuisine. Or SoCAL if you want good Mexican food. The majority of Asians came through the Pacific. If you want good Asian food, you're better off looking on the west coast.

PS: This review may be a bit harsh, but I'm just trying to help people out.",0
"I came here because of all of the hype behind this place, but I don't think it is worth it. We got the crab soup dumplings and the pork soup dumplings. Unfortunately, the soup dumplings lack a lot of flavor and they were a lukewarm when they were brought out. I had to smother them in vinegar to taste anything. I might come back here to try their other dishes, but I will be going to Shanghai Asian Manor down the street next time I am craving soup dumplings.",0
"I came here. I ordered what people on yelp said to order. I couldn't even finish my dumplings. It was not good at all and I'm appalled that it has such high ratings on yelp. Seriously people.

I kind of like the fact that you share a table with people. It's a nice way to socialize.",0
"So thoroughly overrated. So pissed that I ate here. Everything was bad- the waitstaff, the space, the food. Everything. There is 0 to redeem this place. How does it have this reputation. I've had soup dumplings in so many other places that are so much better. The only piece of food we had that was slightly tasty was the scallion pancake. My wife had noodles that were bland and tasted like they had been cooked in fat (Yuck) My father in laws dish of beef was tasteless and had been fried to a crisp. My dish of chicken was bland as well. Even their tableside hot condiment was bland (how can this be???) The service was rude, they forgot about us, our drinks were never filled, etc. The space is terribly loud and cramped, which we could all overlook if their food was stellar. But, it's not. There are so many places in this city, places in Manhattan, outside of Chinatown, in Queens, in Brooklyn, that have such better food. I would never, ever come back to this poor excuse for a restaurant.",0
"I've had a good sampling of XLB (xiao long bao aka soup dumplings) in Chinatown and this place delivers tasty ones.  They have a good broth, don't break too easily (but aren't too doughy) and pack some porky flavor.  However, this place is a one trick pony.  Everything else on the menu doesn't wow--it's average at best and is very ""Americanized"" (greasy, food court type, overly sauced).  Don't think it's worth the long wait, but it is a fun experience.  

By the way, while you are waiting there is a great bar around the corner called Apotheke--check it out!",0
Dumplings! thats what people come here for they tasted alright... I think the best part of this was community seating and chatting it up with random people.,0
"I wonder why Joe's Shanghai is considered as a tourist spot. The food seemed decent to me and there was nothing special about the restaurant itself. The day I went, it was lunchtime, and my Chinese lawyer friends who work in Chinatown decided to take me here since I was a tourist. They admitted it wasn't the best in NY, but I was game just to see what it was all about.

The walk to Joe's was right through Chinatown. As I was following my friends, I just kept getting distracted by all the shops. It looked like they all sell the same stuff just like they do in Asia. When we finally got to Joe's Shanghai it was around 3PM and there wasn't a wait. We got seated right away at a large round table later to be joined by other patrons whom we didn't know. Since this was just a late afternoon snack, we just got a couple orders of the soup dumplings.

Now, this wasn't my first time trying soup dumplings. Luckily for me, the first time I went my friend told me exactly how to eat them. Pick one up with your chopsticks and put it in your spoon. Poke a hole so the broth comes out. Blow, slurp, and chew. If it weren't for his step by step instruction, I'm sure I would've severely burned my mouth off because those suckers are scalding hot!

Joe's soup dumplings were nothing to brag about. They had good flavor, but I could tell the broth was extra fatty, and the health conscious freak inside me was freaking out about it. I think I preferred the soup dumplings at Din Tai Fung better, but theirs are just extremely overpriced.",0
"Plus: Um ... the service was good and the wait wasn't as long as I thought it was going to be. The soup dumplings were aiite. It wasn't anything to go crazy over like everyone claims. (I'm from Rowland Heights where the Chinese food is hella on-point)

Delta: I actually don't know what everyone's raving about. I felt that the place was overpriced for what it was. I came here with my sister and her husband who I have not seen in so long and to be seated next to another family just made for a really awkward, unpleasant ,and loud-speaking conversation when I just wanted to catch up with them. I think if you're looking to enjoy some quality conversation, you really should not be going to Joe's Shanghai.

Maybe I need to go back to this place and assess it again. I haven't been here in well over a year due to my horrible experience.

"don't know why everyone loves the dumplings..thought they were gross. shanghai noodles were good, but nothing special",0
"I've been here about 3 times already and was lucky enough to not have to wait for a table.

First of all, the sign says Joe's Ginger which made me unsure of whether this is the place everyone raves about. Secondly, I had the soup dumplings and while I think they were good. I didn't see the hype. I've never had a soup dumpling I didn't like and this didn't seem that much better than other places. We ordered spring rolls on a whim and they were cold in the middle. Service sucks like most places in Chinatown. But this trip was more of an in-and-out rather than a hangout.",0
"I don't know how to give 0 star so I guess I need to give at least 1 star! Too bad!
I don't understand why people line up for this junk! To be honest, there is better xiao long bao (shanghai style small steamed pork buns) in Flushing and besides offering bad service, bad food, they also offer some rip off too!

Food:
Worst I have ever tried on earth! I ordered xiao long bao and sauteed baby shrimp; the pork is not fresh; buns are poorly shaped; the shrimps of course is not fresh and I could only taste corn flour of it.

Environment:
If you consider ....dirty and very unattractive; very crowded and who wants to share table with someone you don't know at all?

Service:
What? That's service? I don't really think that's any! The major thing I really want to make clear here: pal, you have right to decide how much you want to give your gratuity for the service you just enjoyed...BUT not to be forced giving a 15% ""service charge"" in your bill without being told/ mentioned anywhere in the menu. And I also believe most people didn't realized that they paid the tips already and they paid again after checking out. So, if you know you have to go, CHECK YOUR BILL AND DON'T DOUBLE PAID THEM!

Overall:
Garbage!",0
The service are pretty bad. There are other ppl order after us got dish before ask. And when I ask the waiter he actually shout at me.,0
"SOUP DUMPLINGS. Love it.
I also tried the shrimp lo mein but it tastes like every other lo mein (nothing special). Just get the soup dumplings.

I would've given this place four..maybe five stars if it wasn't for the service. Poor service and they seat you in the most random places.. The second time I went, my friend and I were seated in one of those round tables that're usually used for groups. We sat almost leg-to-leg with other customers and had barely any space to move which got really awkward and uncomfortable. The third time I went, I was seated right next to the trash can and where they store dirty dishes which was really unpleasant since it started smelling like trash.. The waiters seem a bit rude as well. They just want you to eat then leave. I asked for hot sauce and they leaned over our food to get the hot sauce on the other table and said, ""here. Use this."" 

I've been to the one in Flushing as well and it's so much more worth it to go to that one. Only thing is that you have to wait for so long to be seated, but this one in Chinatown seats you fairly quickly.",0
"Their waiting Service is very bad. The worst I have ever seen. You wait in a queue depends on how many people in your group. Which means if you have four people coming in instead of 2 ppl, even though you wait in queue earlier than four people group. They will let four ppl group go first. Because they have more four ppl tables than 2.",0
"Everyone loves Joe's. This is a soup dumpling place, but I though the Gen CHWS was better. It may be me but soup dumplings smell like my grandmothers freezer. Not the one in the house the one in the garage. I'd say go or order In if you like soup dumplings.",0
"I heard that Joe's Shanghai is famous for their xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), so I decided to drop by on Sunday to give them a try. There were no seats available so I asked for 2 orders of xiaolongbao (8 dumplings per order) to go. 

The dumplings looked very sad and deflated in the to go containers. The soup dumplings in the Yelp photos look very full and pillowy, so maybe the dumplings here are best eaten fresh. I did not enjoy the taste and texture of these xiaolongbao as much as the xiaolongbao from Nan Xiang Dumpling House in Flushing. The skin felt too doughy and the meat/broth did not taste as flavorful.

I'd like to come back and get a table next time so that I can try the fresh dumplings that they serve here.",0
"Overhyped and not consistent. I've only been here once so maybe we were unlucky, but the state of our xiao long baos were unnacceptable. 

Food: My friend and I only got the pork xiao long bao and scallion pancakes to share-- the pancakes were great, but our dumplings were so soggy and floppy that they came ripped and stuck to each other/to the basket, causing all the soup to spill out.  The flavor of the soup wasn't that great either in my opinion. We showed the waiter and he offered us new dumplings (but 2 dumplings because we had 2 left), which was nice, but I couldn't believe the dumplings came out like that

Service: There's usually a wait to get in, it wasn't too bad for us (15-20 min) on a Sunday afternoon. Service is prompt; our waiter couldn't really understand my questions, but that's fine. 

Atmosphere: It was definitely packed in there and tables were places very close to each other.

Basically, overhyped. I've had better xiao long baos/shanghainese food elsewhere that didn't have a wait.",0
"I sometimes go to the one in Flushing because my hubby loves their soup dumplings. I, on the other hand, not so crazy about their food. Perhaps because my home is northern China, the flavor of things are just not quite the same. Southern cuisine are often too sweet and too saucy, and their dishes are like the better Chinese take-out that I get from the neighborhood.  The decor of the restaurant is just like many of the older Chinese restaurants in the city, bright with fluorescent light and loud chatters. It would not be a good place to take your date to, forget about  intimate conversations. Their service is efficient and direct, like many of the Chinese places. ""What's your order"", followed by delivery of food, followed by delivery of the check. It's what I like to call ""Eat and Get Out"".

The prices are pretty reasonable. But if you're in Flushing, you could get so much more for your money by visiting the small hole-in-the-walls.",0
"We wanted to go to their other famous Joe's restaurant but there were people waiting outside so we decided to come here instead. There was no waiting time and we were seated on the second floor.
We ordered pork and crab dumplings but I couldn't tell the difference at all... We also ordered fried rice, morning glory stirfry and a pork stir fry, all of these portions were super tiny (maybe my friend ordered the small size??)
But anyways it's not even a one-person portion so be aware of that.
Also once you are done with your meal, they immediately give you the bill, and if you don't pay ASAP they come and stand in front of you until you give them the money.
Not very pleasant service, but hey, it's Chinatown so what can you expect right...",0
"Finally ate in Chinatown and picked a place based on Yelp reviews, (like usual) and was impressed by Shanghai Joe's having so many reviews and accolades from mainstream media. Cold sesame noodles, braised duck and Szechuan tofu were my favorites. Other dishes were not as flavorful. Next time I'll look for a top-rated option that has fewer reviews, less well known.",0
This place is a tourist trap. Very basic dumplings. It's not even good and nothing special. I don't know what's the hype is all about. Din Tai Fung makes way better dumplings than this place. Do not go there.,0
Food is decent. The soupy dumpling are good. Service is horrendous. Do not like the fact that they add tip to bill even if service was bad especially the people who seat you. The worst restaurant for groups as they will threaten to not seat you if a single member of your party has nota arrived yet. Overall the shanghai restaurants on mott st are better. The only thing good here are the dumplings.,0
"This is the one time that Yelp has failed me. This place has seemingly positive reviews, but it just didn't do it for me.

The restaurant is not big by any stretch. We had a group of 6 people and yet they still sat us at this table that probably could fit 4 max. The food was alright. I've definitely had better XLB's. The XLB skin ripped easily, so before I can even put the damn thing in my mouth, all the juice (there wasn't much juice to begin with) was gone. As far as the the service, I felt like it was crap. I say that because this dude taking away our dirty dishes then proceeding to drop those dishes on the floor, which in turn dropped the leftover stuff from those dishes onto my jacket, which is hard to clean. No apology, no nothing. Imagine all the juice from the XLB that popped out and stayed on those dishes and then having it all on your jacket. That's what happened. 

If you like to buy into the hype of restaurants, then try it. But if you want good XLB's this is not your place.",0
"Dined here while we visited NY since my husband loves soup dumplings and Joe's Shanghai is known for them. I was actually very disappointed this time around. 

We got the pork & crab dumplings, pork dumplings, chicken fried rice and general tso's chicken. Nothing tasted spectacular. The dumplings were not the best this time around. We both recall them being amazing! The fried rice just okay, looked and tasted too wet though, not very authentic. Lastly, the general Yao's chicken. Typically I wouldn't have ordered this but my daughter's friend wanted it so we did. Chicken was a bit dry, sauce was tasty though. 

Wish we left satisfied :/",0
"After all the hype and looking at the pics which looks so good!!! We decided to stop here after visiting the 9/11 memorial!! Walking inside the was a weird smell which made me feel iffy about the place!!! We ordered food pics from photos seen on yelp that looks good!! But once our order came in, we tried the Shanghai flat noodles and it was not as good as what yelpers say!!! The dumpling to me was ok, nothing special!! After ordering so much food, my tummy was not satisfy!! Hate goin into a restaurant and it just didn't hit the spot!! Not only that but u have to share a table w other people so it kinda makes it akward waiting for their food and just stare at us eating!!!",0
"I couldn't remember when was the last time I went there, this time was to treat a friend in town because of its name. All the food we ordered including the soup dumplings were subpar, too doughy thick and hard on top, I've had better. Good for their business though, it's just a tourist cult and trap to me.",0
"I have been here twice 1st time I was here without the kids and thought food was ok and I would have rated it 3 stars. Noting over the top family style dining sharing  table with strangers. Service was also just ok. 2nd time we stopped by with my kids and let me tell u service was just horrible. This is my 1st bad review at Yelp. I don't like giving bad reviews but this deserves a bad review. 1st the waiter was not polite at all, he was not trying to hep with menu and really not accommodating. We needed plates, juices for kids he left for good 5 10 min we had to ask another waiter for help. Then the waiter kept taking to the people next to us the whole time in Chinese laughing and just chatting away. At one point he was kept passing my by my chair and rubbing against my back without saying anything.. I had to tell him to stop rubbing against my back every minute. He wasn't passes dishes or anything he  just kept talking to the people at the table not paying attention to us. We didn't feel comfortable at all. I told him straight up that he sucked and to stop rubbing against me, and then I spoke to the manager how horrible service was but nothing was done about it, just apologized. I will never go back no matter how good these saggy dumplings are!!",0
#1 dumplings on the appetizer menu were delicious. Everything else is blah! They also add msg which made my head hurt.,0
"If you want to try the real things, I sincerely suggest you got to Philadelphia. The dumplings in Dim Sum Garden is million times better.",0
"FOOD - 3/5
The portion sizes here are so generous, the xiao long baos were huge!! The food was okay, somewhat of a hit or miss because while the fried rice was super good, the taiwanese beef noodle soup was pretty bland.

SERVICE - 4/5
The restaurant had a ton of tables inside so we got seated immediately even if it was during lunch hour. The servers were super attentive and efficient. The only thing I would mention is that this place was cash only so make sure you bring enough!

AMBIANCE - 5/5
Thought the decor was veryyy nice for a casual Chinatown spot. Loved all the lighting inside and it felt so spacious even though many of the tables were filled. Surprisingly also had clean bathrooms which were much appreciated!",0
"I decided to choose Joe's Shanghai solely because of high rated Yelp reviews. I've been to many restaurants in Chinatown and this has been my least favorite. The service wasn't attentive and was very rushed. The seating was tight and table very cramped. The food overall was average. It took a very long time for a Wonton soup, which I thought was a little weird. There wasn't anything special about it. At least it wasn't terrible, but definitely not the best I've had. I expected more coming from this restaurant.",0
"Finally had the opportunity to try this place while visiting friends in Flushing. The food was delightful but I really cant give more than three stars..

The beef soup dumplings were delicious. Pretty big sized dumplings with lots of soup inside. As delicious as it was, I feel more partial to Petite Soo Chow's in Cliffside Park.

The service is terrible. Go with someone who can speak Chinese or you'll be ignored most of the night.",0
"Not to be a downer, but maybe soup dumplings are just not my thing. Tried two varieties of XLB as well as the green onion pancake and thought it was pretty good but nothing special. Nice to say that I've tried it, but not crave-worthy.",0
Soup dumplings were good but not worth the terrible service we received. Didn't ask if we needed water or anything! They know the service sucks so they add a 15% tip to your bill regardless of your party size.,0
"This place is just ok, not as good as I remember it. The crab dumplings were fine but I remember the Joe's Shanghai of old being a bit more delicious when it came to dumplings and such. Still good, but nothing to write home about.",0
"The waiters are very unfriendly, they just want to done their job. We have to share table with others. The food was good but I was been unhappy by them. Won't go back",0
"I have had Joes Shanghai in Midtown and Flushing. I hated one in Chinatown. Four out of eight the xiaolongbao came out already ripped and leaked. I regret that i didnt complain. So my ranking is from the best to the worst: Flushing, Midtown(although bit expensive), Chinatown(worst service and food).",0
"We took our parents to dinner today. The front desk gave us a number and told us to wait. When our number was called, we were taken into the restaurant to share a table with other people. It turned out that we only had a seat for 2 people, and they drove us out and asked us to line up again.  , I went to the front desk and asked her what was going on, she replied that I meant 2 people, do you think it's a bit of a business and doesn't care about the number of guests, you can drive away guests at will, and drive away guests before they have eaten, what kind of service is this, dishes  nothing will happen,",0
This place was pretty good. First time trying dim sum and it was for sure different. I think I might of enjoyed my time more if the service was better.,0
"NOT that great .... Service is horrible . Waited over an hour for a table which is fine but the hostess were very very rude and snappy . Shanghai buns were not good at all . Not sure why people rave about this place . Compared to the bao, these buns are not even close to how dumpling soup should taste like . The only good things about the place is the general Tso and the fried rice . Also be prepared to sit with other parties at a table. There are definitely other places better than this restaurant . It wasn't worth the wait and the food was mediocre . If your looking for tasty buns , go to the bao early in the morning !",0
"We passed by the restaurant many times and finally got a chance to try it. 
We ordered the xiaolong bao, the scallion pancake, the lion head, the peppy fried pork chop, the pan fried noodles. 
The must-try are the bao and pancake. The bao is very juicy and good deal. The pancake is crispy and delicious    
The pork chop is too dry. The noodle is too salty. To us, they are not as good as the ones in other restaurant.
The lion head is disappointed  the first one is overcooked and it is all black. I have no  idea why the chef and waitress didn't notice.",0
"Food came out hot, fresh, and fast. The XLB were a bit larger than I'm used to, and while I was excited to try the crab and pork soup dumpling, the crab had a strong fishy taste so I unfortunately didn't enjoy them.

The texture of the scallion pancakes were great and they tasted fresh. They were a bit disappointing though as they were super oily--didn't feel like I could stomach more than one piece. Very few scallions as well, and could have used some salt in my opinion!",0
"Overrated. The soup dumplings taste like they've been sitting in the back for 10-min before they were brought out. The shanghai noodles were way too salty and Americanized. The dumpling wrappers were too thick. I mean... It wasn't ""bad bad"" it just wasn't good. Totally did not live up to the hype... Kinda bummed I wasted a meal in NYC on this place.

The two good things: service and the hot sauce.",0
"Disclaimer!!!!!! You will sit at a table with strangers!!! You are lucky if you get a table with just your party. We were not aware of this and skipped all the reviews that said this. Worth the hype? I mean they were good but not worth the wait, poor service and sitting with strangers. Our table was full of lovely people but I felt like I was intruding in their space. The waiters kept reaching over and in between while we were eating. They also charge you an automatic a 15% tip for them giving you the menu and not refilling your water. Tip: Don't come hungry, came Saturday evening around 545, didn't sit till 7. Everyone came rolling in after that, it was crowded. Go inside to get a number, there is no line, claim your spot.",0
"Food: it's good, not great.
Service: leaves much to be desired. Our waiter walked away from us irritated and rolling his eyes after we ordered 2 orders of soup dumplings. We had to call him back to tell him we wanted to order more food. He must have thought we were lowly tourists coming to try a trendy spot. 
Also, I hate communal tables. I had to sit sideways in my chair to keep from staring at another couple across the table. 

We tried both the crab and pork XLB. I liked them both but didn't find the broth to be as savory and rich as some of the places in Jersey that I like. I have no doubt you could find yummier XLB in Chinatown. 

We also shared a tofu dish that my boyfriend loved but I found slightly too sweet. It was #100 on the menu. It was quite oily too. Every bite I took of tofu, a hot stream of water and grease poured down my chin and I felt the ghost of future zits forming in it's wake. 

Glad I tried it but wouldn't run back anytime soon.",0
"Joe's Shanghai was recommended to me by a coworker, who knows I love soup, when she found out I was taking a trip to NYC. I came here about 10 PM on a Friday after having dinner at a nearby noodle spot in Chinatown and the place was still going strong on a dinner rush. We were seated at a shared table and immediately asked if we wanted soup dumplings, their specialty. We ordered pork and another woman at the table ordered the crab.

I was actually really excited for this considering this is pretty much THE spot to get dumplings but when they came out most of them had already cracked and were losing broth. My favorite part of the dumpling is slurping out the broth before munching and this presentation made it near impossible. When trying to grab them with tongs the bun would stick and more times than not tear apart the buns.

The flavor was good but the experience was not there. If it wasn't for the company of some fun strangers who we all shared our dishes with, I probably would have left sooner. I will probably order an entree soup alongside my dumplings next time just in case.",0
"""You ordered the Siamese Chicken!""

""No we didn't.""

""Yes you did!""

""No we didn't""

""Yes you did!""

""No.""

annnnnd scene.  For the sake of all that is holy with soup dumplings, being told what I ordered is like telling a fat man to eat a rice cake.  I order what I ordered and I don't enjoy being told otherwise.

There's 136 reviews for this place and they all focus on the food and they're right, the food is awesome.  The price is fantastic.  And the fact that they can serve large groups is fabulous.  But their service needs a lot of freakin' work.  I'll go to Green Bo instead.",0
Overrated. There are also better options for soup dumplings in Chinatown,0
"Joe's Shanghai was once THE place for soup dumplings in NYC.  Unfortunately, that was 15 years ago.  Yes, their soup dumplings are good but it's not worth the wait.  Their shanghai noodles are too oily. I only go if visitors insist on trying it and the wait is minimal.",0
"Yes this place is super touristy, but their XLB/soup dumpling is sure tasty! It says pork bun on menu but if you say soup dumpling, they know what you are talking about! 

I am truly indifferent to their sometimes rude service and lack of cleanliness, but Joe's always provides one heck of an experience!! Their soup dumplings just explode with soup and go so well with the low selection of sauces they have on the table for you to share with 4 or more people. Whether you be sharing a table with random strangers, slurping so much soup of your plate because you don't know how the hell to eat soup dumplings, or questioning why there is an automatic service charge, you got to love this place for what it is and you got to bring your friends and why not the whole freaking family to experience the Joe's Shanghai way!!",0
"First off this place only accepts cash. Also a 15% service charge was added to the bill and I was dining by myself. 

I am shocked at the reviews for this place. I should have known what I was in for when I walk in and noticed that only 8% of the patrons were Asian. In a place like Chinatown, follow the Asians for the best authentic place to eat. 

Ordered the soup dumplings since so many people raved about it. I thought the outer dumpling skin was thick and you had to chew at it to break through. However the soup and meat inside did have a nice flavor. 

I also ordered the Shanghai Noodle Soup with flat noodles. I am sure this is a regional dish but it looked like beef Lo Mein. The soup looked like a gravy abut it was oily and it should have been more flavorful. The shredded cabbage and spinach was fine but I was disappointed. 

If in Chinatown for the day go somewhere else and enjoy a more authentic meal.",0
"Come here for the soup dumplings, but nothing else! The soup dumplings are great but the other dishes are inauthentic and taste more like americanized asian food than Shanghai cuisine. Furthermore, this is a very touristy restaurant; expect to wait at least half an hour during peak times. That being said, the second time I came we got a fried bean curd dish that was a seasonal special at the time and actually very tasty!",0
"THIS PLACE IS ALWAYS PACKED so don't be weirded out when youre seated and bumping elbows with complete strangers at your table. 

Jenny S. and I got Scallion pancake and XLBs.. There's not too much else that I can say bout this place.. looks like the 1500+ reviews have already said everything I wouldve said.

Both the XLBs and the scallion pancake were good, but nothing to rave about. The soup tasted a little off.. kinda like a slight sour, tap-waterish taste. Can't quite describe it.. maybe a bit gamey perhaps?

Scallion pancakes.. good, but even MORE greasy than most places I've had. It's almost like its deep fried and THEN pan fried.. had a little extra bite to it. Not something I'd necessarily crave, but hey, it was different.",0
"I'm giving their soup dumplings 3 stars because the broth is too salty and it lacked sweetness. 

If you're willing to drive out to Flushing, I highly recommend going to Nanxiang. They make much better dumplings. 

But if you're starving and want something cheap and satisfying, Joe's Shanghai is not too shabby.",0
"If you're coming here for the soup dumplings and other dim sum or appetizers this place is great. We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes which were absolutely amazing. Based solely on these two items (the service and entrees not included) I would give this place 5 stars. 

However, our entrees were inedible. I ordered the Szechuan fish filet, which looked great but I could not eat more than two bites before getting grossed out. The sauce was super thin and about 50% grease and oil. It had good spiciness but  not much flavor. The texture of the fish itself was slimy. My boyfriend ordered the sesame chicken which was over cooked resulting in a chewy center and an almost burnt but somehow not crispy outside. 

Our waiter (probably the worst part) was rude from the start and obviously noticed that we were not happy with our food as we were sitting there not eating with full plates in front of us. I attempted to waive him down yet he would not even look in our direction. Finally a different waiter came over to check on us. He was very pleasant and told us he could refund one of the meals. I wish they had refunded both as we both couldn't get down more than 2 bites and both dishes were over $15 but at that point I was happy to get anything refunded. 

We were just really disappointed! Being in Chinatown, we were expecting to be wowed by the Chinese food however the take out near us was much better. I would say pick a different place to eat in Chinatown -- unless you only want soup dumplings and can deal with a rude staff.",0
Worst dumplings in New York. Soggy bok choy cooked in motor oil. Singapore noodles tasted like the inside of an old jar of curry. The chicken was dry. The shrimps looked like shriveled baby dicks with black veins. Overpriced!,0
So-so food... I am not coming back to crappy service and below-standard facilities for a bunch of xiaolongbao.,0
"It is a raucously noisy place with a rather inattentive wait staff. But you're not going here for the ambiance or the service. You're going for the cheap, relatively well-cooked (as in, not overcooked or bland), American-style Chinese food. And for the soup dumplings as everyone else mentioned. They are delicious. Another great find is the rice cakes. We also had a vegetable that translated means ""hole in the middle,"" and it was flavorful, well-cooked and a good addition to the starch and meat heavy meal. To top is off, this place is byob. Go with your group of 10 or more friends, bring some wine and slurp up your dumplings.",0
"lord knows how many nights i have thought mournfully to myself that i should have kidnapped the woman who made xiaolongmantou (soup dumplings) down the street from our apt in shanghai, and brought her back here as my 'aunty'.

my craving for these little bursting morsels of joy can never be tamed.  nothing in any big us city that i've had comes close to 'old world', but when i needed a fix, this place did me well.  i ate an order to myself, and it wasn't expensive.  the other food here was pretty good as well, though not spectacular.  i'd say 4 STARS for FOOD.

however, it's very crowded and the staff is rather, shall we say, brusque.  i don't mind sharing tables with other parties, and i don't mind busy waitstaff not doting on me, but dude .. i do need to speak to you at least once.  without you scowling.",0
It would be better if the food could be more fresh!!! Really not as good as expected! Long queue waiting for disappointment!,0
"It was not even super crowded like usual Friday or Saturday, almost claustrophobic.  I was there last Sunday. The service was the worst of any restaurant. They were giving us an attitude. Mumbling in front and behind our backs. Literally throw the food on our table. It was not just one waiter, all of them acted that way. Just because they have a lot of customers.  They should not treat their customers like that. They seem to want to push us or kick us out.  The been crepe dessert I've order was not edible.  I'm not going back anymore.",0
I've been going to Joe's for decades. It's become so touristy that it's lost it's appeal. We waited 1.5 hours (after being told 40 minutes).  The service was below par and the food was pretty average. Very disappointing since it used to be so good.,0
"Went here with the old lady, got two different types of dumplings one was pork and one was pork and something else with the soups it was pretty good

There was no asians eating- all different ethnicities

I was the only asian

Super busy, i liked it

$30 bucks for two people",0
"After a long wait for  a table.  I was so excited to try their famous pork soup dumplings.  AND I was not impressed !  As for other dishes I've ordered,  they were OK.",0
"If you Asian or Asian tourist don't eat at this place,  it's not worth it. Nothing special with the pork dumpling and the fried rice. It's expensive too!.
They put us sitting together with 3 other parties! The waiters kept bumping to my chair. This is like eating in a market. I rather go to Din Dai Fung same price but you eat in peace and happier!",0
"I was already pissed off that when I opened the door, two men walked straight in without saying thank you and they happened to be workers.
Then I got more pissed off that they put us in a combined table when there was like 6 other patrons in the restaurant.
Then I got more pissed off that one of the waiters tried to kick us out after our XLB even though we had another dish coming.
Then I was not happy that we had to pay 15% gratuity. Not that I wouldn't have, but it'd be nice to have a choice.
And, of course, I was not happy when the food made me nauseous on the way home and I puked it out at home.
However, the XLB was not as good as I thought it would be. The soup inside is very rich and the skin is pretty thick. It seems that the places that are hyped up on Yelp never seem to be that awesome. Then we ordered the shredded eel and yellow chives. Holy crap. That was the grossest thing I've ever seen - everything was just overdosed in sauce and we just left 3/4 of the dish untouched and did not pack it to go. Overall, no, never again.",0
This place is so over rated and full with tourist. It doesn't even taste good. I ordered their soup dumplings which they're known for and had to send it back twice because it tasted like the meat went bad. HORRIBLE! you could not pay me to eat here,0
"CASH-ONLY! Push your way up to the waitress, get your name on the list, wait 5 minutes, and be seated at a table with others already with their mouths full, and say ""YES!"" to SOUP DUMPLINGS - one of each! Two layers will come out and they'll teach you how to slurp these surprising dim sum yummmmmmms. It's super cheap and super packed. Yum yum!",0
"This place is okay. It's definitely not the best I ever had, and I would definitely not wait more than 10-15 minutes to eat here.

Thankfully, while the lines are usually pretty long, but we got in after about a 5 minute wait since we came in at 9pm on a rainy Monday. They seat everyone at a communal table (fine by me), and you sort of get your own little section to order and eat.

We got the normal xlb and a crab + pork xlb. We also got a Shanghai Noodle. Honestly, the Shanghai Noodle was the best, followed by Crab xlb, then Pork xlb. 

The xlb tasted sort of old and reheated; the skin was a little hard at the top and bloated at the bottom. It sort of felt mass produced, lacking any sort of care into actually doing it right. Perhaps on a less busy day or years ago before they got really popular, I could imagine it being way better, but I'd be astonished if they were really the best xlb in the city.

I mean, I didn't really expect it to be the best; but I still thought it would be good. It's pretty lackluster and if I had any more time in the city I'm sure I could find a better place. At least the prices haven't grown with the popularity, so there is a silver lining in all this!",0
"This place is okay.  Its a tourist place and pretty crowded so you may have to share tables.  Their Xiao Lung Bao is okay, I like Crystal Jade Lai Mein Xiao Lung Bao in Hong Kong better.  

I went here a couple of times and the price is very reasonable but very crowded.  Both times I was here, I had to share tables.",0
"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! We were told the line is estimated to be about 15 mins. Cool. It's our first time here, we wanted to wait inside cos it started raining. The girl at the front told us to wait around the corner and not inside. Okay we waited around the corner. After like 20 mins I was like why is it taking so long? But thought maybe they're just busy. Finally after 30 mins we decided to ask the girl when will it be our turn. Lol turns out she already called our number? I've been looking at her she doesn't even step a foot out of that restaurant, how can she expect us to hear her when she's the one that told us to wait around the corner? 

You would think they should put you back on top as a priority but no lol, she had the audacity to tell us we needed to wait longer aka putting us at the bottom of the list again?? I can't believe she was serious. Overall bad experience right from the start. There are so many other Shanghainese restaurants around here. We will not be coming back in the future.

Edit: manager and server were pretty good so an extra star for them.",0
"I'm not super impressed with the xiao long bao's , and I miss ding tai fong! Joe's Shanghai is a super crowded chinese restaurant in Chinatown and you're usually seated at large round communal tables where you dine with 10 strangers. I don't mind doing that if I could at least get good XLB. The soup dumplings here are good but not great. The skin is very thick, and in Asian cuisine, getting thinner skin on the XLB is an art without breaking the shell. Joe's shanghai seems more crude to me because of that. There is a LOT of soup in the XLB which is fantastic, and the broth is rich and fatty. However, the soup dumplings still pale in comparison to other places in California and Asia. We also got the spicy fried whole fish, which was just OK in my opinion. It was doused in sweet and sour sauce, tasted like it was made more for an American palate than anything else. Overall the place felt like americanized chinese food (though with the slow/random service, you wouldn't think it).  I'd say if you're craving XLB in manhattan, come here for a temporary fix until you can go somewhere better for the same price. Also do not go to the one in midtown because that's a rip off.",0
"We came here to get some soup dumplings. We ordered the crab and pork - I was expecting it to be bombtastic per the reviews, but it was subpar compared to din tai fung's soup dumplings. I wanted to like it, but it was just so-so.",0
"On our rare weekend free, we decided to grab some Chinese food in the City after failing to find much good Chinese food in the Jersey area we were living in. After hearing the recommendations from natives in the area as well as seeing the awesome reviews on Yelp, we ventured out that Sunday afternoon to see what all the hype was about. Maybe it was the fact that my expectations were too high (after all, my family is from Shanghai and I was just there that summer eating the most authentic of xiao long baos), but the soup dumplings at Joe's didn't impress me all that much. The soup inside was overly oily and they were just so large that it was a bit overwhelming. However, I do have to say that it's impressive that there was a spoonful of soup in each dumpling. We tried the pork and the crab ones...definitely go for the pork ones if you do decide to go. The crab ones were too ... I'm not sure what the word is in English ... but almost too fishy/seafoody tasting? We also got wontons and an eggplant dish which were pretty average as well. The next time I'm in the city, I'll probably be trying something new...",0
"2.5 stars. We ordered the crab soup dumplings and the pork dumplings. No complaints about the service, I asked for extra ginger to eat with the dumplings and the servers were quick to bring them out. I am not sure if it's fair to compare Joe's to Din Tai Fung because Joe's is a lot cheaper - for $5 you get 8 pork soup dumplings. However, the thickness of the dough and the greasiness of the soup made the whole eating experience seemed more like a chore instead of feeling like I am stuffing deliciousness into my mouth which is how I feel when I am eating at DinTai Fung. For a place so highly rated for its XLB, I was disappointed.",0
"I LOVE the crabmeat dumpling!

But sadly that's the only high light. Other dishes are just ok. Or if you go to Joe in 5th ave, try the duck smt in the special menu. It's pretty delicious.

Grab a bubble tea nearby if you have to wait in line. But share it or do not finish it cause you'll be too full for the food.

Oh and Im also really impressed by an old waiter's table-setup skill in Joe Chinatown. A must see!",0
"Meh... this place is so overrated. Perhaps it was really really good many years ago? I do not know. At least now that I know after having waited almost 40 mins for seats, the food was not worth the wait at all. 
The xia long bao was so so. While it was juicy, the meat inside was rather bland and the sauce has a greasy feel to it. The dough on the top of the dumpling is thick and boring. 
Garlic stir fried bak choi is stringy. 
The shanghai stir fried noodles, which is supposed to be one of the staples, is so bland and mushy. Very disappointing. 
Tea is watered down,no taste",0
Food going downhill. Skin of Soup dumplings are thick and not enough soup. Service is rushed and rude. Ambiance is noisy and crowded. This dining experience is not worth the wait,0
"The food is great. The 18% service fee is not. I don't know how they get away with it, but it really left a bad taste on otherwise a nice meal.",0
"Ordered delivery last night and all I can say is, no fortune cookies?! From what I ordered, I can comment that Orange beef was a bit tougher and small portion for the price.",0
"quite frankly, this place has been overrated by many, and i don't know how it started but the dumplings are not bad at all.  although my favorite is still at a hole in a wall places nearby...",0
"On a cold spring night in NY, three friends and I trekked over to Joe's Shanghai hoping to saturate our ever-hungry taste buds with delicious XLB juice. The experience? Meh.

The wait was an hour before we were seated at a huge table that we awkwardly shared with two other parties. Stuffing face in front of a stranger is an interesting dining experience, to say the least.

We ordered two orders of XLB, Shanghai noodles, green oinion pancake, and pea sprouts. The XLB broth was not flavorful enough and the skin was too thick. The meat was just ok. The Shanghai noodles were a disappointment, lukewarm and flavorless. The green onion pancake was very greasy. They did a fine job with the veggies (pea sprouts in garlic, can't really mess that up), although they didn't have gai lan. What kind of Chinese restaurant doesn't have gai lan? Maybe I'm just spoiled by all the fresh produce in SF? Another note: 15% tip is added automatically to all checks.

In any case, it was the cheapest meal I ate during my entire trip in NY, so I was satisfied (and giving it one extra star for the cheap factor). But it definitely did not live up to the Yelp reviews. Sorry, peeps!",0
"Went the first time and thought it was great. However going the second time it was super bland. They messed up on one of my soups which is not a problem, however, they didn't take it to well when I told them about correcting their mistake. I personally don't take it personal and even liked the gritty ness of the 'unique' customer service. It gives it the fun NYC Chinatown experience haha. If I base it off the first time experience it's 4 to 5 stars but if it was the second time it would be a pure zero for lack of taste.",0
"Worse service ever!!!!!!!!!!! I went there with my family and we waited in the cold for over an hour, they kept telling us we will be next and the table we were waiting for finally cleared! And!!!  They sat another  group of ppl on that table which they came wayyyyyy after us! Just because those ppl know the staff over there!!!  Speechless!!!!!!  And the food werent so  good anyway, not worth the wait and the hpassle! We ended up just left that stupid place! Never going back again! Worse place I've ever been to.......",0
"We ordered 2 orders of shrimp fried rice and an order of kungpao chicken. 
The rice was tasteless. No flavor whatsoever, it literally tasted like nothing. The kungpao had zero hints of spice and the peanuts to chicken ratio was ridiculous. We were truly surprised at the lack of flavor cause it was so popular and packed when we went in, such a disappointment.",0
"As long as I've been alive, I've been eating xiao long bao. They have been a mainstay of my childhood and a continued addiction into adulthood. Joe's Shanghai in Flushing was the one of the first restaurants that I remember eating XLBs at. Although I had heard rumors that the Joe's brand was rapidly declining, I never really thought about it too much since I had already dedicated myself to another XLB joint. When my friends and I decided to try the Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown I was a bit wary of the meal. I went in with no to low expectations. 

Unfortunately the rumors were true. Joe's Shanghai had become a typical tourist trap with an incredibly long wait time. The restaurant itself mirrored that of any other chinatown eatery, low ceilings and a bit grimy. I've never really had a problem with the ambiance, especially when the kitchen would put out good food. Unfortunately with nothing tasty to distract me I couldn't help but notice the other problems with the store. 

The food was incredibly subpar. I usually remember my meals very well but I can only think of negative things from Joe's. Normally soup dumplings should be served immediately after they had finished steaming. Unfortunately all the soup dumplings my group had received tasted as if they were sitting under a heat lamp. Instead of a delicate skin, the dumpling had a rough texture and would consistently with sticking to each other. When soup dumplings sit for a while, the skin starts to break down with the soup inside threatening to escape, making the entire experience worthless when the soup gets wasted on the plate. 

Although my group of five had spent a clear 70-80$ on dinner here, we all felt unsatisfied and went down the street to a noodle house to have an amazing 5$ noodle bowl. To this day, I still count the noodles as being my actual dinner, with Joe's being whatever it was. 

On top of the poor quality food, I felt as if the prices were a bit too high for the area. Joe's Shanghai felt as if they had inflated prices to take advantage of tourists. If it's your first time eating xiao long bao, Joe's Shanghai would be a good place to set your lowest bar.",0
"Didn't like the service, got scoffed at when asking what a dish contained, which did end up containing something we didnt like.
Was hastily brought the bill. 15% service charge was included in the bill, not really appreciated.",0
"In Joe's Shanghai, people eat on top of one another, in a noisy, ear-splitting maze of tables and customers. Joe's Shanghai really honed my understanding of the absurd, showing us that every dish could be cooked with the same sauce.",0
"it was just ok.  friends have raved about this place so i had high expectations.  although i've never had the real mccoy in shanghai, these dumplings were avg - not super tasty, however they were really soupy.  the green onion pancake was good - served w/ a sweet vs. savory flavored sauce, and the rice cake w/ cabbage & pork was good - greasy.  the black bean noodles weren't to my liking - i'd pass on this.  overall, i was disappointed, at the same time i'm glad i finally tried this place.",0
"I don't see how this place is any better than all the other chinese spots around Canal, but from what I was told the pork soup dumpling is their specialty and in my opinion it was ok.

The Shanghai noodles and scallion pancakes were nothing special. 

Maybe I need to order some other specialty dishes, but the 3 I ordered were ok.",0
"I feel bad that I live in NYC and am not a huge Chinese fan, but Joe's Shanghai? Ok, by me. First thing's first - be prepared to wait at both the Chinatown and midtown locations. The soup dumplings are all the rave here and they should be. They are good and CHEAP. Just little pillows of heaven. I've gotten a few other dishes here, but nothing comes even close to the dumplings. I could make a meal out of those alone!",0
"I've been hearing great things about the xiao long baos here for years but never had the opportunity to try them until recently. 

I'll start with the wait. We came on a Saturday evening hoping to get a table for two. As it turns out, so did everyone else. I disdain long lines, particularly when it comes to  restaurants because the food is almost never worth the wait but after years of rain-checking Joe's, I decided to man up. We took a seat ticket from one of the ladies working inside and asked her how long the wait would be, to which she informatively replied, ""I don't know."" Confused, we decided to stand aimlessly into the night not knowing whether we'd be called next or never (the number on the ticket does not correspond to the order of the wait list). All told, we waited about 1.5 hours before we got in. 

You're seated family style here so cozy up to the strangers next to you. (With everyone ordering the same things, this provides a great excuse to dip into thy neighbor's dumplings). We ordered an order each of the pork and the crab baos and decided to try the shanghai fried flat noodles and kung pao chicken as well. 

I've had soup dumplings many times in my life and these did not leave an impression on me. The best part about them was the dough. It was thin, but still chewy; really great texture. The filling was disappointing. The pork didn't have much flavor and there is very little meat. The crab was a bit better and I found it to be the more savory of the two. I guess you can't ask for much when one basket costs under $5 ($7 for the crab variety).

The noodles and chicken were mediocre. The noodles seemed to be stir fried in pure soy sauce with pork and cabbage. The chicken was decent but it needed to be spicier. 

Come for the above-average soup dumplings as it's cheap and will satiate your cravings. If there's a long line, go to one of the many other restaurants in Chinatown that serves soup dumplings. You won't be missing out on much.",0
"This place is a little over hype and popular. The line to get a table can be ridiculous, if I'm going to wait 30 minutes, the food better be freakin amazing. Sometimes this is New York, where dumb people wait a ridiculous long line at places like Shake Shack or Trader Joe's Union Square. The food is good but not great after going through the 30 minute wait. 

Service here can be garbage. I called a waiter for a check and he intentionally ignored me and continued to walk his way. My water and tea aren't getting filled when they need to be and the food can take a little longer to come out because there's so many people inside.

I've had better, there's too much soup in the xiao long bao/soup dumpling. The crab meat soup dumpling isn't that good, just stick with the classic pork. The only thing I really like here is the singapore pan fried noodle. That's really about it.",0
You would think with all of the reviews this place would be better. It's just ok...you do sit at large table with other people and it's busy so you feel super rushed the whole time. In my opinion this place is overrete,0
"If you want to have your dinner with a stranger at the same table, you can come here. Besides, there's one waiter's attitude is really poor. He seems wants to beat me when I asked him question coz the space is too loud. Furthermore, each dish here is a bit sweet except the xiao long bao.",0
"Decent, but overrated. I came for the famed xialongboa (steamed pork buns), which were just OK. While they were juicy, the juice was more fatty than ""brothy"" - and in several bites, they tasted like nothing but fat! Service was friendly, though, and the Singapore mai fun was fine. I'd consider returning with out-of-town friends - the restaurant was packed with tourists! - but I can't imagine Joe's satisfying any of my (semi-frequent) xialongboa cravings.",0
"OVERRATED. Having had XLB at several good places in Taiwan, including the original OG Ding Tai Fung location and other local places, it's hard to find anything worthy outside of the country. Even removing those from the discussion, either of the Din Tai Fung locations in Seattle, Dinesty in Vancouver, B.C., and other smaller places all do it better. Joe's Shanghai has been around forever, and have earned a reputation, but it's undeserved. The XLB here is pretty mediocre. Meat seems good quality and soup is a little bland but the skin is what really kills it. It's thick, they're ugly, and each basket arrive with at least 1 already broken and spilling out. Not much of a soup dumpling when there's no soup inside, is it? Bottomline, these are just so sloppy, and a real disappointment.",0
"It's a pretty basic restaurant . We had the 1/2 duck, noodles, and dumplings. Duck was salty and they serve it with salt on the side! Noodles had some nice big spinach on top which was great. The dumplings interior was very dense and couldn't really enjoy it.",0
"Decided to stop here mainly for their ""infamous soup dumplings"" and their house glazed crispy chicken. The soup dumplings were really BIG, flavorful and freshly made. On the other hand, their house crispy chicken was fair. Nothing spectacular at all. One thing we immediately noticed when the dish came out, was the pool of oil (canola) at the bottom of the dish. The sauce tasted very commercial and full of MSG! For the price of the meal ($40) we didn't think it was worth it and kept talking about how many delicious dishes we could have gotten had a e gone somewhere else. If you are looking to get great soup dumplings, and that's it I would recommend coming here, otherwise there are so many great mom and pop restaurants in the area where the food is BOMB.",0
"Located in the heart of Chinatown in NYC, Joe's Shanghai is one busy little restaurant.  During my visit to NYC this past weekend I had to checkout Joe's and try their Xiao Long Bao (dumplings with soup and pork filling).  We were fortunate to get a seat right away but don't expect any private seating, they only have a bunch of these huge round tables and they seat everyone together (so if you don't have a party of 8+ then expect to be seating with a bunch of strangers).  The dumplings on the other hand were a bit overrated in my opinion (even though the taste was above average I think I was expecting something AMAZING).  Growing up in socal and living in Norcal I have the opportunity to sample a variety of dumplings and just because these dumplings have soup in them didn't make them that much more special then what I've already tried here in Cali.  I'm glad I got a chance to try it but it was definitely overhyped.  If you're in the Chinatown area then definitely check it out but don't go out of your way to come here...",0
Overrated dumplings. Less clean and more crowded even on low Chinatown-calibrated standards. Also on the lower tier of Chinatown bathrooms; the innards and surrounding area smelled bad (granted it was summertime).,0
"My xia long bao review.

We only ordered the pork xia long bao.  I think that if you can't make the classic one right, then the other ones won't taste as good.

Way over hyped and the xia long bao didn't live up to its reputation.  It just didn't taste that great.",0
"I normally would not voluntarily go there since there are so many better restaurants in Chinatown.  However, I had a friend from out of town visiting and he wanted to go so I agreed.
This place is so overhyped and full of tourists.  Every night the line is insane outside and the line is managed by the rudest staff ever.  You ask them a question about the line and the wait and they totally dismiss you like you're invisible or you're speaking Jibberish to them.
Once you do get a table the waiters inside are equally rude.  Before you're done eating they already want to clear your dishes and throw the bill at you.  It's definitely not a place you can take your time to chew your food.
As for the food, the soup dumplings are indeed good with  nice thin skins and plenty of tasty soup and meat inside.  However, the rest of the food is mediocre at best and much more expensive than other restaurants in Chinatown.  
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.  Chinatown has lots of better eats and service even though Chinese restaurants are generally not known for their service.  Oh, and the nerve of the restaurant to automatically include a 15% tip on your final bill.  If it was up to me the service there deserves 1% tip.",0
Food was mediocre at best. The restaurant is small and dingy. They take tip from you and add it to the bill. Would not recommend this place at all.,0
Came here late on a Sunday night for dumplings and they were alright. Ordered the pan fried noodles and asked if they were crunchy (I honestly had no clue) and the server said no. Turns out they were definitely crunchy. Server wasn't really friendly but my friend got her dumplings so it was okay. Appreciated finding a table,0
"Tonight's dinner at Joe's Shanghai was the worst meal I can recall ever having in a NYC restaurant.  I've eaten there a few times since moving to NY in 1995.  I've never been impressed, but their following has brought me back over the years to give it a second, third, etc try.  Sure enough, on this rainy Wednesday night, there was a line outside for tables, so whatever it has going for it hasn't eased up.  But it sure isn't the food?   No fresh or zingy flavors, just glop covering limp, aging vegetables, phlegmy sauce covering mealy sea food, and a pork dish that tasted like it came out of a tin can years past it's expiration date.  I can honestly say I've had better Chinese food in coach on Cathay Pacific.  And I suspect I would have had a better meal dumpster dodging on Pell Street tonight.  I am sooo disappointed!",0
"Honestly, its a bit overrated. I mean the food is good, not going to lie. But the way everyone raves about the soup dumplings makes it seem as if its the greatest soup dumplings mankind has ever made.

The soup dumplings are good, a bit small, but good. Nothing too fancy. The sauce that came with it was a little strong for me, but everyone has their own preferences.

The restaurant was definitely cramped since its so popular. I was a bit disappointed that my friends and I had to situate ourselves in the same table as another couple. Kind of awkward and not too pleasant of an experience.

Their food in general is pretty good if you're looking for a more authentic Chinese food tasting experience. But don't be hyped up coming in about the soup dumplings or you may be disappointed.",0
"Just to give anyone interested in Joe's Shanghai a forewarning. This place has a C rating, but surprisingly this restaurant was packed. Not a seat left open.

The service is that of what you would expect in Chinatown. It's rough around the edges in regards to manners, but you should be used to that given that you've made it this far downtown. 

The soup dumplings are the only thing to get here. My friend and I rounded out the menu with the Soup Dumplings, a vegetable dish, a seafood dish, and a pork Dish. 

They were all just OK, nothing great to rave about. The Soup dumplings were great, but severely lacking something. I can't put my finger on what it was. 

15% gratuity is included and this place is cash only.",0
"Perhaps they're still working out the kinks, but my first experience left me with no craving to go back. Soup dumplings were very soggy. I also asked for no Pancake (which I was told was no problem) only to find, you know what,  in the dish. Also ordered Noodle, which was underwhelming. The Noodle was actually the best thing that came out of the kitchen (not what you'd expect from a place that has seafood bar in its title). The server was friendly but had no clue about the menu or the wine.",0
"This restaurant is extremely popular. I wasn't expecting such a long line out the door, but it moved fairly quickly. They are best known for their soup dumplings. I'd never had them before. These steamed dumplings are filled with pork and broth. They serve large portions.  I also tried the chive pancakes, which were simple but delicious. I highly recommend the General Tso's Chicken - perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  Their menu selection is extensive, so I am certain you will find something you enjoy. 

Overall - high 3",0
"Your'e coming here for the dumplings. That's it. You are not coming for ambience, service or your own table. You want to (carefully) shovel soup dumplings in your mouth and get out of there.

I am taking off two stars because they don't take reservations and the wait can be atrocious. Think 1h30 OUTSIDE during NYC winter. You have to be there to put your name down and then you wait. You stand in the cold as you watch other people, warm inside, sucking down these yummy soup filled dumplings and all you can do is hope you get called on next. But it takes a while.

If you want soup dumplings check it out. But be prepared to wait.",0
"I'm going to say it, not the best I've had. I liked the ease of ordering. Paid cash and waited outside for take out. Got the crab and pork soup dumplings as well as the fried pork dumplings. They were okay. I was most surprised by the dipping sauce they served with the pork dumplings, it was sweet and salty and paired nicely. The crab and pork soup dumplings though, that was an absolute no. We didn't have more then one each because the texture on the inside was rough to eat. 
Go to SF for good dumplings.",0
"Been going to Joe's for well over a year now for lunch. Always get the same thing, Chicken with peanuts in chili sauce. Today I ordered for the first time in a couple months and clearly they have a new cook or they are cheapening the dish. Instead of just chicken and peanuts, which is the way it has always been, now they are adding fillers like peppers to take up room and the sauce is very thin and lacks flavor. The dish is not appetizing anymore.",0
"Worst Chinese food ever. Long wait, deplorable service. When I complained my food was cold, waiter did nothing. DON'T GO!",0
"Food: 
I tried both just pork and crab n pork Xiao long bao. The skin is too thick, the broth was flavorful but oily. If I have to choose, I will order crab n pork one again, just because you can really taste the crab meat in it. Other dishes like stir fry rice cake or noodle was pretty good, but again, very oily. Cold dishes were inconsistently made. I mean, if you are lucky, you will get the tastier ones because they were marinated long enough; but if not, you will get the ones that weren't marinated long enough. I have gotten a cold chicken vermicelli that I can taste clogs of what i think is MSG. It was salt like texture but not salty, so must be MSG.  Yuk!!!!! But I do like their dessert. The red bean cookie taste great!!!!!

Service:
Not too bad but there are at least seven servers that just stand in a circle and chat right by my table. I guess I can't blame them, the restaurant is limited in space. But at least do not joke and laugh loudly when there's customers around!!!! BTW, they add in 15% tip to your bill, be aware of it!!!!!!!! And, this is a cash ONLY restaurant!!!!!!

this is a busy restaurant during lunch hours, do expect to wait if you have more than four people.",0

A disappointment. The soup dumplings weren't as good as ones I've had at other places for cheaper prices. Also had the kung pao chicken which was subpar at best.,0
"Joe's Shanghai is one of those restaurants you'll have to try when in Chinatown. I don't necessarily recommend this place for the atmosphere, the service, overall food, etc., but I do recommend it because of their soupy dumplings. The few times I have come here, there has always been a line outside - It's a tolerable length of waiting time though, and they will try to usher you in as quickly as possible. Although, after a long day of walking through Chinatown, this would probably be the last place I would want to be. It also has communal tables because it is that crowded. You will need to sit next to strangers. This is not a bad thing though, but I personally prefer my own seating space and more privacy with my guest(s). Going back to their soupy dumplings, it's delicious and costs only $5 for 8 of them. It's sufficient enough for a meal, and you may not need to order anything else. If you never tried a soupy dumpling, then all the more reason to check out Joe's Shanghai.",0
"I don't get what the deal is :) I couldn't eat the dumplings since there were no non-pork option. So I ordered seafood noodles which the waiter tried to explain to me to get the flat noodles vs. the pan fried noodles. And so I got convinced. Anyway the noodles were fine, nothing spectacular and also at a price point of $17.xx which honestly for the experience of the restaurant is super high. 
The place is old and dingy, crowded, you seat communally and the dinnerware is old too. So, why am I supposed to be excited about spending $21.37 on a plate of seafood noodles that aren't super amazing?",0
"I think the food is overrated. It was not worth standing in the cold outside waiting for you to be called. The place crams customers in until you're elbow to elbow with them.

We waited an hour to be called and when they did, we sat at the back, with other people sitting side by side. Some people may like that, I however did not. 
The water came in a cup where the server touched the rim where your lips touch- who knows, they may very well put their finger in it too. The service was so slow. You literally have to keep flagging them and even then, they put their pointer up to tell you to wait. We weren't able to order after sitting until 30 minutes. We ordered the soup dumplings and crunchy noodle with seafood. It came after 10 minutes. The soup dumpling was okay. Just okay. I think we were better off to the other soup dumpling place, at least I know to never go to these disgusting Joe's Shanghai restaurants.

Going to the back where the bathroom takes the icing to the cake. It was awful, it reeked of death that day there for who knows how long. Then I looked at the floor and it's just disgusting as you renter the bathroom, it was a horror movie. It was so gross I literally wanted to cry because I DID NOT want to touch Anything but I really needed to pee. I got a scratch as this guy passed by me with a trash bag as he just finished cleaning the bathroom, I was scratched by something and I am praying I didn't catch anything.",0
"Maybe it was because my friend and I went right before closing. Maybe the cooks were ready to go home and call it a night. I dunno. But I don't really have anything good to say about this place.

I agree with the other reviewers who say that better, or at least equally good, soup dumplings can be had at many other restaurants. I recommend Shanghai Cafe on Mott Street, just north of Canal. There, they serve the soup dumplings with a yummy ginger-soy dipping sauce. 

The soup dumplings here didn't live up to all the hype, and the other dishes were ordered were just so-so. I wouldn't go back.",0
"On my way in I was reminded by my fiancé that Yelp is not a good barometer for real Asian food... truer words were never spoken. This place would be palatable, I'm sure, for some reason who hasn't been to any of the infinitely better places within a stones throw of this joint. To make a long story short, Joe's is overpriced and not very good. Good luck finding an Asian person actually dining there.",0
"Had the Xiao Long Bao with the crab meat filling which I didn't really like . I didn't like the fishy taste to it . The XLB had a good amount of soup in it though . Maybe we should have opted for the pork XLB instead ... oh wells , there's always next time . In addition to their XLB , we also had their  pork dumplings which didn't taste that great . The filling tasted alright but the wrapper of the dumpling didn't taste that good . Last but not the least , we had their Shanghai stir-fried noodles which were really good ... one of the best I've ever had . It was nice and flavorful ... seasoned and stir-fried perfectly .",0
"I am only giving 2-stars because the food was decent, by the way this is not a full dim sum restaurant, they do not have cha siu bao- only a few dim sum items with the rest of the menu American Chinese.

We arrived at 1 PM and I put my name in for 6 people. After receiving a text 2 minutes later that there will be 2 more of us joining, I went up to the hostess and explained that we are now a party of 8 and she circled our reservation on her clipboard, which I figured was her way of noting this change.

After the 30+ minute wait for our table (which is fine) we are then brought to a table that only seated 6, and told we could not add chairs and would have to wait 10-15 more minutes for a larger table, and I was told I was wrong and told her 6. After mentioning she even circled our reservation she denied it and then walked away. I would say you get better service at a McDonalds's connected to a truck stop but I think that would be degrading to the McDonald's.

After being seated, the waiter barked ""Appetizers and only took appetizer orders then disappeared and continued this with each course. I understand they are a very busy place but if you have to implement a mandatory 15% gratuity to every check, that shows how POOR your service is.

Very nasty hostess & rude staff.

Chinatown offers HUNDREDS of other places you can dine that are not TOURIST TRAPS. We got beers while we were waiting across the street and they had a very similar menu, sweet staff and took credit cards. In a city full of amazing restaurants, don't follow the crowds, you can find equally amazing places without all the overinflated reviews and write-ups.",0
"This place was a huge disappointment. I've been several times before and I expected to sit with strangers and have rushed service, but the outdid themselves this time.

We started with the scallion pancakes and then followed with 2 orders of pork soup dumplings and 2 orders of crab-pork soup dumplings. We ordered long before our neighbors, but they just presented us with 1 order of pork soup dumplings while our neighbors got 2 orders of crab soup dumplings they did not order. I asked the waiter if it was ours, but he said our order was coming. We finished our order and the waiter came over and said that's all right? I said NO, we still have 3 orders left. His English was so poor, I wasted about 5 minutes trying to explain to him I only got 1 order of soup dumplings so far. He disagreed with me and tried to make me pay for 4 orders when we only got 1. My neighbor had an allergic reaction to the crab because he thought it was pork. And that's when the very intelligent server realized that he gave them the wrong order he just took it away half eaten and gave them a free serving of soup dumplings too trying to make it up to them.

I will be going elsewhere for soup dumplings from now on. I think it was a huge violation to serve my neighbor something is is allergic to.",0
"Very very very overrated. 
1) The lines are incredibly long.
2) The food is really oily.
3) + bland.

Save your time and go elsewhere. There's plenty of other great restaurants for soup dumplings + Chinese food!",0
"Over hyped. Average at best. The only good thing was the soup dumplings. Scallion pancakes were looking more like fried pancakes. 
Waiting staff was slow and extremely un courteous. I fail to understand the 4 star plus rating.",0
"I have never written a review on Yelp before, but after eating at Joe's Shanghai last night, I felt compelled to set the record straight.  Bottom line:  The food here is horrible.  I had high expectations coming in after seeing a four star rating on Yelp with 1000+ reviews, but was utterly and completely underwhelmed.

Could not for the life of me understand the hype about the dumplings.  They are gross and horrible.  The whole fish is fishy and horrible.. the service, decor, everything - all horrible.  Best part of the meal:  the orange slices that come with the check.

Not even worthy of half a star.",0
"Ever walked into an ethnic restaurant expecting to see a bunch of the same ethnicity dining there?  Lets just say i was surprised to see the absent asian folks at the joint.

The xiao long baos here were pretty good, the soup in the bun was piping hot and oh so savory! it's a great treat on any cold day.  

I didn't enjoy the crab meat one as much, the crab butter was a bit too strong for my liking.

I mean this place ain't bad, but i was expecting to see more of my fellow asian crowd.  You know what they say, good food brings in the crowd!",0
"This is a ""get in, get the f out"" type of spot where you're seated amongst strangers.  The service is subpar, the food is pretty good and the hustle and bustle of chinatown and new york city in general become apparent in this very busy restaurant.  Expect a wait for 10-20 min to be seated during busy hours but its definitely worth the adventure.

You should know 3 things: 

First off -- Know that its ""CASH ONLY"" so don't forget to bring some fresh dollar bills.  They have an ATM right outside but it probably comes with a heavy cost. 

Secondly-- whatever you think it enough for 1 person is probably good for two people.  If you get what you perceive to be ""2 entrees"" you will not be able to finish all of the food --seriously, its a ton.

Thirdly -- its an authentic Chinese restaurant, get something different --try the duck, maybe get some soup dumplings amongst other things. Live a little and eat something other than orange chicken -_-  yes, I'm judging you. lol",0
"Maybe the wait heightened my expectations too much, but every dish I had was just okay, including the soup dumplings.

If the line looks short and you have an intense craving for soup dumplings, why not stop by. But otherwise, don't waste your time, you can find much better Chinese food around the corner.",0
"Avoid it at night or on weekends nights for you will be stuck in the streets waiting for a seat,  be crammed with strangers at a table, have to deal with cranky servers and wait forever for the food.
But,  it is one of the places with the better soup dumpling outside of Shanghai. How ever as one reviewer pointed once you know what the ingredients are you might not be raving about the dumplings and scallion pancakes (my old man makes them at home). It also doesn't help that I like to eat things fast, and no matter how many times I tell myself you will regret it, I'll bite into one of the bombs and burn the daylights out of my mouth.",0
"The xiao long bao is hugeeeeeeeee so don't over order. It is not bad but if you are more used to the more refined taste, you are in the wrong place. Food in general is very oily and with huge portion. I still couldn't believe this place has the highest rating on Yelp for Chinese cuisine in NYC Chinatown.",0
"Super crowded, massive lines, curt service staff are downsides. But, the food is good and pretty cheap. The portions are big for noodle bowls and other non-appetizer things, so I'm very satisfied with. However, plenty of other places can be found in chinatown that are smaller and equally yummy! That may have an equal lack of service, but are at least a bit less crowded and are in fact even cheaper. 

ALSO this isn't actually a dim sum place, I hate that I was tricked by yelp the first time I went here. They don't consider themselves a dim sum place either. There are appetizers but there aren't that many options - not great especially if you want to be adventurous.",0
Bed servers ever. The food not really good. My family when there with 4 people and that was our first time and we took time look at menu. The waiter was rushing us. I never go there again.,0
"I have been sick from there food for 12 days and had to take antibiotics from such bad bacteria from eating this disgusting shit!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Worth the hype? Definitely not. Overpriced food, little portions, soup dumplings not even warm. I've had better soup dumplings. 

There's so many more restaurants in Chinatown that taste delicious, worth the wait, and give decent portions. 

I will not be coming back.",0
Visiting a friend in the wonderful city of New York and had to make our way to Chinatown. Letting the power of yelp and hunger of our stomaches lead us here!  We waited what felt like forever (45+Mins) to finally be seated with our new family (strangers). What has me amazed is while reviewing my fellow yelpers I don't recall the system they use to sit you down at this place being mentioned... however all in all it was a fun experience and the food was good. The  (pork) soup dumplings are a must and (chicken) lo mein was authentic and so yummy! As for anything else I'm not won over...  the fried rice was ohhkayyy. I've had better and we tried one other dish that was not liked by ANY of the girls...,0
"overrated soup buns. they weren't even plump. they looked like ""saggy boobs"" to quote my date. skimping out on soup in soup dumplings and bad presentation makes me hesitant on going back ! they would have gotten two stars, but the flavor of the pork/crab filling was really good. one more star for them.",0
Food is not clean bruh quality is bad after I eat i went home and have diarrhea for 2 days,0
"*Still Cash Only*

I've been back to Joe's a few times in person and their XLB always hits the spot whenever I'm having a fix.

*WAIT*
We came early on a weekday and there was no wait.   Otherwise, you'll need to put your name with the hostess who will give you a number. 

*FOOD*
The pork meat soup dumplings are always plump and flavorful (11.95 for 8 pieces).   We also ordered the seafood pan fried crispy noodles which was very good, and felt the seafood portions were reasonable.  Also ordered the fried dumplings (8 pieces) but would skip these and save more room to try other dishes as the dumplings were pretty lackluster.  It was overly greasy and the skin was very thick.

*SERVICE*
Service was standard -- they do add an automatic 18% service charge no matter how large your party is.  

Still a good place to get soup dumplings, but everything else seems average.",0
"Joe Shanghai are you really worth the wait? When you are really looking for somewhere for Shanghainese regardless of the wait or not. 

This is one of those places you can't bring your first day date to, extremely noisy and crowded here (worst than Shanghai Cafe). I personally came to eat and be able to chit chat with buddies but we just quickly ate and found another place.

I waited 45 minutes and the food was just okay. In Chinatown I would prefer to get the Xiao Long Bao from Shanghai cafe even though I think it is good but not great. Nothing is compare to Flushing's Xiao Long Baos or Shanghai of course. The fried noodles is average. I don't think this would be worth my time.",0
"After hearing and reading such rave reviews about this place I went to check it out as I happened to be in the area.

What's up with the service? 0 stars. It was the middle of the afternoon and we sat down to get some xiao long bao as a snack. Pretty good deal for 8 dumplings at $4.65. However, this is all we (3 of us, only 2 ate) ordered and the waiter glared at us and shouted, ""That's it?!?!"" The rude treatment continued at the end of the meal when he took our plates, gave us our bill, and watched us leave with the same intense, angry glare. SO WHAT IF OUR BILL WAS $5.05 hahaha the service you provided was rubbish and we left feeling really weird. Watching the other waiters in the restaurant, most other tables were getting similar service from disgruntled, short tempered Chinese waiters.

Dishes and utensils all came crusted with old food. Yuck. This was before we ordered. RINSING DISHES UNDER RUNNING WATER IS NOT A PROPER CLEANING METHOD!

So, honestly, what is everyone's obsession with these xiao long bao? They are not that good! They are too large, the skin is too thick, the flavor is inconsistent, I could go on... Maybe the quality has gone down as this place as gotten much rave review and attention that is has become somewhat of a tourist trap?

I was considering ordering another dish, but I think their main draw is cheap xiao long bao, while all other Chinese courses are jacked up in price.

I haven't been down to Chinatown since I ate at Grand Harmony last August. 0 for 2, there is not much draw in making me come back to this neighborhood. I am Chinese and love Chinese food too! This just makes me miss San Francisco and Oakland Chinatown that much more...",0
I came here for trying out their pecking duck. It was decent in tasting. There is not much flavor and dry but the meat was cooked perfectly. I would rather try the soup dumplings next time. The Shanghai rice was very flavorful.,0
"Average quality food, no lunch menu visible. $14 for lemon chicken and white steamed rice - not a one $ price by any means, more like $$. Try other $$ places instead that are nicer inside",0
"don't bother coming here if you are a vegetarian.  

i imagine the soup dumplings are amazing.  my friends made deporable slurping noises as they ate them.  they said really charming things like, ""mmmm, this is the best soup dumpling i've ever had.  oh wow, this is so good.""

the tofu soup i ordered had tiny bits of chicken (or pork?) in it.  ugggh.",0
"Chose this place as it was the only place in Chinatown with over 4,000 reviews and four starts.  Nothing special but nothing bad so it does not deserve four stars, just average Chinese-style fast food.  Very busy and you will wait (even if you get there early) and it's communcal seating.  The place is very busy so it's production style: order, get your food, eat it and that's it.  Servers are friendly but hurried.",0
"What's super annoying is it's cash only BUT they add tip and tax to the bill. Otherwise would have given 3 stars. 

Soup dumplings were ok/average. The wrapper is too thick although they had plenty of liquid inside. Would like them more if we had never been to din tai fung (Still the best combo of size/wrapper/liquid).",0
"Ate here today for lunch. Of course, the soup dumplings are delicious but not worth the total lack of customer service. We also, ordered the crispy beef and Shanghai thick noodles. The crispy beef was crispy flour bits with almost no beef. The Shanghai thick noodles came out only partially covered with the sauce as if it were too much trouble to give them another toss in the pan before putting them on the plate. 

The servers give you little or no attention. And seem to congregate in the back talking amongst themselves. 

Two stars for the soup dumplings only.",0
"Our family of four just had dinner here on Saturday March 30, 2024.  We waited over half an hour for a table, then a mediocre dinner. About an hour after finishing, the stomach troubles began. My wife and I both had bad diarrhea upon returning to our hotel. One daughter vomited a little after that. The other daughter woke up at about midnight and vomited. Then the first daughter had another vomit/diarrhea combo about an hour after the first episode. My wife then repeated a diarrhea episode and I followed up with a violent vomit. I'm impressed that we were able to time our individual attacks while sharing one hotel bathroom. 

Going to guess that it was probably the beef/broccoli and/or the crispy noodles with beef, since those are the two we all shared. I'll be surprised if this is the only review of this type for that night. 

On the positive side, the service was good.",0
Good old school food. Cash Only is an issue for me anymore or would have rated higher,0
"Bad service. Order dish for takeout after dinner, and packed leftovers. Back home checked only leftovers, missing dish. The bill did charge $20.80 for takeout dish.",0
"It is quite an experience that I feel lucky to have been able to witness.  The place has such a unique aspect to it, from the no reservations, long wait times, carpeted floors, and communal seating, it is definitely not something you experience on a regular basis.

The service is extremely detached and unfriendly.  They serve one purpose, and that is to bring you food, nothing else.  You can easily sit and be finished with your meal in under an hour.  Living in NYC I already live a hectic lifestyle, so personally I enjoy the experience of dining out, almost as much as I enjoy the food itself.

The food itself was 4-stars.  That kitchen cranks out so many orders that it lacks that same personalized feeling as previously mentioned.  Overall it was good, but with all the other factors to consider here, I am not sure that it was so good it would be worth a return trip.  

I suggest you try it once to cross it off your NYC food list, but you will likely be tempted to make excuses to not go the next time someone suggests it.  Manhattan really has such great food establishments, you don't need to visit the same place twice unless you really wanted to, and this one hasn't made a comeback yet.",0
"Of course we came to this place because everyone on Yelp raves about it and heard about it from people who heard about it from people.  

For the most part, I think a lot of ""well-rated"" places can be somewhat overhyped, but generally are worth a try. 

We were so looking forward to this place, but it was awful.  Service was fine. People were kind, place looked nice.  Overall, the food was just not flavorful. 

However, the food was sorry. The xiao long bao (soup dumplings) everyone talks about were not good.  You could tell they were from frozen. The skin was dry and didn't have the right chew or texture a good, authentic xiao should have. 

We also ordered a noodle soup, and the wide noodles (which was the best of everything, but still wasn't great). The noodle soup was SO bland we couldn't even finish it.  Everything was bland.  Even with the vinegar and hot spice the food itself wasn't flavorful. 

If I wasn't with a friend who said the food was bland first, I would have thought I was imagining the badness of this food. 

It was so bad my friend literally said ""Do you think this is bland because we both caught Covid and don't know it?""  It was not of course. 

Anyway. Everything here lacked flavor. I really believe that people just hype other people up who write great reviews and it just keeps going farther. No way this food is actually great.",0
"If you come here, you MUST try their soup dumplings. The fried beef isn't very good. It's dry and hard. We didn't end up finishing that dish. The other dishes were greasy too. We came here earlier at around 5:30 to avoid the wait but we still had to wait around 20-30 mins. I came with a party of 9 and they didn't have a table big enough so we had to split up.  The service was ok. We were rushed but that was only because so many people were waiting. But the waiters were friendly.",0
definitely not Din Tai Fung quality. go to Nan Xiang in Flushing!!,0
"A good place for soup dumplings. You know it's authentic because of the curt service and grimy environment. It's good for a quick and dirty meal. I personally don't really care for soup dumplings because the soup tastes so fatty and gelatinous, but I think they're one of the better ones.",0
"found this place on yelp. had to try their dumplings which i thought were pretty good. i wish they had more of a selection of dumplings. we ordered 8 and it was enough for two ppl. we also ordered a bowl of beef noodle soup. that wasn't so good. noodles were overcooked and soggy. meat was ok, but nothing special. good thing lunch came out to $11. ding ding. =)",0
"Waited about 30 minutes. Once inside, service was pretty quick. They've got it down to get people out quickly. Food was good but nothing special. Definitely a place for tourists.",0
"So many pros here. The service was great, the setting was delightful and the wait staff was on point. But how expensive.. would not mind paying this price if dumplings where fresh and tasty authentic dumplings but there Not.",0
"Ugh the only good thing here was the chow fun fried rice. Hated how big the XLB were and how thick the dumpling wrapper was. The fried dumpling was so bland. The Peking duck was okay- had way too many fatty pieces , but where was the fluffy bao buns that come with it??? Instead it was a tortilla??? Not worth the hype.",0
"Horrible General Tso's chicken dish. My portion was mostly greasy dough with miniscule pieces of meat. Small portion. The scallion pancake appetizer had very scant scallions, also mostly deep-fried dough. Kitchen help sneezes and wipe nose then handle your food. They call themselves Joe's Ginger now. I'm not going back.",0
"Dumplings where ok and the noodles were pretty good. The place seems a little dirty and the service is not that great. Doubt that I'll ever come back. BTW, this is cash only but there is a Chase a block away.",0
"I was expecting some quality Xiao long bao today but what I got was a platter full of SHIT.  Been dying to come here for the longest because everytime I walk by here, there is always a got damm line. 

Friend and I came here for a late lunch and even though we came at an off hour after the lunch rush, the quality of the food was beyond deplorable. Moreover, the wait staff's hospitality resembled a mental hospital ward in Uganda. BEYOND disgusted. 

Ordered the usual, crab meat with pork stuffed xiao long bao, a fried quail, and a rice cake dish with beef, along with some scallion pancakes. 

The xiao long bao even though came out in a timely matter, the presentation was beyond horrendous because the dumplings looked like they have been cooked 6 times and the soup inside of it looked like they were ready to burst. The scallion pancakes also were really bad because it was not even crispy nor flavorful. AKA i was eating fried cardboard. 

The fried quail looked pretty decent even though it was 3.25 but every thing was the pits. The rice cake dish tasted more like grease fried rice cake because it was overly greasy. It looked like they fried the rice cakes in lard and then they sauteed the beef in pork fat and then mixed it together to make it shanghai style beef rice cake. Despicable. 

The only highlight of this meal was actually the waitstaff. Every 2 minutes they would come over and ask you whether you were done with this dish or whether or not you want something. It's like eating in prison no offense because they were like the KGB and we ( patrons) were the prisoners. Furthermore, they were also laughing at the foreigners who were clueless on what to order, which is not a good idea when 94 percent of the clientele here is NON Chinese. To sum it up   they just have no fucking manners. Please Mr. Joe, tell your waitstaff to take Mannerisms 101. It's important for a successful restaurant. Thank you.",0
"I have been to Joe's a couple of times. My first experience (non holiday period) was amazing. The dumplings were delicious and so were the Dan Dan Noodles and the Kung Pao chicken.

I recently visited it again ( during the holiday period ) and the food was not the only thing bad, the service was poor as well. Leave alone order arriving on time one had to wait for refilling water as well. The food quality did not help. The dumplings and Kung Pao were the only saving grace. The pork fired rice had uncooked onions and the chicken Hot-and Sour soup was a bowl of pepper.

This place has been on my Yelp list for Asian food in New York but definitely am not doing it again during the Holiday season",0
This new location of joes Shanghai is not good to be honestly. I have give it two chances and the the is not as same as the joes Shanghai for the old location. I believe the chef are new or the receipt are different. The food does not compare to the pervious location what so ever. I am so disappointed and annoyed. It's not flavorful. These ma fu tofu needs to be flavorful and spicy. It's sweet and not season.,0
"Yuck Yuck Yuck- Maybe the dumplings are good but the food is nasty and they have a ""C"" rating. I wish i would have know that before i went but i had no idea because all the reviews on Yelp and when you get there and talk to the people are about the dumplings - Lastly the staff is rude!!!",0
Honestly this place is really overrated. The soup dumplings are decent but I'm pretty sure they made me shit my pants the following day. Skip it.,0
"When it comes to cleanliness, well this place is not exactly clean.  I always judge a place by how clean the bathroom is and as you can imagine this place needs the bathroom police..Yes the food is good but the lack of cleanliness for their restrooms leads me to believe their staff is not following sanitation standards.  The waitstaff lacked engagement to guide me through the menu and yes I am sorry I am not Asian, but if its any consolation I love Asian food.  Perhaps next time I visit, i will bring Asian friends to see if the service is better. Long wait for a table so be prepared to wait.
I had the scallion pancake, rice noodles with vegetables with garlic sauce.  The food was very tasty..I did love the XLB fresh and tasty.  Probably the best  I had in queens.",0
"Another restaurant still thriving on its fame from 20 years ago. 
Xlb thickest skin in town,  soup inside was so bland. 
Noodle soup so bland had to pour soy sauce and vinegar. 
Service was rude as usual.  
Never again.",0
"Great dumplings and fast service.  Always  a short wait, but worth the wait.  A bit pricey for flushing, cash only  and kid friendly",0
"The food here is pretty good, but it's definitely overrated.  

The soup dumplings aren't mind-blowing if you've already had legit soup dumplings.  I'm from Philly, and both Dim Sum Garden and Sakura's soup dumplings are on par with what Joe's had to offer.  The difference among them?  Joe's Shanghai crams as many tables as possible and you're forced to share tables with other people... Oh, and this is lunch on a Friday when most people should be working.  Weekend lines would not be worth the wait.",0
"Delicious soup dumplings, average dishes. I found the pork soup dumplings to be more tasty than the crab-pork soup dumplings.",0
"Wow.  Communal tables at its best.  Or worst?  Maybe you'll meet a friend from sitting here.

Packed, but we got seated quickly.  We ordered what was circled on the menu-the Shanghai noodles and dumplings-they were super greasy, so watch out for that.  But, they were tasty and cheap.  There's gotta be a balance somehow.",0
"Our friend told us the soup dumpling was great, so we tried the crab meat one and it was alright, my friend said that the pork one would've been better, but my bf and I didn't know at that time. Other than that the Singapore rice noodles were yummy, and the roasted duck was good as well.",0
"18% automatic service fee for a party of any size.

Food was mid, not bad but not good either. Overpriced for what it is. You can find better food elsewhere for cheaper.

Bathrooms are located a floor below. You have to walk down stairs.",0
"I have the distinct impression that during the Covid crisis they are saving food longer than they should, and perhaps preparing in bulk and serving for a few days.   I had to throw out almost everything delivered to me.  It was just on the brink of inedible.",0
"Let's start with the atmosphere, I know it's dim sum but I appreciate my own table. If you come here with less than 3 people odds are you're going to be seated with up to 2 other groups of people. Also good luck trying to have a conversation with the people seated next to you, it's far too loud to even hear yourself speak. Let me not forget the fact that I had to worry about poking the person next to me with my chopstick due the fact that so many of us were stuffed into 1 table and lacked spaced between us. Now to the food, I understand people come here for the soup dumplings but I don't believe one dish should make a restaurant, therefore we started our meal with the scallion pancake. As soon as the pancake hit our table the aroma of old oil filled our nostrils, and once we tasted it we could confirm it. Disappointed with the appetizer I decided to order General Tso, since any restaurant worth its weight in salt could cook a decent General Tso. Alas I was left disappointing, the sauce was mediocre while the chicken simply terrible and exceedingly dry, it resembled stale bread rolls with sauce poured over. I couldn't leave fast enough, the hype was over exaggerated.",0
"We decided to wait the 45 mins for soup dumplings on a Saturday at 6:30pm. It was just two of us, but we were like this MUST be the best place ever because the crowd waiting spilled out in the street probably 30-40 people... SO here is my honest opinion:

1.) Dont come for the experience and service. The hostess is pretty loud and rude, but was probably tired and hot from yelling outside to the crowd waiting. She was quite irritable. Its so crowded inside, the waiter can just take orders but can't really hear your questions nor explain the food options. You just have to order and try it out.

2.) CASH ONLY. Yep, they should probably tell you that when you first start to wait for a table. The girls next to us skipped out on paying because they had no cash. They literally ran out the restaurant. Just terrible.

3.) Bathrooms are GROSS. Bring your own toliet tissue if you must and hand sanitizer.

4.) We ordered crab and pork dumplings, fried spring rolls, and shrimp fried rice- $35. All 5/10. Shanghai cafe is the bomb and it's unfortunately closed at the moment I believe. I would say its worth a 15-20min wait but if you're starving like I was, I would never wait that long there again. Sorry *shrugs",0
"Hai okay-la. I grew up eating soup dumplings in Taipei and SoCal so I am never thoroughly impressed with Joe's. But when I have a craving, it is adequate. For me, it's not worth the wait. You should just go to Joe's Ginger a couple of doors down.",0
Good food horrible service. The staff wouldnt speak or acknowledge anyone that wasn't of Asian decent. And yes they speak English. Wasn't expecting that from such a popular restaurant that has tourist come in daily.,0
"We arrived at 9 pm on a Saturday night and waited approximately 20 minutes before we were sat at a table where we had to split a table. 

We ordered quite a few items and everything arrived quickly. The servers are quick and quite in a rude type of fashion like they hate working there

The dumplings have a good skin thickness but on the thicker side i tried. The meat inside was overpowered by the saltiness of soy sauce. Dumplings should just be sweet and taste like the filling

We had the spicy beef tension noodle soup. The flavor was good but not spicy at all. Such a disappointment

The green onion pan cake was thick but flavorful

I've had much better shanghai food in California but only this in New York. The food was overall just ok and I don't think I will visit this place if I visit New York again",0
"Ok Dumplings. I mean for juicy pork buns they are pretty good - not the best I've had, but not too shabby either. Lots of midwestern tourists not sure what to do (communal seating OMG! WTF!) this family of five we were sitting with kept trying to order General Tso's chicken and the waiter kept saying - NO! Dumpings! - but they didn't understand. They then ordered the dumplings (because my brother and I suggested them) and proceeded to melt their faces with them (we failed ot warn them that you have to drain the hot juice from them before eating). It was kind of a tragic comic experience.
Didn't try anything else but the dumplings. They definitely wanted us in and out of there.",0
Ugh not exellent we ate in the one in NYC and the waiters got takeout. I would not reccomend this resuraunt,0
"Okay well I'm a little confused as to how many stars to give so I'm gonna go with 2, and here's why.
The food? OUTSTANDING!
The service? NONEXISTENT! 
And it's BOTH that make for a good restaurant.
I read the reviews and the pork soup dumplings didn't seem to ever disappoint. Oh wow were they good. I honestly could have eaten 20 of them by myself. I also ordered the Shanghai Flat noodles. They were probably the best I've ever had. The food, as I said, was excellent.
My mom and I were the first guests of the day. We walked in RIIIIGHT at 11 am when they open. Now I understand that when you walk into a restaurant right as it opens, you can sometimes catch a staff off-guard. I assure you this wasn't the case. After being quite rudely told where I could sit, we ordered our food. We received our food in a timely fashion but I guess so did the staff on duty, because the three employees on duty were sitting at a table across the way from us, enjoying their lunch. Apparently enjoying it enough to NOT provide service to their ONLY guests at the time. No refills, no check back, I had to ask for the check.... No service at all. 
The icing on the cake... After I cashed out, one of the  employees walked up to me as I was leaving to make sure I left a tip for ""service"". Yeah that actually happened. 
I'll probably never give these fools business again. No matter how amazing I thought the food was.",0
"Amazing soup dumplings, terrible service. Was seated at a table with 7 other strangers (talk about awkward!) and the waiter was practically shouting at me. He also would clear our plates without asking or before we were even finished.",0
"Oh my gosh when I came here I was really looking forward to having some of ""the best soup dumplings in Chinatown"" as deemed by multiple sources. I am currently reviewing and rating for 3 stars until I go again next time so I may update this in the future. My order consisted of the crabmeat & pork soup dumplings, regular pork soup dumplings, eggplant in garlic sauce, and a side of rice. My dumplings came out very hot and tasty but over cooked and they became dry when they got to my table. The eggplant and garlic sauce dish was also very hot and tasty, but lacked that Shanghainese spice and kick I am accustomed to. I suppose it's become a very Americanized establishment to better suit a wider range of patrons. It's great that the waiters all speak English, are very quick, easy to flag down, and check up on you often. The place is cash only, a little inconvenient but it keeps the prices low. The bathroom is also decent compared to some other bathrooms in Chinatown, but would appreciate it if they were better kept. Also there is no hook on the door for a coat and bag (I was heading out with my belongings and I had all my things with me so it's important to have a hook to use lol). I really enjoyed the service, temperature of the food, and the flavors of the food however I think it could do with some adjusting. So 3 stars will be my rating for this experience until next time!",0
"Check your bill before you leave.

We got the XLB ($5.95), Scallion Pancake ($2.95), Shanghai Fried Flat Noodle ($8.95) and seasonal veggies (market price), and somehow the bill with tax and tip was $39.33.  

That means our seasonal veggies were $15 or somewhere there, or that these guys scammed us.  

And they rushed us out, standing and staring at us until we left.  It was very stressful, and that's why we saw a total and put down $40, and they had the audacity to ask if we wanted change.  HELL yes, if you already put 15% on my bill, I should get my change.  You pretty much are asking if I'd like to tip more than 15% for your bad service.  They should automatically give me the change

Btw - the Shanghai Fried Flat Noodles weren't flat - they were udon-like.

And some girls at our communal table put down short of 50 cents, and the waiter told them it wasn't enough.  Are you serious?  If you include tip, and tip is OPTIONAL, then they should be able to be short the 50 cents.

I'm just so unhappy with this experience.  But a learning experience it was.

I'll only be back for the XLB, lesson learned.",0
"Soup dumplings are always a go to - big, delicious soup, and great temperature.

We also got the seafood pan fried noodles, that gets a 1-2 stars ( so this averages to 3). The noddles had a weird flowery aftertaste. Also the seafood that came with it was:
 - 1 squid part
- 2 shrimps
- 1 scallop
And some light vegetables. Do not get this here. It was bland and lacking in every area!",0
"My review in one sentence:

Shanghai Cafe makes a better soupy dumpling. 

In the words of Forrest Gump, "" ... and that's all I have to say about that.""",0
"Well like they all say, this place is known for their Xiao long bao. We came here during the winter storm Jonas and trecked the windy streets for dinner at this place. This also happened to be one of the only places open during the storm. We were seated promptly, but had to share the table with two other parties. They asked us three times within a span of 7 minutes if we were ready to order. No. I'm not ready to order 

We ended up ordering two pork and two pork and crab Xiao long bao. We also got chicken pan fried noodles. Everything was delicious, and this was definitely the best soup dumplings I've had. 

I asked for water three times. I didn't get water during my meal. They kept on pressuring us to see if we were done, even if there was no line waiting to eat.",0
"I really wanted to like it more than I did. It is a solid American Chinese restaurant and the food is similar to any take out you'd get in many, if not most, American cities. Unfortunately, that's not quite what we were looking for. The overall rating was quite good and there was a huge line to get in, so we thought that would be a good sign. The ambiance was casual, which was what we wanted. And the food was good, it just wasn't great. And for about $120.00/couple (for food and one beer), I really wanted it to be better. The one real negative point was our waiter. The hostess seated us with menus and he literally followed her to our table and asked if we were ready to order. We asked for a minute to look at the menu and he appeared annoyed and came back every minute until we were ready to order. He was very unfriendly and not familiar with the menu. It was a shame because the other waiters seemed friendly. I think I would have found the price to be a little more justified if the service had been better. All in all it was a fine, but not memorable, experience.",0
"Came in to no line (which I'm told is rare). The 2 of us were seated at a table of 8 but luckily friendly people. We ordered pork dumplings and fried noodle. Way too much food for 2. The price was decent but I felt you there were better options nearby from a pricing perspective. 

The dumplings were good. I had in my mind they would be excellent and maybe my expectations were too high. 

The fried noodle was average and there was plenty of it. It comes out hot and freshly cooked.   

Overall a good experience but I think I had the bar set too high.",0
"If you've ever been to din tai fung, Joe's will disappoint. But I fear din tai fung is the industry standard and everyone else is fighting for second. I can't speak to any of the dishes here other than the xiao long bao which Joe's is known for and the only dish I ordered. Xiao long bao are soup dumplings, one of only a handful of items I can order in Chinese and one of my favorite foods in life that I openly seek when traveling. The line is long; as in 45 minutes to an hour in off hours like 330pm. The soup dumplings are good, but they skin is too thick and the meat filling is under seasoned and the broth while maintaining a tastiness that coats your lips, lacks depth and richness in flavor. Worth a trip for locals, soup dumpling first timers or frequent NYC travelers.",0
"I was really craving some Chinese food last night. I tried calling WoHop but they close so early these days, 9:00pm. So I decided to try Joe's Shanghai. I remembered that they were good from their old days at their old location on Bayard street so I decided to try their new location on Bowery. 

I ordered a very basic dish of chicken fried rice and their soup dumplings for take out. As I started to unpack their food I realized that they did not included any soy sauce or sweet and sour sauce or mustard sauce. So what the heck I'll just eat the chicken fried rice plain without any sauces. Once I started eating it I noticed that it tasted pretty plain. Then I noticed that there were parts of the rice it that were really salty and crunchy. I had to pick these salty crunchy bits out of my mouth  because It was nasty, I was eating little clumps of dried salt. It was like the cook had done a half ass job and thrown in some MSG at the last moment but it hadn't dissolved into the rest of the dish. Everything thing was done half assed and so it ended up tasting that way. Also, no fortune cookies for desert. 

Sad to say that this place has really gone down the drain. I will not be going there again.",0
"I felt like this place is overrated. I prefer nanxiang in flushing over this. The skin is thinner, which I liked but the soup was better over at nanxiang. The pics of famous people on the wall was cool though.",0
"Went to this place near closing time. Ordered the crab and pork dumplings. They were average.  The scallion pancakes here were excellent especially with the spicy red sauce.

The place was buzzing with a lotta people. Would like to come back to try one of the entrees.",0
"Personally I think there's too much hype about this place. There's always a line since they don't take reservations. We got there as soon as they opened and was able to get a table without any problem but noticed the restaurant was completely filled up 30 minutes later and the line outside was already long. The wrapping of the soup dumplings were a little thick I thought so not as delicate as XLB should be. For those of you who had XLBs at Ding Tai Fung on the West Coast or abroad, these XLBs are rather disappointing. The wait staff should be trained to be more personable. They walk and interact like robots so service was lacking. Overall it was a disappointing experience.",0
I've had soups dumplings all  over the world and these are not very good.,0
"The good stuff, Pork soup dumplings (crab dumplings?  can anyone really tast it?), Shanghai Noodle Soup, and the Beef (or Chicken) Pan Fried Noodles, Chicken Rice Cakes.   the rest.. is M'eh... 

It's very Touristy.  It's a long wait sometimes, and you have to have EVERYONE in your party to get a table.",0
"We went here thinking it would be the best Chinese we've had, and it was terrible. Absolutely terrible. The lo mein tasted completed charred, the chicken (#69) we had was bland, the service was crap, and all together, it was a waste of $60 cash, because they don't take credit cards. I'm thinking this place was great at one point but lost its Mojo over time. Don't come here if you honestly want good Chinese. But you all prob still will so whatevs. Hopefully it's better for you.",0
"Still a tourist trap...  After a few months, I gave this place another try. A Sunday lunch with friends and family turned out to be a disappointing luncheon. The pork soup dumplings, fried stripe bass, shanghai noodles were tasty but nothing to rave about. The service provided by the hostess and waiters need a lot to be desired. They need courtesy lessons. if you need a waiter, keep waving your hands. If all the members in your party are not waiting with you, you will lose your table  asap and you'll be ignored and expect to wait another 15-20 minutes, OUTSIDE. As for the bill, there is a 15% mandatory taxable tip-ALL USD CASH ONLY. Just a note, you will share a table with other diners at the table. Go elsewhere. Try 456 Restaurant that's only a few blocks away.The atmosphere and waiters are more respectful and courteous.",0
"Came here with my wife after reading all 480+ reviews to see what all the hype was about.

Here's the gist of it:

Dumplings are pretty good and the whole seating with a bunch of strangers adds to the atmosphere that you are in restaurant in the middle of Beijing. The waiters rush you yet they are not rude, just trying to get their job done in as fast and efficient way as possible.

The only downside is that the place did strike us as a bit on the dirty side when compared to many other Chinese restaurants we've been to. There is a lot of volume with people sitting down immediately after another party leaves and no one cleans the table thoroughly between customers. Considering you are sharing the table with approx. 8-10 other people, it gets pretty nasty after a while. Then again, the soup dumplings were really good and so was the duck we ordered.",0
"Food quality is not as good as it was before. Dumplings are stuck to each other , so they break apart easily.  Wonton soup is too salty and the wrapper is too thick. It was a very good restaurant with the best dumplings in town, but too bad that it is not the same anymore.",0
"I like this place, it's great to take friends that visit to experience a family style restaurant.

There's always a super long wait even on a week day during lunch. 

I've never had the dumplings, because I hate pork but my husband and friends do love them. I always order the scallion pancakes, they're so good!

The chicken and broccoli is decent, it's greasy though. If you take home left overs in hope of heating up later, the box is so disgusting from the grease that it's repulsive to eat.

The place isn't very sanitary, one time during family style eating, the woman next to me spilled her glass of water and the glass broke. The waiter rushed to clean it up, but as he was cleaning it up he nicked his finger on the glass and it started to bleed. Once he noticed the blood, he literally put his finger in his mouth and sucked it up. It was so disgusting!",0
Half star to this place! The service was lousy! They light up incense while we were seated right next to their worship alter! The food is no longer the same especially their well known soup dumplings! The flavor has gotten worse and they all tear apart when you try to nab then! We went there with a party of 3 people and they added tips to the bill without telling us and made us pay for additional tips unknowingly! Talk about losing customers fast! This place really have gone down the gutter! Good riddance! Will never go back!,0
"Well I just don't get it. We showed up an hour before closing and they could not be more pissed. It was FILTHY (ehem, health board), dark and small. All of this I was willing to overlook for these amazing dumplings I heard SO much about. Eh. They were ok. I've had way better. The other dishes were ok too. Not good enough to put up with the attitude, gross interior, and the THICK fog of incense and cigarette smoke. PS. To top it off CASH ONLY. Sigh*",0
"Sadly, I was not impressed. Came here on an extremely cold (15 degrees) night expecting to be warmed up by the yummy soup dumplings but instead, I left disappointed. We tried both the pork and crab dumplings and both was a let down. The skin was thick and ripped easily causing all the soup to spill out. Also, I felt like the dumplings were undercooked and being that it's pork, that's some serious food poisoning that can happen.",0
"If you're looking for some Soup Dumplings, Joe's Shanghai will most likely be the restaurant to pop up at the top of the list. There are 3 locations, and I visited the one in Chinatown. Ambiance and friendly service are non-existent at this restaurant. Yet, you'll find the restaurant always full of customers looking for some good food. The tables are communal, so, be prepared to dine with others and have the opportunity to strike up some fun conversation.

While they're best known for their Soup Dumplings, there's an extensive menu of dishes to choose from. But never mind. Just order the soup dumplings (crab and pork) and a scallion pancake. For me, these are their two amazing dishes. Other dishes here can be hit or miss.",0
"Very greasy and soup dumplings are better at Chinatown Brasserie (I don't even care that it's too white and overpriced. they taste better)

Expect to be underwhelmed and incredibly disgusted with yourself. But try it anyhow, this place is an institution.",0
"I was introduced to soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai about 3 years ago, and man oh man is it good!!  

Everybody has their different methods of eating the soup dumplings.  The way I was taught was to place it on the spoon, bite the tip, then suck all the soup out.  Then, I put a spoonful of that vinegary concoction inside. And I eat the entire dumpling.  Mmmm, sooo goooood!!  I've tried both the pork and the pork/crab, my favorite is the pork/crab.

I've been here a number of times.  I've tried the cold noodles with sesame sauce, scallion pancakes, braised sliced beef, sesame chicken, gen tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, and orange beef - all just okay, not that greatest.  I've had better.

The service is just okay.  The servers are not attentive, and I've always felt a bit rushed.  The restaurant is like any other restaurant in chinatown; decor simple.

Just a warning... During the busy times, if you don't have a large enough group, you may sit with other people - like at dim sum spots.  You can try to beat the crowds by having a late lunch or early dinner.

The only thing about this place that I love is the soup dumplings and the decent prices for them, which I give it three stars. :-)",0
"Overrated. Food was average, line was long, lack of space. Expect to share tables with strangers, they would not spare a single seat (this is not an exaggeration, I mean this word for word). Service is very rushed but food does come out fast. For service alone I would give it a 2 out of 5 stars. Place is not the cleanest, eating utensils  was not cleaned properly. There was some dry food on the side of one of my tea cups. Food is not cheap.
The entire time I was there they were trying to get you out fast, making me feel very unwelcome.",0
"Not worth the hype. Very greasy and not memorable.
The only thing I would recommend is the scallion pancake but you can find those anywhere so don't make a special trip for them here.",0
"I have been an Asian all my life, I know what is good dumplings and what's not.This place is a tourist trap, I had better soup dumpling from else where.

Honestly I think their soup dumbings tasted like the frozen ones I get from Chinese grocery store.  When we received the soup dumplings, they just looked very sad, very droopy, flat and not fresh. The soup flavor was average.
I also ordered the scallion pancake from there, it was moist in the center and not a lot of scallion flavor.

If you have never tried soup dumpling before I guess this place is OK because the price was cheap. But trust me there are better ones out there not worth the wait.",0
"Over-hyped. Rude staff. Soup dumplings quite ordinary. I wish my friend who referred me had told me about the awkward community dining on circular tables. Unless you' have an inside scoop or can talk to the staff, don't bother. It was a wasted meal experience.",0
"This is another highly overrated place but in China Town.
Went there last night to have dinner with my husband as we were in the neighborhood and this was pending one our list.
Waited for more than half and hour to be seated. It was ice cold outside so we kept on standing next to the cashier.
Positives:
Fresh food
Prompt Service
No wait time for food
Negatives
Food tastes only average
Does not accept cards
Does not give you time to breath.
15% service charge?!?!?!?
My husband however, liked the flavor of his pork dish. As for me, sour grapes as always 'cause, I am a vegetarian.  
After dinner the check came and my husband was a little taken aback. This was by far the most expensive Chinese food that we've eaten in the city $50 for 2 people! Thanks to the exorbitant 15% service charge. 
Sorry Joes Shanghai we are taking our business to Vanessa and Prosperity Dumplings.",0
"The waiter ran after us for 2 blocks yelling that we didn't pay the bill. The bill was fully paid. We had to go back to the restaurant and speak to the manager to pull up cameras to prove we paid. It wasn't until he found the waiter who took our money that he believed that we paid. The waiter gave us the bill for the wrong table and we were told we shouldn't come to the waiter to ask for the check but wait for it at the table. We were paying the bill discreetly for a birthday. This was a terrible, mortifying experience.",0
3 stars for food only! This used to be a place I recommended to everyone. It's known for its soup dumplings and fresh food. It has changed so much over the years and I'm so dissapointed. Unfortunately it's definitely not know for its service or cleanliness. It was Chinese New year so I decided to go. I was always willing to take the bad service for good food. Now you will wait for 15-20 minutes to get a small cup of white rice that comes with your meal. If you need any question answered you can forget about it. The most disturbing thing of all is how terribly dirty the place is. Unbearably filthy. The walls right next to the table were filthy and the bathroom smelled like a sewer. Sorry guys I know how much everyone loves Joe's Shanghai.,0
"We went to Chinatown to get some good Chinese food and this place was not it. The staff were not that friendly and the food didn't seem well seasoned, like they were missing salt in everything. We got the fried rice, soup dumplings and I got the hot beef soup. The soup was just hot and not flavorful at all. We will not be back unfortunately.",0
"Invasion of the Dumpling Snatchers!
We've been among Joe's Shanghai's most loyal fans since shortly after it opened in Manhattan Chinatown in 1996. We've introduced generations of visitors and otherwise picky children to its iconic steamed buns (soup dumplings), and never had a dissatisfied customer, not once. So it pains us to report that the Joe's we knew and loved is no more. The new location is fancier and cleaner and a bit larger. The menu is essentially the same, though without the chalkboard specials. On the Monday after Christmas, despite a chill drizzle, the crowd outside seemed larger and more ravenous than ever. (The previous Friday, we'd given up after facing a two-hour wait.)
But to cut to the chase: This was our most disappointing meal of 2019. None of the waiters we'd gotten to know over the decades seem to have survived the move around the corner from Pell Street to the Bowery. The service at Joe's had never been refined, but it was always friendly and attentive. Now you are attended by unsmiling newbies toting iPads, and we had to ask three times for water.
The food wasn't awful. It was simply mediocre. All of our old favorites had been stripped of intensity and flavor. The scallion pancakes and turnip cakes, heretofore light and flaky, were now doughy. The fabled soup dumplings, once so delicate that it required craft and practice to move them to your spoon without bursting them, were so thickly wrapped that you could bounce them off your plate without incident. The soup and pork inside had lost all intensity. The result was perfectly edible and wholly forgettable.
The rest of our dishes were similarly bland. Kung Pao chicken, always reliable, was ruined by dried-out breast meat. The Peking duck--a new addition--was perfectly cooked and totally tasteless. Ditto for the string beans and pea shoots. At that point we gave up and filed out in mourning.
It seems clear that Joe's has a new set of chefs and prep people. We can only wonder if some malign corporate entity bought the Joe's name  and brought in their own talent-free staff. When our waiter wondered why we'd left so much food on our plates, we replied that everything had changed from the old place. He replied that they had just opened. We'd like to believe that with time, Joe's will return to the quality that made it a Chinatown legend. But we're not betting on it.",0
"I came here for the 小笼包 and I was super disappointed. The price wasn't bad, 6.25 for the dumplings. However, the skin was so thin the soup came out the instant you picked it up. I won't be coming back here ever again.

The service was also terrible. The servers were pressuring us to order food the instant we went in and then they were in a rush to get us out.",0
"I think I've been spoiled by the Chinese food in the 626 that I thought these dumplings were just OK.

My friend and I didn't have to wait long for a table, but it was interesting that we were seated with other parties at a family table of 10.  I didn't mind this too much and it probably helped them move customers in and out faster.

We ordered the crab dumplings as well as the pork dumpling.  I preferred the pork over the crab dumplings.  We were pretty disappointed that more than half of our soup dumplings were already punctured in the tray.  I have no idea why they give you a metal tong to pick up the dumplings, when their skins are so fragile as is.  I think it's easier to use chopsticks to save any dumplings that still have soup left in them.",0
"I've been here twice and I honestly don't understand why it has such high ratings. The xiao long bao soup dumplings are ok, but definitely not the best I've ever had, and the rest of the food is just ok. There's almost always a wait, and you have to share a table with other people, which can be really awkward. The wait staff isn't particularly accommodating and overall it's just not really a great experience. Will not be back.",0
"Would have been rated lower if I had to wait longer.  I wouldn't want to roll up here in a large group.

I think the one in flushing is a bit better.  This place had plenty of tourists, and yes, it is funny to watch them stuff a whole scalding hot soup dumpling in their mouth, only to get burned.  The flushing location is bright and airy and this place feels a bit grungy and dumpy.

The dumplings taste the same, but everything seems a bit greasier.

Note:They add tip to your bill! so don't tip twice, unless you really loved it!",0
"I came here with family and I was very disappointed with the service.although the duck we ate was really good, the crisped beef was horrible.we found easily a spot to eat at around 6pm but the waiters are very rude and seem to be doing you a favor for everything you ask.one of them spilled tea in my table and didn't even clean it and when I asked to clean he threw me a paper towel so I would clean it!!! Incredible! I didn't want to give tip but it was 15% included.food has some potential but really horrible service!",0
"2.5 star. I'm rounding up because I haven't been to any other dumpling places in NYC so I don't have anything to compare them with (but I have been to several in Taiwan).

Arrived here at 4 on a Saturday afternoon and there was about a 20 minute wait for 2 people - when we left there was no wait, go figure. I came here just for the soup dumplings, so we ordered the pork dumplings and the pork dumplings with crab. 

What's good about them? Lots of of soup.
What's bad about them? The skin was too thick and chewy. The dumplings were too big and didn't fit properly in the spoon. Yes, in America, bigger is better, but making them bigger destroys the delicate nature of these dumplings. FYI, xiao in xiaolongbao means small. I would peg them at ""medium."" The soup also left a greasy aftertaste in my mouth, sorta like when greasy soup gets cold and solidifies. There was a putrid smell coming from the back of the restaurant. Restaurants in Asian might be dirty and greasy, but at least it's the kind of greasiness that makes you want to come back for more. This putridness... not so much.

Does it live up to its hype? Not really. Should you check it out if you've never had a dumpling filled with soup? Definitely.

Tip: Stop complaining about sitting with strangers, which can be quite enjoyable. It reminded me of wedding banquets back in Taiwan.
Also a 15% tip is included in your bill.",0
"A better version of Joe's Ginger. It is an Americanized Chinese store that has solid soup dumplings, but not the best. There are other stores in NYC that have provided better quality soup dumplings. Joe's Shanghai however, is a solid place to go to that is very friendly to groups. The wait time can be rough during busy hours so watch out!",0
Super disappointed to find out they use pork Lard in all their dishes. Good thing i asked before they started making my order. Had to cancel the order. The young lady was nice enough to accommodate,0
"I'd include a picture of this place in the dictionary under the definition of the word 'over-rated'. 

The original plan was to go to Nom Wah Tea parlor down the road. But it was closed for a private party. So we decided to go to this Chinatown ""must-go"". There is a ridiculous 1 hour wait time any time of the day and a chaotic number calling system. The streets are lined outside this establishment with tired, hungry tourists lining up for a slice of disappointment. 

When we did subsequently obtain security clearance to enter the premises we were seated in a loud family style dining place. We ordered the pork, and the crab and pork soup dumplings, and the seasonal soft shell crab. 

The soup dumplings - In most cases, bigger would be better. But with soup dumplings it is quite tricky. In comparison to other soup dumplings I have eaten these are mutant incredible hulk dumplings. They are huge. There is no way one is going to be able to eat them whole. The point of a soup dumpling is the incredible burst of flavour when you eat it whole and bite into it. The person next to me bit into his dumpling and sent soup splashing across the table. My friend just decided to give up and let the precious soup drip out of his dumpling. I had the worst time of them all. I believe there is such a thing as an ambient soup dumpling temperature. They should be served at a temperature that is safe to eat. I had my entire mouth burnt from the scalding soup and was unable to eat for days after that. While it is easy to blame me or the other diners for our ""inexperience"" at eating dumpling, I have eaten soup dumplings many times before (in NYC, I have eaten them at Nom Wah in Chinatown and the Bao in East Village). I have always escaped injury free. Also a quick glance across the room shows that this was the case with all diners (a lot of whom were Asian as well). Everyone's plates were a mess of spilled soup, every drop of which should be in your mouth. Bigger is not always better.

Soft-shell crab - This is hard to screw up. They are naturally delicious creatures. The breading was oily and not crisp. As much as I could taste with my burnt tongue they were all right. But soft shell crab is usually awesome, not just all right.",0
"These soup dumplings were very very very okay. This place was hyped up to me for a while and so my expectations were to the moon and back. I adore soup dumplings more than life itself, so when I have soup dumplings from a place that people treat like a church, I feel like a sinner for never having gone. 
That...was not the case once I visited Joe's. We ordered soup dumplings. Lots of them. Each one was more okay than the last. They were very okay. SSOOOOO okay that I haven't gone back. Now - I don't want people to think they were bad. They are FAR from bad, but they are super mediocre. Have you ever had that one dish that was SOOO mediocre, it defined the word? That is how I felt leaving Joe's. 
It was a long wait, after a long day, for a very okay meal. 
If a friend wanted to return, would I? of course.
Would I decide to wander down into the bowls of Chinatown for the most okay soup dumplings I've ever had? when there are gold mines near by? Prob's not.",0
"I was very exacted to try this restaurant since I am from Shanghai. Unfortunately, we ordered 4 stuffs and non of them are real Shanghai food. NOT EVEN CLOSE! Hi guys, if u r from china and looking for authentic Chinese food, trust me, do not go to this restaurant. This is basically an overpriced Panda Express.",0
"If I were trying to find the largest concentration of white people in Chinatown, I'd beeline for Joe's Shanghai. There's always an unnecessarily long wait for this popular tourist attraction located in the southern half of Chinatown. I've been two times, and each time was ""meh"" at best. 

Guys, let's be honest, we've all had soup dumplings before, and while they're delicious, they definitely do not merit a 1-2 hour wait. PLENTY of other Chinatown restaurants offer the soup dumplings and they have much better service and much shorter wait time. If this is on your bucket list of ""places to go in NYC"" then fine, do whatever floats your boat. But if you ask me, the last place I'd go in Chinatown is a place with white people, because you just know that means it was recently or has been consistently featured in the NYTimes or some other newspaper. 

I'd much rather trust the locals than some food critic any day.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is a must for New Yorkers and visitors alike. The soup dumplings are awesome and worth the price of admission. The food is great, such as a dish like beef with green beans. It's the good stuff.
I would give them a higher rating but after a few trips to Joe's Shanghai, I noticed some things that I found pretty suspect. Not with the food but with the service or business practices involved. 

1. Servers automatically bring you hot tea. I guess that's common for Chinese restaurants, right? However, I do like the option of being asked because you get charged an extra two dollars on your bill. I've noticed a lot of people who never wanted tea get jacked $2 for it. It's like, ""Here's your tea."" And you're like, ""Thanks, dude!"" And then your bill's like, ""Two more bucks for tea, bro. Did you even want the tea?"" Waste of tea. Waste of money.

2. Tips are included in your bill. They automatically tack on a ""15% service charge"" to your total. Sounds convenient and reasonable, right? But after that, they tax it with the rest of the bill. Wait...is that right? Are they allowed to do that? Doesn't matter because they do. I think that's kind of a dick move because what if the service was bad? How can you stick it to a restaurant with crap service? Your tips get taxed? What?!

Again, I like options when I go into a restaurant. I love Joe's Shanghai but not the shady tricks to up the bill. I would dispute it but I don't want to get jumped by the Triads over hot tea and pork soup dumplings. At least, now you know. And knowing is winning half the battle.",0
"The reason I am giving Joe's Shanghai a 2 and not a 3 is this:
1.  The wait is too long ....and they call number's out then say ""just checking"" as a way to update their waiting list... but it is a big tease when you have been waiting for an hour and are hungry!
2.  The soup dumplings were good, but they the dough was very thin and therefore broke too easily...  it is no fun losing more than half of the soup of a soup dumpling!  I did like that they had the vinegar that goes onto it already on the table when you arrive though.",0
"The famous dumplings that everyone raves about are not THAT amazing. I was so excited to try them during my annual trip to NY and I was deeply disappointed. I mean, they're good but I probably won't return to this restaurant. Beware, 15% gratuity is already added to your bill no matter the size of your party. Restaurant is small and you're probably going to sit next to random people. Also, I was misled by some reviews. This is NOT a dim sum place!!!!",0
"Not bad, but I think overrated. I'm a big fan of soup dumplings; Din Tai Fung is a fave of mine. So given the high ratings for Joe's, I was hopeful. 

We got the scallion pancakes, pork xiao long bao, crab & pork xlb, and string beans 

The scallion pancakes were pretty good - nicely fried and good thickness and crispy. Green beans were tasteless and a waste; don't order it

Onto the dumplings... the pork ones were fine, but nothing special. The crab ones were ok; I actually just preferred the pork ones. A little too fishy for me.

Service was good.

We had a 10-15"" wait, so it's fine, but i wouldn't wait 30 minutes for this. If the wait is short, you might as well try Joe's and see for yourself.",0
"Tourist trap. Xiao Long Bao is humongous, sloppy, and overrated. Doesn't have the thin, fragile skin compared to other more authentic places.",0
"Three stars for the soup dumplings. They were yummy! 

We were a party of seven. Portions are small and expensive considering it's China town. Food was mediocre at best. As a born and raised New York foodie I was not impressed. In fact China town in Queens Flushing blows this specific restaurant in Manhattan out the water. Better options for a better price.",0
"Whoever heard of soup dumplings?  Well, probably not you if you don't live in NYC, 'cause Joe's ""invented"" them. 

Like the majority of China town restaurants the atmosphere is crap. Bright lights and quick, impersonal service is the status quo in chinese places.  The treck there takes you through the twisty, fish-stanky side streets in China town. When you arrive you usually have to wait, because this place is popular.  and CASH ONLY.

Armed with this information, I encourage you to check out Joes for four reasons. 
1) The community seating is a hoot.  You sit at a big round table and try not to talk too loud about the couple to your right.  
2) Its family style, which means your friends eat your food and you eat theirs.
3)The General Tao's is the best I ever had.  My friend ordered it and it came all white meat with a spicy, and not too sweet sauce.  Fried but not deep fried.  I was really impressed.
4) The infamous dumplings.  They're filled with soup.  So instead of ordering Wonton soup, you slurp it from your dumpling.

I am giving it three stars, because i don't like the dumplings and I think they should tell you that it is family style before you order - my friend didn't want to share her General Tao's and it was THAT good.",0
"Great soup dumplings (crab is very tasty)! I have been coming here for years and anytime someone visits, I bring them here.  So why the 3 stars? Only because service has always sucked... But you kind of expect that for a place like this. Try it at least once and just ignore the service like they ignore you!",0
"Overstated and underwhelming. Soup dumplings yummy, soup ok, service pathetic and rude.",0
"Overrated. Sorry New Yorkers, but this place doesn't compare to the ones in CA. After reading all the reviews I was really exited to try this place. 
I was disappointed :( 

Dumplings were not very flavorful. The soup inside the dumplings tasted very greasy. Didn't like having to share a family style table with other customers.",0
"Rude staff, cramped space and the foods not that great. It's a hype... maybe they were good at one time?! From a local.

We waited a good bit of time to get seated. They called our number and we we're walking to the server and she seats someone else. It was a wtf moment. She was completely rude and didn't speak much English.

We were seated at a large round table with other people (fine) and then server comes over to take the order right after. We told him we needed a minute to look over the menu. They guy gets an attitude and told us to hurry because they wanted to get other people in... I guess. 

It was so loud in the restaurant because everyone was so close together.

The food? Way below adverage. I've had better in little hole in the walls in georgia.",0
"Possibly the worst restaurant service I've ever encountered. Food reviews should give a boost to the restaurant, however this restaurant deserves only one star because the food was good. About two weeks ago my friends and I were out in the city and we were looking for a good place to eat. As an iPhone user, I used my Yelp application to look for a good, yet affordable restaurant in Chinatown. Unfortunately, I happen to only look at the good reviews- the ones that praise this restaurant. Do not be fooled everyone. After hours of walking in the city in 90 degree weather, we had finally arrived at the destination following the GPS device. 

One hostess gave us a ticket to wait in line. We asked how long we would have to wait, and she replied 15 minutes. We thought to ourselves, oh, 15 minutes isn't so bad, right? Because we couldn't handle the heat, some of us went into the bubble tea shop next door. Luckily, the air condition was on blast in this place. We also found out that they do not accept credit card. Oh bummer.. 

30 minutes had passed by. Still no sign of the hostess telling us that it's our turn to be seated. Strangely, some people who came after us were getting seated before us. We were confused. We asked what's going on? She gave us the dirtiest look and told us that the people were done eating but were talking and not leaving the restaurant. 

Finally, we were seated. And what do we see? We were sitting with four strangers. First we thought it was four people who came in together, but later we found out that they were two separate couples. 

They also take the wrong order and expect you to just take the food and eat it. We ordered a pork dish but that did not come out, instead it was just general tso's dish. I must say the pork buns were good. 

All in all, I believe that this place is mainly known for tourists who do not know the city well. Here are some things to be wary of

1. Remember to have enough cash because 90% of restaurant in Chinatown do not accept credit cards. There are ATM's nearby the area. 

2. Don't expect to be treated like an actual customer. The waiters are very rude and hostile. They just want to order everything for you, by mistaking your orders.

3. Be open to eat at the same table with strangers!",0
"Highkey overrated and can get better Xiao Long Bao elsewhere. The filling inside the XLB literally tasted like a dense meatball, nothing special and the fatty soup could not save it. The Water Spinach was extremely oily and I could barely eat more than a couple bites. Prices aren't cheap either, the Water Spinach was over $15...not worth.",0
"This place was jam packed full of people.  I guess it was a chinatown hot spot.  

Coming all the way from San Francisco, we thought that we should try the crab meat with pork steamed buns.  It sounded really good.
I'm a little biased, because I've had better in San Francisco.  It was good for NY...but not worth the wait..

I also hated the long bathroom line",0
There is a major lack in the authenticity of their cuisine.  Many of the standard Shanghainese dishes aren't even offered. We ordered the snow cabbage and shredded pork noodle soup.  The broth was awful. The soup filled dumplings were mediocre.,0
"Best in NY? Hardly. 2.5 stars but I'll bump up to 3 cause it wasn't all around horrible. My friend and I went here on a Saturday morning and were awkwardly sharing a large communal table. Just a warning for the odd sized parties - this could also be you.

Here's the breakdown:

1. CASH ONLY.
2. Turnip cake - not what I was expecting exactly. You need to drench it in soy sauce for it to really be good. It felt like was missing something.
3. Scallion pancake - emphasis on the pancake. It was overly thin and filled with grease.
4. Soup dumplings (crab and pork/pork) - more thick dumpling dough than soup and filling. It was overly bland. 

The service is standard for a crowded dim sum spot. They serve you when you ask for something and are trying to clean our room as quickly as possible. I wouldn't come back here for dim sum. It's all hype, not worth it,",0
"Pork buns are one of my favorite foods ever and I like to think myself somewhat of a connoisseur. I've been to Shanghai and had soup dumplings there so my expectations for this place was high. The soup dumplings unfortunately did not live up to the hype in my opinion. The long wait times, apathetic wait staff and noisy, stifling dining room is not worth it for the sub-par food. 

Food: I had one order of the pork soup dumplings with crab and one order without crab. Although the dumplings themselves had great flavor, only about half had actual soup still inside. We had to send a batch back because all the dumplings were completely dry. The second batch came out better, but I still didn't get the hot outpour of soup from the dumpling that I expect. 

Service: As with most authentic Chinese restaurants, the service is abysmal. I am not deterred by this if the food is worth it. The restaurant is very efficient with its tiny dining area by having you order the dumplings right as you sit down. The dumplings come very fast and you munch on it while ordering other dishes if you like. 

Having to share a huge dining table with multiple other parties, the experience overall was hectic and unsatisfying. I hope this was just an off day for them and the next time I crave soup dumplings, I may try it again.",0
Absolutely love. However my last visit left me wondering if I was really eating beef b/c of the meat's texture so I didn't eat it I must say.) deducting 2 stars for that )The dumplings are awesome though!!,0
"BACK TO QUEENS YOU GO, JOE..
when your OG status use to make your Xiao Long Baos gold.

cuz this joint,

is for the
tourist in you...
the strangers next to you..
the frozen premade dumplings steamed back to deceive you...
the oil blasting all over your mouth as your chew your dumpling,fool.
the intended sellingout to profit thanks to you. three Joe Shanghai's in NYC now. which means Kapoot!

no thanks.

so much other better joints nearby. Pshhhhhhh.",0
"Service was good. Compared to the old flushing queens location, the soup dumplings taste so bad. The broth is so bland and the skin is way too thick. We also had the crispy beef that was recommended in a few other reviews but that too was not great. The strips were so thin you can barely taste any beef.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is known for their soup dumplings. That's what I ordered and Spring rolls. First off, let's talk about the atmosphere. It feels so....Americanized. They have Ellie golden, Justin bieber, Coldplay etc on the back playing. It feels out of place. Like someone twerking to classical music. 
I'm not sure what's the hype about Joe's. Maybe cause there's a lot of reviews on Yelp. Their soup dumplings was 'meh' to me. I've had WAYYYY better ones down at Mott st and Bayard st. The meat inside the dumplings wasn't as juicy, and some of the dumplings were deflated so the juices was out. It lacks the sweet pork flavor. If it wasn't deflated it could've masked it. As for the spring rolls, forget it. There was a light brown hair on the plate. Clearly it's not mine, my hair is black. Y'all play too much and the bill came up to $50 that wasn't worth it. Go somewhere else to get soup dumplings. Overall, Joe's doesn't feel or taste authentic. You won't be seeing me back here.
I would give Joe's a 3 stars, but that hair on my plate.....Congratulations, you just played yourself.",0
"Went there the day before Thanksgiving. The soup dumplings are interesting and good AND everything else was terrible including the service. When I returned the pork dish because it literally was slices of fat covered with sugary sauce the waiters were rude and almost insulting. When I refused to pay for the dish, they became very aggressive. The soup dumplings aren't that good!  I will never visit this restaurant again - EVER!",0
"Received several recommendations but I have to say, I was disappointed . 
I don't mind waiting or sharing a table, as a matter of fact I met a lady with ""local ties and we had a very nice chat. 
We ordered the crab and pork dumpling and the crispy noodles with beef and vegetables. The filling in the dumpling felt like a paste of pork, but no nice meaty texture of ground pork and I could not really find any evidence of crab meat. 
The noodles were very thick and no sense of fried crispy. I thought they were very leathery after being exposed to the gravy. Yes, I need to remember that I should not expect them like we have back home. 
The best dumplings I've ever had were in Beijing and I guess I keep hoping to find them in the US. 
Their seating is efficient and service efficient so remember that...they are efficient, not cordial or hospitable. They even had us move seats on the table so they could add another party of 7 delightful young girls. It is all about business, not in a bad way but don't expect it to be a nice family affair.",0
"be prepared to knock some elbows while you eat because they seat you next to other parties on the same table. 

XLB is pretty good here but their kao fu is LEGIT! must try.",0
"It is all about the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai. This is where it began with soup dumplings and one friendly stranger.

The seating area puts strangers with other strangers at the large tables. It is fun being forced to make new friends.  We got to sit with a few strangers and one in particular had parents that preached sharing is caring. She ended up giving her last four soup dumplings to our group and that became our appetizer.

Onto to our little starlet, Soup Dumplings. They need to put a fragile sign on there because I am awful at handling these little delicacies. Between me being overzealous on the first couple and burning myself to me not properly opening them and juices ending up everywhere but my mouth, I think it is safe to say I am no soup dumpling expert. It did not stop me from enjoying every moment of the experience.

Sadly, Not all were created equally.

The Bok Choy tossed with Garlic had no garlic flavor at all. The garlic seemed to be just tossed in at the end, thus not allowing its flavors to come out. It is obvious when a cook does not use the garlic properly in a dish; it looks whiter than Casper the ghost.

The Fried Rice was nothing special and, to steal a line from my man Forrest Gump, that is all I have to say about that.

And the service.....

Well was what you expect a Chinese restaurant. It being to the point and very impersonal, but that is fine as long as they are quick with their service.

All in all, I will be back one day for my new friend, Soup Dumpling.",0
"Joe's Shanghai is A-OK. 

Joe has been on my NYC to do for a while, and I got to experience it in all of it's glory on a Friday night.  I love that this place hasn't lost it's charm or been fully gentrified as it grew in popularity - the service isn't great, the menus are old and items are still spelled wrong but corrected with a few strokes of a Sharpie, and there is no ambiance.  I love it. 

We sat at a table of 6, and made friends with two Italian tourists who were visiting NYC for just a few days.  Love the communal seating arrangement.  Obviously the soup dumplings were ordered, and they were even more fantastic than I had imagined - $6.95 for 8? Sweet deal.  We also ordered some chicken dish, but it wasn't very memorable so I don't remember the name.  Our meal cost a total of $20 for two, and we could not find room in our bellies for anything else.  Except for the gratis orange slices that were presented to us with our check. 

Here's a good part of why I am subtracting two stars.  The Italian pair we made friends with had a bill of $78!!! That is an absurd cost for 2 at Joe's Shanghai - we paid $20.  They consulted with the waiter whether two entrees, and two orders of soup dumplings and two beers would be sufficient for the both of them - the waiter said yes, and had we of known we would have corrected him immediately.  I understand this can be a tourist trap and all, but the good person in me felt that was a bit unfair. 

Here is my CASH ONLY disclaimer.   

We hopped over to Apotheke for a quality cocktail afterward, and recommend you do the same pre or post Joe's. Note - you can't bring your Joe's leftovers to Apotheke, no food allowed.",0
"Simply put, Joe's Shanghai is expensive for what it is in terms of quality and portion size. The portions are smaller than your average dish in most restaurants in Chinatown. We ordered the crab meat xiao long bao, lo mein, sauteed rice cake, the cold beef appetizer, and a plate of veggies. One dish that we simply inquired about but did not order was added to our orders as well, which is not appreciated - make sure you are very clear with what you are ordering and what you are simply asking about. Most of the dishes were simply bland. A freshly sauteed rice cake was already getting cold and stiff. The crab meat xiao long bao is the most flavorful menu item we ordered and too heavy for my liking. Nonetheless, it was pretty good when eaten immediately (before the dough gets cold and stiff). The crab meat is not imitation crab but rather actual meat from a crab. As mentioned, the food here is very expensive when you can easily get something cheaper and tastier in Chinatown - comparable Shanghai restaurants are a few dollars less PER dish which can easily add up. Lastly, more non-locals visit this restaurant than locals themselves. 

P.S. their vinegar dip for the xiao long baos is strong 

***Cash only!",0
"Seating was limited and they wanted my party of 4 to seat with two other individuals I didn't know. I decided to wait for a table of 4. Food was awful had extremely salty scallion, with ginger chicken never again. The only thing that was edible was the fried dumplings. Spare yourself the headache go somewhere else.  The reviews and the wait to be served were both misleading since I will never ever go to the place. 0 stars",0
"I first heard of Joe's Shanghai over 10 years ago on some Travel Channel show and the food looked so fantastic that I always wanted to try it.  Finally, I got my chance the other day and I was so let down.

#1 - I know this is a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown but we are NOT in China.  I don't appreciate the communal tables (unless you ask me first).  I had to sit next to 2 people who kept asking each other, ""Wow, how did they get the soup in there?""

#2 - We ordered the second we sat down but the food took almost half an hour to come.  Really?  Steaming 1 order of soup dumplings takes that long?

#3 - The dumplings had plenty of soup but the meat filling had no flavor whatsoever.  I'm from China and I know that authentic XLB meat is not overseasoned but it shouldn't be bland either.

The positive is that the price was pretty good.  Trying Joe's was always a dream of mine so I guess my dream came true. Yay.",0
"Why am I sucker for # of reviews on Yelp?  Let me breakdown the timeline:

11:40am - we sent a junior co-worker into a meeting on our behalf to take notes.

11:41am - I assemble 3 co-workers and we decide to walk to Chinatown for lunch.  

12:05pm - The original plan was to check out Prosperity Dumpling, but it seemed too far and we were unsure of the seating situation for 4 people.  We passed by Pell Street and I remembered that Joe's Shanghai was on 9 Pell St and had a ridiculous amount of reviews (that should be automatic right?).  I convince everyone to go, we get seated at our own table (there were a # of communal tables), and ordered:

- Crab and Pork Soup Dumplings: they were just OK (I kind of pushed everyone's expectations by saying that it's what they were famous for)
- Pork Buns: average mystery meat pork buns
- Shanghai Rice: the eggs and scallions were too plain  
- Pork Fried Rice: the better of the rices we received (nothing to write home about either).  
- Braised Pork Shoulder: wow, they weren't kidding (it looked like a charred pork shoulder).  It was good, but heavy.
- Orange Beef: good, but the beef pieces were chunks.
- General Tso's Chicken: pretty standard 
- Soft Shell Crab: it was good (I didn't get why it was served with different colored syrofoam)    

12:38pm - I invited our junior co-worker to join us because we ordered WAY TOO MUCH food (by sending him a picture of our table).

12:38pm - 12:50pm: I try to give turn by turn instructions to my directionally challenged co-worker via text (he quit).

1:05pm - we get the bill with 15% automatically added in (I didn't get that since we were only 4 people and I see 20% as automatic) and we had to roll each other down Pearl Street while in food comas.

By the way, they are cash only.",0
"I just want to preface this with, this is not my mother's Chinese restaurant. This is my white friend, pulling her eyelids back, and making Chinese food. It's borderline offensive.

I'm sure Joe's was great at one point in time. 

I walk in, and there's a sour scent in the air. I've been here once last summer, and was pretty stunned with how mediocre this place is while ALL my non-Chinese (and a few Chinese) friends rave about this place. 

People always talk about soup dumplings so awesome that Olivia Wilde, Jonah Hill, and Jake Gyllenhaal's been here. I already have my own soup dumpling joint in Chinatown, so I might be slightly biased here. 

The first time I was here, I had only the soup dumpling. It was too salty, to gingery, and lacked any other flavor. I left, and vowed to never return. (There's always a long line for mediocre soup dumplings).

Last night, I went to dinner with a couple of our friends to get lobster, and needed a little booster afterwards. My friend raved about the soup dumplings, so we got that, along with stir-fried rice cakes. 

Stir-fried rice cakes is something my mom made for me since I was a child and it's one of my favorite dishes, ever. 

We got the soup dumplings, and I wish they were salty and ginger. They were so bland. The dumplings tasted frozen, and not even wrapped right. 

The rice cake finally came out, and THEY PUT SOY SAUCE ON RICE CAKES. The beef was too salty, the rice cake tasted weird, and it was pretty terrible. I paid for it, I ordered it, and I was hungry. Otherwise, I'd never eat it. 

The only redeeming factor is that the servers are really nice. They're really accommodating towards tourists and I KNOW they are overworked.",0
"Yes the soup dumplings are good.  but the service and attitude and wait are not worth it now that there's shanghai cafe (is it a spinoff of the one in the tunnel?)...

careful with the bill, the gratuity is tacked on the bill.  i can't manage to remember this every time i go, so have double tipped like half the time.",0
Overrated spot. Dumplings were way too fatty and gross I couldn't even eat them. Noodles had barely any beef in them. The sesame chicken was good but nothing special. I ordered take out and they called me 3 times telling me to hurry up and pick up my order since they were closing. Totally understandable. I rushed to pick it up only to get there and see multiple parties still dining in. Not sure why they were blowing up my phone.... won't be coming back here.,0
Not sure why this place is so highly rated.  The food was good but not out of this world and the service was horrible.,0
"Okk...I know,this is probably the most popular Chinese restaurant in Chinatown,NYC  (though I coudn't figure it out,why???)....and I had high expectations set,which were definitely not fulfilled!!!!...I will explain you,why!!!!...
Firstly,the place is so dirty,smelly,small for so many people,very poorly maintained...a perfect ghetto....
Secondly,the service!!!...It cannot be worse than this...you have to wait in a long line and also act as a gatekeeper and after that,when you sit,they will not give you enough time to think what to take...even if you try to take it,you will see their annoyed faces...and my friend ordered one dish,which was served to me,and I asked the waiter to serve it to my friend,instead...the waiter uttered something in Chinese with lots of annoyance (I know for sure,they are cusswords)!!!....so RUDE!!!!
Thirdly,after waiting for a long time,and it was a hot day (Memorial Day,2014)we were not even served with water...we had to drink from our own bottle,...
Fourthly,the waiter did not know,what type of wine was served as the House Wine on that day...he had to go inside and he took out the whole bottle to show us...it was so much ridiculous!!!
and Finally,the FOOD!!!!!....oh my god!...it was horrible!...the soup dumplings were better of the lot...but was OK type,not great,that you would die for it!...I have tasted many dumplings which are far better than this!...and the other dishes in the main course was not upto the mark!...one even tasted so bad,we thought it was rotten!!!...We didn't like the food,at all,though we were hungry like sharks!!!!....that's the main thing....
and for that horrendous service,you have to pay the 15% tips on the total bill amount....which we really thought,we would never give...but it was added to the bill!!...guess what,they know,they don't deserve it,so people are not gonna give it!...so they just forcefully take it from you!
I would never ever go back to this terrible place....it sucks....please don't ever go....don't recommend others!....I would not even give them one star,if I could!",0
"We came here at around 3:30pm on the Saturday after Christmas. The wait for 6 people was about 35 minutes. The staff works their asses off here, and the crowds make it even harder. We got to our table, a big round meant for 8, we shared the table with 2, not a bad deal.
 
So obviously the soup dumplings (xiao long bao) are obligatory. We ordered the pork and the crab/pork. They were good, the shell was sturdy and the dumplings were big, but they were just good. The crispy shredded beef was tangy and had a great texture, the cold sesame noodle were also nice.

We've been going to John's Shangai for years and I think they're xiao long bao was better, and we never had to wait on line. I would try it at least once, it's cheap and delicious, but the wait is definitely a turn off.",0
"The soup dumplings were pretty good but not amazing.  The ""soup"" in the XLBs were  based on fatty pork, not aspic, which is what is supposed to create the richness.

The vegetarian duck was quite unique and tasty.  

Overall, the price is quite reasonable.  I am glad I tried it once, but will not return to wait another 1.5 hours for the food.",0
"We checked yelp prior to and found this place, very busy so we thought it would be good. Our sever was maybe 15 and could have cared less about us. Never returned to check on us and the tip is included with the bill otherwise he wouldn't have gotten anything. Food was ok, won't be returning customers.",0
The wait staff was the rudest I've ever encountered. We had never been before and they sat us after we waited outside (which was fine as there is no room inside) we sat down and the waiter immediately asked us for our order. He knew we had not looked at a menu. I had to tell him to come back three times. I felt so rushed and as if we were an unwelcome guest. We did order in a timely manner and he didn't listen. It was a rough experience and we will not be back. There were two of us and the 18% tip was already included.   That's all he got and I'm a generous tipper usually.,0
"Food is always 5 stars but their service is always 2-3 stars. I order soup dumplings right away since they would take a while. Tables sat down after me received their tea and I told the waiter. He said it's coming and then went to take care of other customers instead of fetching me tea. The second waiter I asked was surprised and said I was with the two girls next to me.  I reminded him we had order food separately. 

He came back in a few minutes and asked if I wanted anything else. I told him i just need another minute.  He never came back to check on me.  I could have doubled the check but he was too lazy to come back. 

Then the bill came with 15% tip already added whether service was good or bad.   They also round UP your bill when going change.  My bill was $7.61.  I was going to give then $20.01 but can use the few pennies.  They gave me back  $11.35.  So my bill was up to $7.65. I know places that would round down their customer's bill.   Yeah it's only 4 cents.  But you know how many bills the process each day.  4 cents becomes 4 dollars then 40 dollars....",0
Service was ok. Soup dumplings were great. Definitely saw a little white mouse run through the kitchen...,0
"typical bad service from a chinese establishment. i also thought it was weird that they seated us at a large sharing table with others (hostess didn't mention it to us prior to seating us - as we would have enjoyed having our own table). service was bad, they pretty much ignored us. the pork soup dumplings were nothing special, i've tasted better",0
"Ugh, my 2 stars is being generous. I've been to this place many many times, and those were all 4 stars. Today's experience was so MEH, I had to write this review. I went in to pick up a pan fried noodle order in the afternoon. I think the chef must have been on his lunch break, because the dish I received, I had to throw out, it was that bad.  The sauce was overstarched. It was disgusting.  In my life I've only thrown out food less than 5 times.  What a waste. 

I'll go there for their soup dumplings, but that's it.",0
"Food is good - slightly on the salty side.  The Xiao Lung Bao is very good.  I go there just because of that.  Otherwise, I would NOT eat over there:

Because ......

First, they add 15% service charge despite their less then professional service.  (Yes, there is a sign saying about adding the service charge - but it is printed on a regular white piece of paper with small letter font - may be a 10 pt. font? from 5ft away???)    Cash only and automatically add 15% service charge.  And make sure you ask for the change when you pay the bill or your might not get your change back. (That happened to me twice - accidental?)

Customer service and clearness is way way way below par.  I had to exchange my utensils and my vinegar for Xiao Lung Bao because they were not up to par.  And the fun part was that:  I particularly had to beg them to give me a new vinegar because they insisted that they were clean.  (And you call that a Customer service with automatically 15% tips?)",0
"The soup dumplings are good.........but for AMAZING soup dumplings either go to flushing or to Williamsburg's M Shanghai bistro. Yeah, so I worked there for awhile but even if I didn't I'd say the same. Joe's is perpetually packed with tourists, which sucks, but there food is good.",0
"I just noticed tonight that they put 15% service charge on the bill, add that with your bill, THEN tax you on that subtotal amount.

Why are you charging me tax on the service charge?????

Ridiculous!",0
"We went around 8:45pm and were told a 30+ minute wait, which is a bit too much for New York restaurants, especially since there is no Yelp waitlist. When you are seated, you essentially share a large table with multiple parties, which can be fun or awkward depending on the group dynamics and your personality. It was ok for us.

The food failed to meet the expectations of the wait. We got the sesame noodles and the pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao). The sesame noodles were prepared poorly because of the flavor and the starchiness texture that accentuates the poor flavor. The xiao long bao was okay, as I have tried much better before. You carefully pick up the dumpling and place it in a spoon in case the soup leaks out. This was necessary because these dumplings are relatively large compared to the standard. The soup is pretty good but the pork inside needs improvement as it is not that flavorful. Overall, this place seems to be overhyped and definitely not worth the wait.",0
"I brought my mom to this place to try their Shanghainese dumplings, boy was it a bad decision. Seeing that there was a wait outside the restaurant, you'd expect it to be a good restaurant. Once you walk in, all you see are tourists and ""folks"" that just want to ""experience"" the dumplings. With all the positive ""expired"" media and Zagat reviews, the restaurant is basking in it's former glory.

The specialties at this restaurant is traditional Shanghainese food. Stick with the basic or crab shao lung bao dumplings and you'll enjoy the food. The pot roast is pretty good too. Anything else is plain garbage, especially the rice and noodle plates.

The WORST part of eating here is the automatic 15% gratuity added to your food bill BEFORE taxes. Anyone want to explain to me why they tax you on tips? To MANY unsuspecting tourists or fools, they look past the 15% gratuity and put down more tips. Seeing how this is an Asian establishment, I won't be surprised if the owner let's the workers keep the post-bill tips, while he profits additionally from the pre-bill 15% gratuity.  

Also there is a HUGE pricing discrepancy of the dumplings on the menu. When we received the bill, I noticed that they charged TWICE the price that was stated on the menu. WTF is that all about? Instead of $6.65 for the crab meat dumplings it was $13.30 on the bill. The pork version was $4.65 on the menu, yet $9.30 on the tab. VERY VERY dishonest business practice.

+1 star for serving ""ok"" dumplings and pot roast.

- 100 stars for the super shady price discrepancy and the  pre-bill 15% gratuity.

-1 star for being forced to share tables with others. (isn't it entertaining for a Caucasian diner to be boasting to his friends that this restaurant serves the most ""authentic"" Shanghainese food in front of Shanghainese folks?)

AVOID at all cost! IF you must, and I say must try Shanghainese shao lung bao dumplings. Take the 7 train to the Flushing Chinatown and eat at Nan Shian dumplings. They serve the best HONEST Shanghainese dumplings in all the NY boroughs.",0
"I used to think the XLB here was the best in the nation.  That was a few years ago.  I recently visited Joe's as I was in NY on a business trip.  There were plenty of open tables but they made me sit with other ppl.  That's fine, but just be prepared for it.  

I ordered the crab meat and pork XLB's.  They were hot and for the most part pretty good.  The downgrade is that some of the dumplings had already leaked prior to them delivering it to me.  Another minus is that the tables are really cramped.  This dude sitting next to me mixed up his XLB and ate one of mine!  I'm like you touched it,  I ain't gonna eat that one.  

I've heard from other locals that there are better places/less touristy than Joe's which I will have to check out.  It just didn't taste as good this time around.",0
"Been coming here for years. Food is awesome and service is quick. 
Just one tip, no matter how long they say the wait is, add half an hour. That way your expectations are realistically set and you enjoy your meal rather than being annoyed at how the hostesses lied to you.",0
"This place is so overrated! It's not worth the wait. I came here on a weekday at 6p-ish and it was crowded. I think we ended up waiting like 40 minutes.

Joe's Shanghai is known for their xiao long tong bao (shanghai soup dumplings). First of all, good xiao long tong bao is supposed to be light, thin skinned, and flavorful. Joe's Shanghai's dumplings are thin skinned, and flavorful, but it's not light and is actually a little greasy and salty. Chinese food is not greasy! American Chinese food is greasy! Nothing else we ordered here was that impressive. 

This place isn't Ding Tai Fung. In fact, it's not even close. If you've ever had good Xiao Long Bao, I wouldn't waste my time coming here. If this is your first time trying it though, then I guess it's not a bad start. This place is really for those who've never had soup dumplings.

Additionally, my boyfriend got sick from eating here. 

I personally prefer Shanghai Cafe for xiao long tong baos. The skin is not as thin but the flavor is better.",0
So this place is known for its pork soup dumplings. They are definitely yummy. I would go back for that but not for much else really. There is a line and they dont tell you they will sit you with strangers. So if you're expecting to be just seated with your party of four prepare to have guests. The noise level is high and the atmosphere is like that of a frat house with mostly young people from out of state. The people who are in the know take their stuff to go. I will do the same in the future.,0
"I was really disappointed to walk in and find out that it wasn't a restaurant that has a variety of dim sum. Pictures of dim sum are the first items shown on the website, so I took an Uber there ready and excited to eat that. I got there, sat down, and found out there are only two types of dim sum, and they are only appetizers. They were ok enough but I wish I had looked at the menu before taking and Uber there.",0
"Soup dumplings (xiao long bao) are a must-try when you're in Chinatown. Joe's Shanghai is a popular choice for authentic soup dumplings, but it's also a bit touristy. We were expecting a long line, but they seated us right away with other people like a communal seating. It's still better than waiting. 

Food came out really quick. Soup dumplings were hot and delicious, but some of the soup were already leaking from the bottom of dumplings before I even grabbed them with my chopsticks. They probably steamed our dumplings too long. Because of that, I didn't really get that ""burst"" or ""pop"" in my mouth. I also recommend getting a scallion pancake. They were crispy just the way I like it. Overall, soup dumplings were good, but I'm just disappointed about the leak. Also, this place is cash only!!!",0
"This place has GREAT food. It was the first time I've ever had soup dumplings and had me return later that same week for more. I've since had more soup dumplings at several other places but this may still be the top but it could just be nostalgia. I've had other dishes and they were equally as good. You cannot go wrong with the food and going with big groups. 

Regardless of the party size, tip is included and I've got to say the environment is a bit chaotic and cramped but the worst is the service. It seems, to get people to order quickly, servers will standby waiting until you've been pressured enough to order. 

Despite that, I will visit again at some point.",0
"I was really excited to try this NYC staple so the fact that the food didn't live up to the hype is a bit disappointing. I did take out rather than wait in line for dine-in, so this review is on the food only. I LOVE XLB and was expecting a lot from these famous ones. They were tasty, plenty of flavorful dumpling juice, but every single one of my dumplings was punctured - surprising because the dough was thick, which also wasn't that appealing. So I had dumpling soup...which wasn't bad, but didn't give me the joy of biting into a gushing xlb. I also ordered the cold noodles with sesame sauce and barely ate any of it. Noodle with thick, pretty tasteless sesame paste that I couldn't bring myself to finish.",0
When me and my friends walked in we were like on nice place got our seats. The dumplings was great but the service was so poorly organize. We didnt get our beers till like 20 mins later and we have been waitting for our other meals over 40mins. Sorry!! Maybe next time in a couple years.,0
"Not worth the hype.

There are better places for soup dumplings like shanghai cuisine a few minutes walk away.

Soup dumplings:
-thick skin
-soup was very thick
+cheap
+quick to the table

Rice cakes were mediocre, too oily and not enough veggies/meat

Dine in:
~ a lot of people, on the loud side
-could be seated at a big table with strangers
+waiters take away empty dishes quickly
-feel rushed bc of the fast paced service",0
"I usually don't write yelp reviews but my experience at Joe's Shanghai was EXCEPTIONALLY bad. I came with a friend on Sunday, and we were seated fairly quickly at a large round table with some other strangers which we didn't mind - we actually appreciated the efficiency. A waiter also attended to us pretty quickly, and all we put in an order for 1 order of pork soup dumplings. 

Then, we waited for OVER ONE HOUR to get our dumplings. All of the other groups at our table were getting SECOND, even THIRD orders of soup dumplings while we patiently waited for ours to come. We nicely asked the waiter how much longer the wait would be and he appeared to have forgotten what we ordered. When the dumplings finally came, they were pretty good, but not worth the one hour wait. While I recognize we were there on the Sunday after Chinese New Year and the restaurant was especially busy, it is pathetic that we had to wait more than an hour for just a 8 soup dumplings, especially because people that ordered after us were served first. 

We will not be returning to Joe's Shanghai.",0
"So, so good.  Be prepared as Joe's Shanghai seems to have a perpetual 20-30 minute wait no matter what time you show up.  

Prices are good, servings are large and are served quickly.  I particularly enjoy their double cooked pork with rice.",0
"So on my recent trip to NYC I decided to test the highly talked about Joe's Shanghai in Manhattan's Chinatown. I ate at 14 restaurants that weekend and this was the first restaurant with a C rating from the city 

So I started off with the Crab and pork Xiao Long Bao. Not sure why it's called steamed buns on the menu but yea they we're good but nothing to rave about. Strong crab flavor (roe) with lots of broth oozing out.Coming from the west coast we definitely have better XLB. 

Second dish was crispy beef strips. Which pretty much tasted like orange beef from panda express or one of those Western Chinese restaurants. 

Final dish I tried was the spicy bean curd and pork. Pretty much ma po tofu. The dish was lacking spice and they were kinda skimp on the pork. 

Having tried it now I probably wouldn't go back... There are so much better restaurants in that area to eat.",0
"I personally thought this place was over-rated but a good value.  The soup dumplings were large but not as delicious as i've had in other places.  The fried noodles were pretty good. Sharing a table wasn't too fun, but not horrible.",0
"Good dumplings, nice braised pork shoulder.  Service was fine.  Cash only.",0
"Although this restaurant chain has been featured on cooking shows for their dumplings, this particular location is overrated. The minimum wait on a weekday is over half an hour, and the service is terrible.  What's worse, those waiting in line hover over your table and overtly drool over your meal. Tasty. Insult to injury after the wait was the fact that there are only two choices of dumplings. 

My suggestion is to find another dumpling place that actually has more variety. Chinatown has too many options, and one shouldn't feel compelled to go to this one.",0
"Overhyped tourist trap I think.. The xiao long bao or soup dumpling was nothing spectacular. The only thing I will remember about the dumplings was that they were MSG filled and so were the rest of the food. I love dumplings and I just had 2 of these. Was not even tempted to eat more. 

The fries rice tastes so mediocre, and again overly greasy again. The eggplant's sauce was too thick as well. The pork chops were actually fried well but seasoning and flavor were a disappointment and tasted like the typical MSG-filled food they have. 

Good thing we did not have to wait very long to be seated because a wait will definitely not be worth it.",0
Gross food and dirty. Quintessential Chinatown: dirty & low quality food. Want some real proper Chinese food dedicated to those with actual tastebuds and standards? Don't come here... unless you are an uncultured foodie with low standards that enjoys oily fatty low quality Xiao long Bao.,0
"It was windy, cold, and rainy (Hurricane Sandy was on her way), so what better way to spend our brunch then with some Shanghainese comfort food? 

We came here with a party of six and were seated at a round community table with two other parties. I admit, it was slightly awkward having strangers sit across from us, but it was whatever. We ordered several orders of their very popular soupy dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0CjK3esfpFcxIopebzjFxA?select=4iBG8FQNL37Q8mntLsGJyg#4iBG8FQNL37Q8mntLsGJyg), an order of their onion cake, and an order of their pork chops. I've been spoiled with great dumplings in Southern California, so I would say that I have pretty high standards and the dumplings from Joe's was at most average. I didn't like that the dumplings were so big and the skin was too thick for my liking. Albeit there was a lot of tasty soup inside, it just didn't quite hit the spot for me. I tried a little bit of the fried pork chop and it wasn't anything special. It was very lightly seasoned and came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. The onion cake was good though. 

Customer service was lacking of course, but that didn't deter the crowds. At least Joe's is officially marked off my bucket list now!",0
"This place typifies gross chinese food that is fit only for stupid midwestern tourists. It is really greasy and oily. None of the food tastes like anything, except for the pools of grease that it sits in. We ordered both pork and beef dishes, with scallion pancakes and springs rolls. Everything came fried, and left a waxy, greasy film on the inside of your mouth. Even the dumplings, which they are ostensibly famous for, tasted like a load of salt, msg, and fat. The worst part was the meat. If it could be classfied as 'fit for human consumption' I would be shocked. It was stringy, fatty chunks of mystery meat, that most closely resembled the overcooked gristle carved off poor quality steak.

If you like eating with lots of strangers (because you don't get your own table), very poor service (and the fact that a very fat tip is already included in your bill), and fat posing as meat, this is the place for you. However, you'll probably want to eat at McDonalds, because this food tastes about the same, just five times as expensive.",0
"I like their steam crab meat bun and rice cake. It is always crowded with people. I wish it is less crowded or larger seating place. Not a good atmosphere for eating, it make me feel rushing.",0
"(Disclaimer: this one isn't about the food since we didn't get to sit down, it's about how rude we were treated when trying get a table)
Me, my wife and three kids (10, 7, 4) were out in Chinatown for Doctor appointment. Decided to have lunch before going home. 
Pell Street was closed for the many restaurants. Tables are all over the street, and hard to distinguish which section belongs to which restaurant. We stood near the entrance of the restaurant hoping to talk to one of the server. One of the troubling sight I observed was customers has to help the server get the steaming hot little steam buns placed on their table. Then one of the server, said to us, ""this is the entrance, don't stand here"" we were on the side of the entrance, not in front of it. Then the 2nd one came out, and i asked ""Hi, do u have a table of five?"" (I spoke to him in Cantonese, which is what I heard him spoke to the other server) he said, ""五個人！邊有位比五個人!"" (Translation: Five people! Where can I get a table for five people!?"" 
Granted, it's not easy to run in and out from the restaurant onto the street; but don't take your frustration on your customers 
Of cz we moved on to a different place.",0
"This place is not as great as everybody is trying to say. I must admit the dumplings were great and probably better then at other places I've been to, but not that much. The food was very common, there are better restaurants.

What I really hate is the queue in front of the restaurant. Me and me friend we waited 50 mins to get in, because we thought it would be something really special. They seated us to a table with random people who were already eating. Man it was weird. The service was also not that good and slow, as there were too many people. They also brought my food first and my friend got his food after ten minutes after we asked them.",0
"Came here with my friends a few days back, it was not packed like how everyone said it was (we came here at around 3-4). We ordered the Crab Meat Pork Soup Dumplings, the Shanghai Flat noodles and Scallion Pancakes. The pancakes were so frigging good, we had to order two. The soup dumplings were really fishy, and did not taste up to par as my friend had said so, she even agreed herself. The frozen ones I can buy from a supermarket, are much better than these. The flat noodles were pretty good, except it was very oily. That amount of food got 3 of us full, so I would say the serving size is generous. I would not come back here for their soup dumplings, maybe come back and try just the pork soup, but I will definitely come back for the scallion pancakes. Also, they do charge a mandatory 15% tip, it was listed on the back of the menu. To be honest, I think they treat the Asians better than they do other races just because....",0
"Food: 6/10. The food is definetly not bad tasting but nothing too special also. 

Environment 5/10: The place is obviously small just by judging from the outside. Just hate that fact that they sit you with other strangers in this round table if u come in with 2 people or just yourself. So get read for awkward conversations. 

Service: 6/10: The servers are definetly very attentive and they check up on you every now and then. They should give the option where customer's should sit though. 

Tip: I know this place gets busy at certain times specially night and weekends. But if you are very hungry and see a long line outside the restaurant, just come up with a different plan. You are not missing anything.",0
"This place amazes me - more because of its high ratings. 

The worst service ever - servers staring at when you'll finish your food (lol) - we got the menu and the server immediately asked so what do you want- it was a strange service!

Coming to the  food - the server cut the fried noodles so aggressively that it came flying on my face (of course no apology needed ;) his elbow hit us - again not bothered to apologize!

Ambiance : loud chaotic and yet was being managed - no complaints here

Payment : Those with credit cards beware this is CASH ONLY!

 Which brings me to another very interesting point - they actually have two ATMS inside the property so you can take cash out!! 

Is that even permitted?

Either ways - a v v bad experience and of course I'll never be back! Tons of places to eat in China town so don't fall for the one with most reviews and high ratings!!",0
"The soupy dumplings are very nice and worth a trip to try, but the service and overall atmosphere leave much to be desired. The waiters are downright rude and chase customers for larger tips. Treatment of tourists is shameful.",0
"Overhyped Shanghainese fair.

Don't get me wrong, the food was certainly edible. But after all we had heard and see with the piles of people outside, my friends and I thought we would have experienced more here.

Seating was fast and service was great, but the food was the star letdown. Everything we ordered was best described as mid. The scallion pancakes though, may have been the least ""scallion""-filled I have ever had. Ever the pork soup dumplings had very little soup or unique flavor.

Strangely, despite our party of five, we were initially only given four duck skins for our roasted duck. We had to ask for a fifth since it would have been unreasonable to ""split"" a wrapper. We're thankful the staff were kind enough to offer an additional wrapper, but found it strange that it was standard to not include it. We would have been OK paying for extra if we had more people or if we had ordered more duck. But to expect us to wrap a WHOLE duck in just four skins is a bit too much.",0
I've never had such an awful service in my life. They literally tried to remove my plate from the table while I was still eating. Food is ok but there are better restaurants in the area.,0
"I was brought here by a friend a couple years ago and wasn't that impressed. Decided to give the place another chance and apparently nothing's changed.

The XLB's were nothing special, think dough wrapping, average tasting meat. The yin su rolls were as expected, their hong sao fish had tonnnns of bones, and their shanghai rice cake dish tasted like something I could have made at home.

The place has a wait though I'm not sure why. Groups of 3-expect to share tables with another party. All in all I'm still disappointed and would rather try another restaurant in the area.",0
"Don't buy into the hype. Just don't do it, especially if there is any sort of a wait.  

Good soup dumpling: thin skin but doesn't break when you pick it up with chopsticks.  Juicy, but not greasy or oily.  Flavorful, and the skin is not doughy.

Joe's Shanghai: opposite of everything I just listed above.

I been here several times with groups of friends and always thought the place was ""meh"" (but then I think that of the majority of Chinese restaurants on the in New York... ).

This time, I was nearby, missing Soup dumplings, and decided to give it a try myself - and realized I must've not paid much attention to the food as I did the conversation those previous visits because the food is as other reviews have mentioned... So oily, so greasy, and just overall not of a good quality (why are parts of my soup dumpling yellow?  From the grease?).  The overly aggressive service didn't help either, though I was one of only 4 tables filled at the place, they came by to make sure I still had my last two dumplings left four-five times so they could clear me out.

I flew back to LA this week and made it to a good soup dumpling place just to do a comparison and make up for this meal.  And wow...  Night and day difference.  

Hungry Kat does not approve.",0
"2nd night in the Big Apple and after a disappointing 1st night dinner we wanted to try the best they can offer in Chinatown.  Check yelp and this place have an outstanding review.  When we got there the wait is an hour.  And bec there were about 50 people waiting in line to get in, we decided to wait and give this place a try.  Xiao long bao or soup dumpling was our main purpose and this is our favorite food and boy oh boy what a big disappointment.    The taste is   bland.  Most of the customer have to share table with strangers which I don't mind if the food is worth it.  Hing Kee in Chinatown Chicago has better Xiao long bao or soup dumpling.  Their other food are ok and nothing special.  What makes their food taste better is bec of the MSG.  You'll know because an hour after eating you will be very thirsty even though you had already drank a lot of water.  Beware you've been warned.",0
Food is okay but the line is always a minus point. Service are not very good and its a one time only place for me for the sake of the line.,0
"Joe's is just one of those places that you go to so that you can say you've been, so if you've never been, go. However, it was my second time here and I will not be returning. Constantly crowded and the rude staff does not help very much either. I wouldn't mind waiting if the food was mindblowing-ly delicious, or if the service was impeccable, but Joe's falls short on both accounts. Their dumplings are good, but there are soup dumpling places lined up and down Chinatown, you can definitely find a better place to fulfill your xiao long bao cravings.",0
"The line to get in was so long and it did not bring back the amazing memories of the last time we were in NYC 9 years ago. Nice dumplings and the okay Chinese food, but not what I remembered of the old venue.",0
"i'm vegetarian so i didn't get to try their soup dumplings and maybe if i had then it would have been a better experience. as it were, i got a pan-fried noodle (liang mian huang) which was noooothing like wut a liangmian huang is...i don't know if they ran out of noodles that day or what but the type of noodle they used (a thick, white, fried thing) was nothing at all like the light thin crispy egg noodles that the dish is supposed to be. sauce, tasteless and bland. this was my first experience with ""chinese"" food in nyc in a long time..disappointing. go to flushing instead for proper food (and dumplings) the only thing i liked about it was that we all had to share tables because it was so crowded, which is something you have to do in hong kong all the time.",0
"It's okay. I think this place is a bit overrated. I feel that the wait time to be seated could be long since it's well known and everyone comes. That aside, you might have to share tables (I don't mind but some might) and the space for all your food could be limited. Their food is like all other places I've been too.",0
"Was very disappointed when visited.  They use to have the best dumpling in town, but I guess no more.  It was nasty when I ordered it last time.",0
"Worst Chinese food I've had in a long time. Service was atrocious. Soup dumplings are just ok now. This place used to be great, but something happened when they moved locations. Stay away.",0
"Crazy busy, tight inside, shared table seating, but that does mean you get seated reasonably quickly despite the crowds.

Green beans are a little too much dried beef-- not delicate in taste as a result. Not bad though, but disappointing.

Xiao long bao in pork form are pretty decent, the pork and crab are even better, but the end product is just average. They lack the delicacy or the presentation of the better places I've had, and while the taste was pretty acceptable, the taste again lacked the explosive bursts of flavor on your taste buds of the best places.",0
"Eh.  I'm always glad when there is jellyfish as I guiltily love to eat it but overall it's pretty eh.  

Yay soup dumplings for pork eaters! They look finely crafted and bursting with flavor and juice.  
 
Not vegetarian friendly ( but that's to be expected at a dim sum place)

I guess I'm not eating the things everyone goes crazy for here- but I am a big fan of the genre/style/cuisine.",0
"For what it costs, the food is great. However, I've had better Chinese food and steamed pork dumplings elsewhere. If you've had the dumplings at Din Tai Fung in Southern California, then Joe's Shangai doesn't even compare.",0
came here when i was 10 with my family and fell in love with the soup dumplings. fast forward 10 years later.. it wasnt the same. really hoped for the same taste but was definitely lost throughout those 10 years.,0
"The place is sh*t. 
Waiters are rude and barely speak any English. 
There are some weird yells from the kitchen all the time. 
They don't accept credit cards.
The seating is cramped and you have to share table with 9 other people.
The place is quite dirty.
Food is average.
You'd be better off  by going to an other place.",0
"On our trip to NYC, we tried this restaurant with 4 stars and 4k reviews, which is not common for a Chinese restaurant. But to my taste, food was too oily. Maybe it is more traditional style, really original from Shanghai. We tried soup dumplings, fried sea bass, shredded beef and a vegetable dish. Not bad but too oily.",0
"Ok at best. 
The soup dumplings were good, but everything else was just meh. 
Atmosphere is like a cross between a diner and a Chinese restaurant.
Don't plan on a return visit that I do know.",0
"I've been here a handful of times and no doubt, this place is always packed!  Service is fast, food comes quick, and prices are fair, definitely one of the more popular places in Chinatown.  However, it has become more of a tourist spot rather than a locals eatery so it has slightly lost some of it's luster.  

Don't get me wrong, their XLBs (xiao long bao) were good, but I cannot say they're great.  We had 2 orders of the pork + 1 order of the crab and without a doubt, the pork one was definitely tastier.  Each dumpling was juicy and filled with great pork flavor.  However, the crab ones were a bit disappointing.  We found them too salty and seafood tasting.  Overall, I still prefer the XLBs from DTF better (hands down, probably still my favorite dumpling house).   

Aside from their XLBs, I found their green onion pancakes + Shanghai fried flat noodle to be rather tasty.  Both definitely had some great ""wok"" flavors...very authentic indeed.  

Come early or be prepared to wait!",0
"This place is a little out of the way from the subway. I took the 6 train to canal street but ending up having to walk all the way through chinatown for 10 or so minutes. And it is COLD (19 degrees and WIND). :(

But my friend and I were REALLY craving those soup dumplings. Just an FYI - for those who may be confused as I was - the soup dumplings are actually listed as Pork Steamed Buns on their menu. But everyone here refers to them as soup dumplings and so do the servers at the restaurant. I had to double check with him to make sure they were the same thing. 

Pretty much the first thing they ask you when you sit down is if you want the ""soup dumplings."" Which we got a tray of and they were ozzing with liquids... YUM! No matter how carefully I bit into the dumplings, the liquids squirted all over my shirt and pants. So probably not a FIRST DATE spot...

I also ordered the Beef Tendon Noodle soup and I was yearning for something HOT after the cold walk. The noodle soup was disappointing as it was not very favorable and the beef tendons were very tough and didn't taste fresh. But I guess I can't expect too much if the dish costs 5.95. 

They do add automatic 15% gratuity on the check and ONLY TAKE CASH so be prepared!!",0
"My first visit to NYC and through my brother's research on Yelp, it made it on our list of ""must eats"" while there.  Before I start on the slightly above average food, I must warn the clean freaks and germaphobes.  This might not be the place for you.  It's on the uncleanly side, has a kind of bearable stench to it and bathroom was completely filthy with urine covered floor decor, dirty walls and the stench in there moves over to the unbearable side.    

And now to the food.  The famous soup dumplings were good.  I've had soup dumplings before and have had better.  We had both the crab and the pork.  I thought the pork was much better.  The crab had a slight fishy, unfresh smell and taste to it.  Not overwhelming by any means.  We had the Singapore Noodles, House Special fried rice (forgot the name), Shanghai flat noodles (fried) and they were all excellent.  We had some other protein dishes that were good.  My only complaint would be the steamed fish we had.  It tasted very fishy.  That usually tells me it's not fresh.  I couldn't tell if it would have been good because the fishiness (I think that's a word) was overpowering, especially in a steaming preparation where the flavors are mild.

Service was ok, but the hostess was rude and horrible.  We had a table of 12 and were told 10 minutes and it was well over an hour.  It was totally a scene out of the Seinfeld Chinese Restaurant episode.  They were seating people out of order and when we tried to get the hostess to ask her about our table, she would flat out ignore us as if she didn't speak a word of english (not racist because I'm asian too and so is my wife and friends that were waiting with me... plus she did speak perfect english).  But overall, food was good.",0
I think the 5 stars is a scam horrible food horrible service c on the cleanliness the ginger chicken was bland the dumplings were without flavor I have had much better dumplings in smaller lesser rated places,0
Meh.  Nothing special.  The soup dumplings were thick and chewy and very awkward to eat.  The ratio of meat to broth was off (too heavy on the meat in my opinion).  I like a smaller soup dumpling (like Yank Sing in SF).  Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings don't even come close to the deliciousness and perfection of their Yank Sing brethren.  Oh and to top it off the last dumpling that my husband bit into was garnished with a loooong black hair.  I'm a blonde.  Check please!,0
"The only worthwhile thing to order here are the dumplings.  Everything else was disappointing:

[[ Peking Style Minced Pork Noodle ]] - According to the Chinese characters on the menu, this is ""zha jiang mian"", which is a Northern Chinese dish of ground pork with black bean paste.  Koreans even have a version of this black bean noodle.  It's so popular in Korean culture that they even have an 'instant' version of this: Chapagetti, which is pretty darn spot-on to the Chinese & Korean version of this.  Anyway, the point of all of this is that I love this dish when it's prepared right.  It was NOT prepared correctly here at all.  I don't even think there was pork in this dish.  There was a lot of finely diced firm tofu, but where was the pork...??

[[ Mapo tofu ]] - Also another unauthentic dish.  The flavor was not bad, but it was definitely lacking any spice at all.  It just was NOT mapo tofu.  The pork was also very minimal in this dish as well. 

[[ Xiao long bao ]] - The infamous Shanghai ""soup"" dumplings.  Yes.  They really are that good.  The skin is perfect: thin enough so that you don't feel overwhelmed by skin, but thick enough so that the broth doesn't spill out.  The broth was flavorful and plentiful, not too salty.  I would recommend getting the pork buns and NOT the crab ones.  It's not worth the extra $.  To me, the crab/pork mixture tasted kinda weird.  To my tablemates, they couldn't even tell that there was crab in them.  Additionally, it seemed that for whatever reason, the crab/pork dumplings seemed to have less broth in them.  

Overall the dumplings get 5/5 stars.  The other two dishes get 2/5 stars.  (I guess you get sub-par Chinese food when 90% of the customers are non-Asian.)  The service was alright, and our group of 4 got seated right away on a Monday night, so no complaints there.  You will get seated with strangers at a table, and they don't take credit cards at all (no matter how much you spend), which seems a little shady/antiquated to me, but hey, this is Chinatown, and they've got no shortage of business.",0
"Food - Meh. 
Service - Eek!

Xiao Long Bao aka soup dumplings are huge and fatty. They tasted alright.  The pork fried noodles are okay.

We had really wanted another type of noodle but the waiter pretended not to understand us and really couldn't be bothered with us for longer than 20 seconds.  If he hadn't made us feel dumb we would have ordered more dishes and beer.

I will never take Din Tai Fung for granted.",0
"I went here years ago --- when it was good. I don't think it's up to par anymore. The soup dumplings are os os (I had better). In my opinion, so don't rip on me, I believer there are other places that make it a bit better --- quality-wise. Joe Shanghai is officially a tourist spot --- in my book. Services are crap-tac-u-lar and a heads up --- the tips are included in the meal. Meh. Eh. Blah. Boo.",0
"NOTICE TO ALL NEW people's who never been here : BEWARE DO NOT come here. I saw the review over 4K and 4+ or so Star figure it should be a good place .... NOT!!!!! Extremely disappointed and NOT happy. I Don't know why the life of me it even have customers only possible reason is cause the LIE Fake review they have for this place.

4: RUDE , Disrespectful, Horrible Service, watch Your Bills or you will get cheated. 
Food wise it not worth it. Fried rice is plain tasteless fried pork chop is dry and plain no taste. Overall their food isn't anything worthwhile or good. Their dumplings which was all the hyped review is NOT worth the attitude and service YOU get from them. So Beware People's DO Not come here !!! Do not give them your business!!!",0
"Had dinner at Joe's Shanghai on Saturday night. A shorter wait without our number being skipped, and a more refined order would have left me happier with the results.

Quality: They are known for their soup dumplings and they lived up to the hype. I thought the Crab Meat Soup Dumplings were superior to the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings, but both were delicious. The Pork Fried Dumplings were also great and should be ordered. I was not a fan for the thick and doughy Scallion Pancake. I also could have skipped the General Tso's Chicken, it was fine, but not one of the better iterations I have had. The Chicken Fried Rice was bad, bland, terrible rice, and the chicken was sad. The Crispy Shredded Beef was the only larger dish we ordered that I was excited about, the texture is unique and the flavor is wonderful.
Quantity: Large portions, order less than you need or expect lots of leftovers.
Value: $7 for a Scallion Pancake. $14 for Crab Meat Soup Dumplings. $12 for Pork Meat Soup Dumplings. $12 for Pork Fried Dumplings. $23 for General Tso's Chicken. $23 for Crispy Shredded Beef. $15 for Chicken Fried Rice.
Ambiance: Joe's Shanghai is located in Chinatown. The space is large, but very simple. There is little decor, a few paintings and pictures, however nothing that seems like it was purposely designed. The place is filled with tables, which are ready to be turned over quickly. Staff will hover when they realize you are done to get everything cleared and the next guests in. They kept the doors ajar, which meant a cold restaurant after a cold wait outside.
Crowd: No reservations and crowds will gather. Expect over an hour wait during primetime.
Service: The number system for a table is terrible, and we had to inquire after it became clear they skipped over us. Things move fast when you sit down.
Parking: Tough street parking, but lots of trains nearby.",0
"For the best xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) in NYC, head over to Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown.  These tasty morsels will keep you coming back to this hole-in-the-wall where famous not-so regular Joe still takes your order.

"Dumplings is 5 star delicious. But since I'm reviewing the restaurant as a whole I would say this is at best a 3 star. First of all, they make you share tables! You will not get your own table if you are in groups of 2 or 3. I find that kind of tacky but they have long lines all the time so they don't care if you leave. The food was very good. Had the kung pao chicken and also lots of dumplings and yu choy. I think the presentation of the restaurant and cleaniness can be improved. They only care about making money and the best way is to fill every seat in the restaurant!",0
"Wow, I really don't understand the hype. Using shanghai cafe as a direct comparison, I left feeling sorry for the couple that were forced to sit at a large round table with us. They were told to come here from the recommendation of Lonely Planet. These tourists were from the UK. After trying some XLBs, they sheepishly asked us why for such a popular place the dumplings were so disappointing. In fact, their poor experience only validated the authenticity of the restaurants they frequent. 

We were equally disappointed. Our waiter had a weird habit of stopping by the table right as your seated to insist you order dumplings. It's a bit uncomfortable considering we hadn't even gotten our jackets off and barely had time to open the menu. Nevertheless we came here specifically to try the dumplings so we weren't phased. The dumplings are larger than others but that doesn't make up for the sad state of soup on the inside. It's thick and dark, as if the soup sat too long and started congealing. We were planning to order two but thankfully we stopped short. 

We also decided to try the salt and pepper pork chops. This is a simple enough dish but they couldn't even get that right.

Don't fall for this tourist trap.

"A typical Chinese eatery, that has become famous for its soup dumplings. There's lines of people out the door, and it's a cash only establishment.

While the soup dumplings are pretty good, the main thing is that they're cheap! $7 gets you 8 soupy dumps. Now I'm no mathematician, but i make that 0.87c a dumpling, which isn't half bad. 

The rest of the food is relatively standard for what you'd expect for a chinese restaurant - it includes all the staples such as general Tso's, black bean etc. 

The place doesn't take reservations, so if you come with a group, chances are you're in for a wait! As I say, the dumplings are good, but it's only 3 stars for me because I don't think the dumplings are so good that it's worth the wait. I'd much recommend going to Jing Fong (which again, has decent soup dumplings for the price, but probably no wait).",0
"I'm a pretty big fan of shanghainese food and xiao long bao, but this place sucked big time. 

The beef pan fried noodles sucked. The sauce was overly salted, but yet there wasn't enough to spread onto the noodles.

The shanghai lo mein sucked really bad. It was bland... almost as bad as my moms cooking on a bad day. It was just bad... Nothing special.

The xiao long bao's were nothing special either.

Three calls to get water.

Originally I wanted to go to Shanghai Manor a few blocks away but I ended up eating here cause they close early. It definitely does not compare. Obviously you could tell most Asians would not eat here, their audience is mainly white people, some doing late night take out, others being tourist. Do yourself a favor and eat some actual good shanghainese food, seriously.",0
Dumping was amazing and really good.  I ordered fish dish too take a bit long. But ok.  I did not like service  waiter not care customer any more,0
Good XLB (soup dumplings) with lots of soup and flavors. Not overly sweet like most places but be ready for a long wait and share table with strangers. Packed and loud like most Chinese places. Good for the price but a little over rated in my opinion.,0
"Cash only! Hope y'all don't mind sharing tables!

Joe's Shanghai was recommended to me by pretty much everyone when it came to visting Chinatown in NYC. Upon arrival, there was a short 15 minute wait, typical of lunch time in many Chinese restaurants, especially on the weekends. 

Apparently Joe's is known for their dumplings, as evidenced by dumpling cages (those bamboo baskets used to steam dumplings) on everyone's table. So following suit, we ordered the same. 8 good sized dumplings, the size of those noodle soup spoons for roughly $6 was a pretty good deal. In addition we ordered beef noodle soup and crispy pork chops with salt and pepper. 

For two we spent just about $30 for lunch. The restaurant's turnover was quick, so don't be afraid of the line. The food was good, but I was a little disappointed because nothing really popped out at me. I've had a lot of chinese food and unfortunately, Joe's Shanghai was just another chinese restaurant. The great thing however, was that we shared tables with other customers which gave us an opportunity to mingle with New Yorkers and other visitors. 

Overall Joe's Shanghai was a great deal for lunch (for 2) and provided the right ambiance and experience when visiting Chinatown in NYC.",0
"The place here is pretty big. Took two stars off because the service was terrible, not that I was expecting amazing service in chinatown and all the plates, cups were really dirty. Make sure to watch your bill too because they will charge you more than what you got. The food itself was decent:

Singapore Mein Fun: was better than a lot of the places I have been too. I think I like this the most. The noodle was really flavor and not to spicy.

Pork & Crab Dumpling: I think shanghai manner's soup dumpling is way better. The skin is really thick, but the soup dumpling was big. There isn't a lot of soup in the dumpling either. I probably would not get this here

Spring Roll: Very oily and is not good. Taste frozen.

Hot & Sour Soup: The flavor was really good, but they add weird stuff to it. Like pork blood and intestines. 

Probably wouldn't come back because of how dirty the plates were. If you can't even wash your plates and cup, do you even clean anything in the kitchen?",0
"So my boyfriend had been raving about this place for so long before actually coming here, and we finally had the chance to come here during a trip to New York with a buddy.. Although the food was okay, the customer service was absolutely horrible. We each ordered one order of dumplings each and after waiting about 30-45 for our food and seeing multiple people around us who came in after got their food before us we finally decided to ask them about our food. My boyfriend then asks our waiter about our order and our waiter is completely rude and just says wait, nothing else. We keep waiting and waiting then after five mins ask someone else and this person just flat us ignores us, then we finally ask this girl at the counter for a manager and eventually get our food and they still forget one of our orders. This place might be great to some but my first impression after hearing so many good things about their food and coming from California absolutely sucked. Maybe they think because they already have so many good reviews they don't need to keep up with their appearance, but they should also realize people from all over the country visit New York and ""hot spots"" in New York and they should treat every one of their customers with respect, especially if they can't even get an A (they had a B rating). They also include the tip in your tab, so more of a reason to give you really bad quality customer service because there's no way I would've tipped this waiter.",0
"I do not understand the positive reviews. The food has no flavor, including the soup dumplings. Bland food, poor customer service (had to ask 3 times for water to go with our meal). They serve a pot of tea that is so hot it cannot be drank until long after the meal is over. The waiters could not care less about how they treat their customers because they add 15% gratuity to all orders.  The entire experience was a waste of time and money.",0
"Extremely overrated. We're from San Francisco where excellent Chinese Restaurants are a plenty. The dishes were okay, but nothing stood out. Maybe we should have ordered the soup dumplings. We ordered the Fried Sea Bass, Fried Rice, Scallion Pancakes, and Sesame Chicken. Our teenager liked the Sesame Chicken. Everything was edible but nothing stood out. Service was curt, (which we don't mind as long as the food is good) The prices of the dishes don't pair with the overall flavor of the dishes. The ambiance was actually nice  due to the big family groups dining the same time as us. You can hear the subway rumbling by. (Which we liked. It gave the place an interesting vibe. Another group did not) AND they are cash only. There's a BofA close by and they have an ATM. Their bathrooms were clean.",0
"Beware if you're coming here that you are okay with waiting because this place is PACKED.  They do have famous soup dumplings so there are a lot of tourist.  A lot of there tables are huge so be prepared to share tables with people. you will not really have much table space. I think for people who are not expecting this, the sharing table experience can be awful.  It is so fast paced there.  If you're looking for good service, this is not the place to come.  Only come here if you really really really want soup dumplings.  They are actually extremely delicious! If it's just chinese food you''re craving then go somewhere else and avoid the wait. It is definitely not my scene. It is too rowdy but if I'm craving dumplings I might have to stop in.",0
"Hmmm ive been here a few times in the past, usually a long wait esp popular with non-Chinese,  would have given it 3 stars except my last experience was just not good...

hot & sour soap.. too thick and barely warm
rice cake.. GREASY
service.. well first bowl was not clean.. second bowl was not clean...",0
"Tourist trap! It's overpriced, with a terrible atmosphere and the food is mediocre. The soup dumplings were okay, but that could be because I don't have anything to compare them to. And to top off the whole experience, our waiter was picking his nose while taking our order! I really don't understand the hype. I get better food from my local Chinese take out.",0
"We were tourists, just like anybody else in there, I'm sure. The best thing we got there was the ""Pork Xiao Long Bao"" otherwise known as dumplings in the basket. My boyfriend and I have been eating the dumplings wrong, because right when we saw other people eat theirs, they used a spoon and put the dumplings on to savour the soup and eat it with the dumplings.

This is how you're supposed to eat the Pork Xiao Long Bao for those who haven't ever tried it.
Step 1: Place the dumpling on your soup spoon.
2: Place it in your mouth or if you can't fit it entirely in your mouth, use your chopsticks and eat half of the dumpling and the juice will come spilling out on your spoon, but that is the good part, so you don't want to waste it!
3: Enjoy the deliciousness! 

The only cons there is the service and seating arrangements.
Service: When you first walk in and are seated, they automatically give you hot tea. I asked for water 4 times from 4 different servers and finally the last server gave me water. Service is terrible and tip is already included into your bill.

Seating arrangements: Luckily for me, I read from other Yelp reviewers that I may be seated with strangers at a table of 10. If I hadn't read that, I'd be freaking out like ""why am i seated with strangers? I don't know these people!"" We ended up sitting next to 2 other parties on the same table. Kinda awkward since you can't have a private conversation with the person you're with without being heard from others. Luckily I speak a 2nd language that nobody on my table speak. haha.",0
"I'm not going to lie, I went in with very high expectations. I was wondering around Chinatown in NYC for the first time this past Sunday and passed by a huge line of people and I wanted to know what they were waiting for. 

Low and behold it was Joe's Shanghai. The place that everyone, including myself, have wanted to go for a long time. The line was too long so I went back on Monday when it opened. No one was in line and it was glorious. 

I walk in sit down and order the green onion pancake (a classic) and the crab meat filled dumpling. The service was pretty slow. It took me a while to get the attention of any waiter, it seemed like they were training a few of them. 

When the green onion pancake came, I was somewhat disappointed. It was a bit doughy in the middle but wasn't super crisp on the outside. I was even more disappointed with the soup dumpling. There was barely any soup in it. Even when one broke over the bamboo steamer it comes in, almost no soup came out. 

Maybe I came on an off day, but after talking to my local NYC friends, they said Joe's Shanghai is decent, but not great.",0
Good food. I can't wait to go back to NYC again as I will make sure this is on my itinerary. An added bonus we met great people at our communal table.,0
"I was pretty disappointed during my experience. I'm here on vacation from Miami, & came here because all of the reviews and the 4 stars.

First things first....community seating. Myself and the company with me, waited 30 minutes to get our own table, which by the way, the staff made us wait outside in the rain until our table was ready. 

Let's talk about food. The dumplings were alright, nothing crazy. I had sesame chicken which was a bit pink AND, it was just the chicken...no rice, which I thought was odd. Food wasn't that great, the only thing we liked was the tea and the orange slices that they automatically serve.

Not returning.",0
"Joe's is a Chinatown favorite and a go-to restaurant for a lot of New Yorkers and tourists alike. The soup dumplings are really good and perhaps the main reason why anyone should go here. Other entrees are good too, not great or standing out but not bad. My qualm is that all the soup dumplings contain pork. They don't have any with chicken beef or just seafood.",0
"Joe's was SO disappointing!  I was surprised my foodie friends said that was their favorite and comparable to Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, CA.  I don't mind the location; I don't mind the lines; I don't mind sharing a table with strangers.  I DO mind flavorless, oily soup dumplings.

The skin was thicker than I'd have liked.  The soup inside was more fat than broth and the meat was forgettable.  Ok, I'm ragging on their dumplings, which was disappointing after all the hype, but the other food was pretty good.  The hot and sour soup wasn't bad.  The pan friend potstickers were meh.  The beef noodle soup was AWESOME as are the cold sesame noodles, which had the perfect ""bouncy"" texture when you chew it.

The prices are also something to rave about.  Between 5 of us, we ordered 5 baskets of XLB, 1 crab XLB, hot and sour soup, beef noodles, sesame noodles,  and pot stickers for a grand total of around $80 including tax.

Overall, I'm glad they weren't that good since NY is much farther than a simple 6 hr drive to Din Tai Fung in LA for me. ;)",0
"I have now come to the decision that Joe's Shanghai is inedible. There's so much fat in the soup, it's disgusting. We also ordered green beans and they were really thick, almost as thick as asparagus. I can not come back here again. Not even for visiting friends.",0
"I'm a sucker for hype...I need to know if it is true

The soup dumplings are good, at least four stars for the price...

However, two main issues: the server forgot my beer twice, and the place needs to be ventilated so it is not so sour smelling.

The pancake was excellent, but that's not hard to make 

The jelly fish was like bland fresh seaweed 

Wine chicken reminded me of good Hainan chicken(minus the garlic)...steamed, cold, juicy.",0
"3.5 stars: their soup dumplings are okay, nothing spectacular. The first review I read was a huge turnoff - sanitation of the restaurant is a C. But what should we be expecting from a Chinese restaurant, right? 

Onto their soup dumplings... it's just regular soup dumplings. The skin is not as rigid or dry as other soup dumplings I've tried before which deserves a thumbs up. The crab soup dumplings were pretty fishy and the regular pork soup dumplings tasted mediocre. 

Along with their soup dumplings, we ordered eggplant and fried dumplings. I don't recommend the eggplant. The exterior was flavorful but when you chewed on it, the garlic flavor was gone and you're left with plain eggplant taste. Fried dumplings are also mediocre. 

Not sure why Joe's Shanghai has over 4k reviews. I'm guessing it was one of the few soup dumpling restaurant to open up back in the days. If you're really in the mood of soup dumplings and want the most of out your money then come here. Otherwise, there are better options.",0
We went to this place for a company holiday dinner. I my self love Chinese food and get even more excited it the peace is a pretty well know spot. This wasn't something for me to get excited for. The food is ok... not bad or anything just nothing that made me want to come back again and try. If you are in the area check it out but don't make a night of it.,0
"I really liked it here and it was great food but nothing that i went crazy over and need to come back for. The service was also terrible

Steamed buns - these are the soup dumplings. They were really good and fill with a delicious broth (but hard to eat) 

Flat noodles - dont be deceived these are not actually flat, they are lo mein on steroids (really think lo mein). They were solid chinese noodles, but did have much flavor 

Crispy shredded beef - these were like all those little crispy pieces that get left at the bottom of the general tsos box. I loved them!! It was flavorful and crispy yum. We added these to the noodles and it was actually an awesome combination i recommend trying this. 

Kung pao chicken - really flavorful with a ton of peanuts. I added extra chili sauce and it was awesome that way

General tso chicken - it was good, but pretty standard

Crispy spicy prawns in meat sauce - dont be scared by the meat sauce im not really sure what that means but its basically crispy fried shrimp with a spicy thick general tso sauce on top- these were really good as well

Service - we called in advance and asked if it was byo and they said yes. As soon as we got there they said we are not allowed to byo - thats fine but they shouldnt have told us yes on the phone that made me annoyed. They then seemed annoyed at everything we were asking them and like we were a burden to them. At the end, they were staring at us and basically asked us to leave. There are a lot of good chinese places in the city so no need to come back here",0
"My date was really excited to bring me here for the ""best dumplings in NYC"" and being a fat kid at heart I was excited to try them.  We arrive to a group of people waiting outside for their number to be called.  Turns out you have to get a number, DMV style.  We were told the wait would be about 30 minutes, so we got foot massages across the street.  Came back after half an hour and were told it would be about 35 minutes... seriously?  So no big deal, we walk around go into some shops and return.  Now it's our fault we left when they called our number.  So we stand for about 10 minutes extra and finally get seated at a family round table with a lazy Susan in the center. If only there were a device that would light up or buzz when your table was ready...  Anyhow, ok we are in, great! Except these amazing dumplings all contain pork and that is the one thing I do not eat.  Wtf, really?  So I get some of their non dumpling selections and they seem pretty good, 'not so bad' I think (shudder).The bill arrives and the place is cash-only.  To put the entire experience to bed, walking out the health inspection grade is a B hidden by inner entrance away from all the Zagat highly acclaimed reviews.  Sure enough on the walk to a late night drink my stomach was not happy.  Will NOT return.  NYC is too big to not have better dumplings, and there are definitely better Chinese dishes, plenty of options that will NOT make you sick even better if you hit the outer boroughs like Flushing in Queens.  If you don't have an iron stomach, just pass on this.  You're welcome.",0
The place was crowded and the food was okay. The only good thing we got were the crab dumplings.,0
"-long lines at peak hours(naturally)
-great crab meat/pork dumplings that explodes with juice
-ate the shanghai noodles there as well which was really good
-be prepared to sit with strangers at a big table to expedite service
-don't expect a long drawn out meal...this place is all about customer turnover",0
"This was my third time here. In the past the food has been phenomenal hence why I've came back. But this time, it wasn't great. The fried rice and scallion pancakes were just as good as I remember. 

However, the soup dumplings (ordered both crabmeat and pork combo and pork soup dumplings) had hard bits of chewy meat. The overall soup component was not very flavorful and required a lot of vinegar, spice, and soy sauce. 

The crispy shredded beef was good but not great- again, lacking flavor dimension. 

The staff is always so nice here & honest about their recommendations on what to order. Food always comes out in a timely manner. It's always really busy so make sure you come and expect a bit of a wait!",0
Total tourist trap. The signature crab and pork dumplings are ok but definitely not great. The worst part is the MANDATORY service charge on top of which they tried to get away with stealing some extra for themselves but not giving back our change! Don't waste your time unless you are too intimidated to go anywhere else in Chinatown.,0
"A few friends and I went to Joe's this past weekend because we'd heard so much about it over the past year. We ordered up a bunch of dishes and decided to pass them around family style so that we could all share and taste each others' dishes. As expected, the soup dumplings were tasty... and interesting (because I had never had them before). However, most of the rest of what we tried was just okay. The only other stand out was the seafood noodles (not the crunchy ones but the soft ones). These were extra tasty!

As for atmosphere, the place is pretty much a dive. And, be prepared to wait if you wanna hit Joe's. The tourists know about the place, and the come in droves!",0
"Well... a major let down. The place is a total hustle. Their only goal is to get you in and then for you to order as quickly as possible and get the hell out even quicker!! The food was less than tasty... service pretty scrappy... would never go back again.

All those stars on Yelp... have to be a bunch of hired hands dating them highly.",0
"Overrated in everything.  We tried four dishes: the Shanghai noodle bowl, the spring roll, the General Tso's chicken, and Szechuan beef noodle bowl.  The dishes weren't good and were expensive.  The service was bad.  On top of that, they automatically charged 15% on top of our bill and DID NOT give the right change back....they overcharged me $10. BEWARE of this bad practice as they only take cash and there is no proof of deception.",0
"I never had to wait in line because I got here at 11am sharp on a Sunday! We got a table for 4 immediately and already knew what we wanted to order Xiao Long Bao of course!  We tried every soup dumpling there was on the menu and my favorite one was the crab an pork dumplings. I like how these soup dumplings were super juicy and the broth was tasty. Price is VERY reasonable-$6.95! In CALI, they charge $8.95 so we indulged when we came to Joe's! 

Quick Tip: Cash only!",0
"Please eat somewhere else!

We chose to eat here because of the reviews. They seat you at a table with strangers, so it is a very uncomfortable eating situation. Staff ignores you when you say, ""Excuse me,"" when you are asking for help. I asked a hostess for a fork, and she said, ""Ask a waiter."" I told her they ignore me, and she said, ""I'm not a waiter,"" instead of helping me get a fork! The air of the restaurant makes you feel like the staff is in a hurry to turn tables as quickly as possible without any Importance placed on customer service.

You can get equally as good food at any other place in Chinatown I've been to, and much better customer service and dining accommodations.",0
"When deciding to go to Joe's Shanghai, I think part of the appeal is the dining experience and its reputation.  You enter a bustling restaurant where there's usually a lengthy line of people waiting to get seated, and there's something about being at a place that is in seeming high demand that can make your meal more exciting.  Joe's Shanghai is probably one of the better known restaurants in Chinatown, so be prepared for a wait!

Overall, my most recent meal was just average.  The soup dumplings were definitely the best parts of the meals.  I tried the crab and pork variety, and while I did not taste the crab in the filling, I thought it was a savory delight.  I also tried the pork fried rice and sautéed Chinese broccoli, and while I appreciated the freshness of the broccoli, I thought the fried rice was mediocre.  

Would Joe's Shanghai be my go-to destination for Chinese food in NYC? Probably not, but I think it's worth a visit to see what the hype is all about.",0
"Always a long line of mostly tourists but the food is not what it used to be!
Service is hurried and too crazy.
Success has its negative sides.
Only the dumplings are OK.",0
"Oh my god, seriously? Who said this is one of the best Chinese restaurant in NYC? He must never have real Chinese food. All dishes we got are awful. First time eating here, and last time too.",0
"I love the juice buns that explode in your mouth.

But its not worth the wait (there are usually long lines just when I feel like having an explosion in my mouth!)....

Also, they are now way over-priced.  

When they first opened they were way above average.  Now, its an overrated tourist attraction.

Guess I'll be going on the mouth-exploding dumpling quest elsewhere.",0
"Planning my trip to NYC, everyone's suggestion was to try Joe's Shanghai. My friend and I went on a Saturday and this place was packed. We got there around 12ish and didn't get seated till almost 1pm for two people. This place is small and cramped. When our number finally got called we had to wait another 8 minute to get sat. The way they seat people is also very interesting. A group can be sat together with other parties at a round table. Fortunately, my friend and I got our own table right next to the ""drink bar"". It was not the best location and very cramped. We were so close to the table next to us, that we felt we were eating with them. The worst part about our table, was that we could see how they handled the drinks and noticed they aren't very clean. Btw, they did have a letter ""B"" in their window. We ignored it due to the many recommendation. The staff worked like a machine. They just turned tables over and over. It was a typical Chinese restaurant where they did not communicate well and just in a rush. 
We ordered the typical Pork soup dumpling and I then learned why it was such a popular suggestion. They are pretty big and very soupy. The wrapper was was soft and the soup just the right amount of flavor. My favorite part of eating the soup dumpling was the dipping sauce. It brought the flavor to a new level with a little bit of tart and sourness. Along with the dumplings we order salt and pepper pork chops. For two people we were full after eating the dumplings and the portions for the pork chops was a lot. The pork chop was okay for me. I have better. It was a little on the saltier side and the breading wasn't crispy enough for me. The dipping sauce they provide is sweet and sour sauce. I preferred dipping it in the soy/vinegar sauce that they use for the dumpling. We ordered two portions of rice. If you are not a big rice eater, one portion is way more than enough for two people. 
After this experience, I don't really know if I will be back. If i do decide to come back, it will probably be for take out and only the soup dumplings. It is definitely an experience. The pricing were also reasonable since it is family style.",0
"Soup dumplings are delicious! Not as good as Din Tai Fung but not too shabby. 
Green beans were really good, almost like finger food that we couldn't stop popping.  Green onion pancake was crispy,  thicker and breaded. Pretty delicious. 
The service is quick.",0
Overhyped IMO- got the soup dumplings and the sweet and sour soup. The sweet and sour soup had a strong vinegary taste while the soup dumplings were better tasting,0
I think this will be my last visit to Joes. The skin of the soup dumplings are thinner and theres a lot of soup... only plus. Do not try the pan fried noodles! The noodles look and taste like styrofoam and the sauce makes it worse.,0
"The food really does live up to the fame. However, the service is always the downfall. They pack the restaurant where it is simply uncomfortable to sit. There is no room and I always fear things being spilled on me. The worst experience was when I was with a group of friends, and the waiter kept leaning on my friend's chair when he was waiting around. When we finished our meal and he was bringing out the oranges, he spilled juice down my friend's back. If you want good Shanghai food, this is the place to go, but be warned that it is extremely crowded, noisy, and the service may be lousy. For me, I prefer going down the block to Joe's Ginger. Relatively the same without the cramped space.",0
"We were not fans of this place at all. It's a dank restaurant in Chinatown, except there's a lot of hype about the food, which I don't understand at all. 

We had the soup dumplings, the fried noodle dish, shrimp fried rice, and what was supposed to be this rice noodle stir fry dish (it turned out to be egg noodles). Everything tasted fine but was so overly greasy that I had a film of grease outside of my mouth. After biting into a soup dumpling, I had a mouthful of pork grease. Service was terrible, and we had to ask for water a couple of times. 

There prices weren't great, the food wasn't good, and the service was awful. Definitely not worth going out of your way for.",0
"If Joe's Shanghai represents the quintessential East Coast xiao long bao restaurant, then I would definitely give the award to Din Tai Fung on the West Coast. 

Why, you ask?

Granted that Joe's xiao long baos are larger, however

- The dumpling skin was too thick
- Soup inside the dumpling tasted like it had MSG or was a bit salty
- After being uncovered for 5-10 mins, the dumpling skin became rubbery and the soup congealed...ewww

All of this makes for a bad dumpling. 

We also had the onion pancake which was OK and the lion's head meatballs were decent, although too large too finish.

Next time in New York, I'd like to travel to Brooklyn to try The Good Fork's dumplings as seen on ""Throwdown with Bobby Flay"".",0
"The soup dumplings are great (but only the pork), and everything else is sub-par. Have been twice, and that's once too much.",0
"Pretty decent soup dumplings! 

Pretty much always a wait and it's filled with tourists. You sit family style, round table with strangers unless you have a full party to fill a table. 

The rest of the food is OK. It's not expensive and there are a few good bars not too far away. (Apotheke - speakeasy)",0
"FLIES IN THE FOOD. I used to frequent Joe's Shanghai over 4 years ago but this location suffers from quality and service. In the past, it was fine that the service was awful since the food was good but I waited over an hour and a half, like many others on Pell street, for soup dumplings with little to no soup in them. Go somewhere else, service is awful and they weren't apologetic at all when they moved the fly around and spread its wings in my bok choy. Yaso Tangbao in BK is much better with solid xiao long bao.",0
"We stood in line for 45 minutes to be seated. We read the reviews and were very excited about this place but let's just say we've had much better food in Chinatown. Scallion pancakes were delicious, but pork dumpling soup was dry on the outside and bland on the inside. Pecking duck was our biggest disappointment. More than half of it was just fat. We didn't even eat a third of it. Unfortunately, I don't recommend this place.",0
"The Great: 
- Great for big groups. We came here with a table of 14 and were able to order a ton of food and each ended up paying around $25. 
- The scallion pancakes are amazing
- Crispy chicken

The OK/good: 
- soup dumplings - a little too big, but generally good. Could have more of the meat flavor. I crave soup dumplings, but not necessarily Joe's. 

The bad:
- a little dirty. But..hey...it is New York.",0
"Meh...that's my vote. It's def not 4-5 star worthy and more akin to a tourist trap. Famous soup dumplings had good soup, but meat wasn't the freshest I've ever had. The skin was more doughy than should be and not the lighter consistency it should be. Hot and sour soup came out cold, had to be reheated via microwave. So overall, very average and you might as well go to any other Shanghainese place in Chinatown without the long wait. My only consolation is that we didn't wait for seats cause we came midweek.",0
"Food was mediocre and our waiters were not very nice. Don't order the shredded pork noodle-- that was bad. Crispy duck was too salty. I liked the dumplings and pan fried noodles though. Overall, I did not really enjoy it here even though I love Chinese food.",0
"Overall, just had a pretty awful meal here. The soup dumplings are pretty good (by no means best in NYC, although certainly solid) but the rest of the food is BAD -- greasy, gloppy, americanized Chinese food. Everything we ordered had the same, one-note, brown-sauce flavor. In a city (and a neighborhood) filled with such amazing food, I'm shocked to see such an overwhelming amount of positive reviews for this incredibly mediocre restaurant. You're so much better going to a place like Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles for this kind of food, or a dim sum hall like Jing Fong for spectacular Chinese. Finally, I'd like to note that this place is cash-only (which is bullshit) and overpriced, too.

Point being: Don't go here.",0
"Soup dumplings were really good. Everything else was meh. Restaurant is small, but that's typical in new York.  We came on a day that was pouring raining and the place was still packed. Lucky for us, the wait for a table was only five minutes (probably bc there was only two of US). We shared a table with two other couples.",0
"I was expecting more considering the reviews . It is a touristic place , food is not bad but the overall atmosfere is too noise",0
We ate here and it wasn't worth all the hype. We waited for over hour and the dumplings were alright. It was to bready and not enough flavor. I definitely think there are other better places in NY.,0
"This place is so hyped up but I didn't really find it to be that great. 
There was a line of people before it opened and I'm trying to figure out why. 

The dumplings were not sturdy, some of them had holes when they were brought out. They stuck to the steamer despite the layer of lettuce underneath. They fell apart on contact with chopsticks. I saw many old Asian folks and none of them had dumplings on their table. 
The scallion pancakes were doughy and nothing special at all. 
The pork dumplings (or pork buns as written on the menu) were better than the pork and crab ones. 
Points for having water spinach because my friend tells me they don't usually even have it in restaurants because it's a hassle to prepare for cooking. 

Just a Note: 
The hostess's wear white,
The busser's wear yellow,
The waiters wear red, 
and the higher ups wear green.
No one is friendly and no one smiles.

It seems that majority of the time you have to share a table with complete strangers which depending on your personality is horrific or a cool opportunity. 

The music was all over the place jumping from authentic oriental sounds to mainstream Chinese music to the backstreet boys to Celine Dion to club music. 

Aim the words of another customer I met standing in line, you go in and they basically want you done and out right away. It's not a place to sit and eat and socialize, just consume the food and bounce.

If you have dumpling cravings this place will satisfy it but don't go in expecting something phenomenal because it will fall short.  It's a fine place to visit if you're in the area but certainly don't travel out of your way for it!",0
"If you have never been to Shanghai, China then Joe's Shanghai is pretty alright. But for anyone that has traveled abroad and tasted the real deal, Joe's is a complete let down.

The ""Xiao Long Bao"" that Joe serves is what they actually call ""Tan Bao"" which translates to soup dumpling. Xiao Long Bao in essense is a fraction of the size of the soup dumplings that Joe serves to consumers.

With that out of the way. The actual taste of the 'soup dumplings"" is mediocre at best. 1) the skin should be tender, almost the texture of soup wonton wraps, smooth. Joe does not deliver, the skin is tough and texture is rough. 2) the inside should not be overly flavored, the taste of the soup inside should be clean, clear, and resembles a good pork broth. Joe again does not deliver, the soup is a bit oily and overly flavored with other ingredients. Another negative is the color of the soup.

All in all, advertising the product as Xiao Long Bao's is a misrepresentation of what it actually is, soup dumplings (translated). 

Oh yea, I won't even speak about the rest of the menu, the crowded uncomfortable atmosphere, and rude wait staff.

P.S. Din Tai Fung might be an alternative to Joe's Shanghai, but even that place doesn't come close to the real deal.",0
"Mmm... don't know what to say about Joe's Shanghai. I'm not sure why but Joe's Shanghai is one of the most popular Shanghainese restaurants in NYC. Perhaps the media attention (Zagat, food magazines, etc.), but I don't think it's all it's hyped up to be.

They're almost always busy and their service isn't great. 
Their xiao long baos (soup dumplings) aren't really crazy great either. They were actually quite dried out with little soup last time I had them. Prices are okay. 

To be honest I'd rather go around the corner and up the block where I won't have to wait an hour for a table and be served hot fresh soup dumplings, quick too!",0
"Overrated, overpriced, overpacked, over-rude, and over a dirty and busy street!

Seriously, this place is considered one of the best in town?? For what??
Many starts ate there? Cool, they probably haven't be treated as we did, and maybe they received some special dishes form the kitchen.

I love Chinese food and Chinese culture, but the manners is this restaurants should be upgraded to a civilized American restaurant",0
"This place is totally way too hyped and it is not worth the long inefficient wait. 
Their famous soup dumplings have thicker dough than usual soup dumplings and other dishes are just meh.
I know that NYC has so many overrated places because of the tourists who is not very experienced with different cuisines and this place is one of them.
I definitely had better soup dumplings and Chinese dishes at other places. 
You also get to sit with bunch of different strangers and you never get to leave the line for 2 hours because they will just pass you if you are not there. Not to mention, they just automatically charge you a service fee.",0
Not the best meat dumplings in chinatown. A little disappointed with the food. Service is just ok. I don't understand why there are always lots of people waiting for a seat.,0
"Looked good and sounded good but got to tell you, only average.  
Dumplings were good when hot and huge. Order the appetizer and that is your entire meal... But not you have to like pork (the only option is yes pork)
Shrimp and scallop in garlic were excellent.  Truly the BEST item here 
Kung Pao Chicken. Terrible.  Over cooked and boring flavor. Very disappointing 
Cold Sesame Noodles ... Yes these were good and order again
Note.... Very loud restaurant. Do not come for a quite dinner and be prepared to share. Table and waiters climb all over you to set or clear the table. No personal room at all!
Overall. I would be back.  Came once. Been there, done that.  Moving on
Ps. Rice is not included",0
"I actually love the area where this place is nestled in. it kinda has an old school china town back ally sketchy kinda feel to it. its one of those streets that if it was late at night and you saw no one on it.... and the fastest way to get to your house was through this street... you would much rather take the farther route of climbing a steep mountain barefoot with no rope and/or water 

Now to the food. the soup dumplings are quite small and the dumpling is just overly gummy not to mention by the time you get the dumplings... its pretty much dried out and the soup is left to basically droplets. what you say... ""Youre Crazy!!!"".... been here 3 times... not my choice to go but its been the same each time.",0
"One of the more famous soup dumpling places in New York, not a bad choice if you don't have time to venture all the way out to Flushing. The xiaolongbao are slightly larger and has thicker skin than the ones I am used to from Din Tai Fung, but they are very popular. The clientele is mostly non-Chinese and there seems to be a lot of tourists (it is Manhattan after all). The food is average Chinese restaurant fare, not bad but not terrific in my standards. Would I eat it? yes. Would I stand in line for it again? no. If you want to eat at Joe's Shanghai I'd rather go to the midtown location which has more tables and is a bit nicer--the food is comparable.",0
"3.5 stars. Visited for the first time this summer, mainly because of the soup dumplings (xiao long bao). There are 2 varieties to choose from, pork and crab meat. The XLB here are massive. Probably double in size in comparison to any of the others I have tried. The pork XLB were delicious and finished quickly. My group did not enjoy the crab meat XLB however. The crab meat itself was good but the soup inside these dumplings were a seafood broth which was not that enjoyable. The next time I'd definitely get multiple orders of the pork XLB. 

The other dishes we had were standard fare - chicken fried rice, stir fried beef with green peppers, all were tasty and came in large, filling portions. 

Came here on a Saturday for lunch and although there was a line, it took about 15-20 minutes to seat a group of 4. Will return for more XLB!",0
"Have you ever walked into a restaurant already knowing that you're not going to like it? Yeah that was how I felt when I walked into Joe's Shanghai...But, because I'm a sucker for popular/trendy food places and this place is the most reviewed restaurant in Chinatown, I knew I would eventually make my way here. As soon as my group of 3 walked in, we were (not) greeted by an inattentive server and Justin Beiber being blasted on Z100. This is not, by any means, an authentic Shanghainese restaurant and you can tell because the majority of the clientele are not Asian. Because it was a rainy day, we had no problem getting seated but I have heard that there can be a line out the door on better days. Service, for the most part was meh but there was one server who was more attentive.

Scallion pancakes- Flavor was alright but it was too greasy and not crispy enough. For good scallion pancakes try the ones with beef at Nan Xiang in Flushing.
Pork soup dumplings- How is it even possible for people to say that these are the best soup dumplings in NYC?? The skins were so thick, the soup was bland AF, and the pork had impurities in it...
Chicken pan fried noodles- ALL WRONG. I honestly don't even know what they served us but they were definitely not pan fried noodles...The noodles were completely off and the sauce on top tasted like Chinese take out sauce...Skip this one and try the one at Shanghai Cafe instead.

There are a ton of Shanghainese restaurants in Chinatown that are better than this one. This one happens to be the most popular because it caters to a broader population of diners, not because the food is good. Well, I can finally mark Joe's Shanghai as ""attended"" in my books but I will definitely not be back.",0
"First of all dont get spooked with my 3 stars, i still want yall to try this place. The food is good, real authentic as per taste. The szhewan spicy fish is really something you should not miss. It comes with white rice and the fish gravy can be enjoyed with either white rice or fried rice. Both shrimp and spicy fried rice are something worth the money plus the kung pao chicken should not be ignored at all. 
The prices are decent but this is a ""Cash Only"" spot which was a bummer, but they do have ATM in the premises, i guess extra revenue for the business. For me i am a creditCard guy and carry almost No cash at all, and during this COVID situation i don't even prefer cash exchange so this is something i felt somewhat should be considered by the business.
Now the main reason for 3 stars is their awful service. I bet places with free food would treat you better than this place. No smiles or friendly gesture at all. They will bring the food and as soon you done with the food, they will literally wait till you get out. I felt so pressurized to finish the food and GTFO as they were standing right there with new plates and employee ready to clean our table. So i am giving yall heads up if ya dont get a nice friendly customer service but hey the food is what we really appreciated. You can never change the people unless they want to change. Therefore get the cash, be prepared to race the food consumption and grab some candies on your way out, get both you handful so you feel better.",0
"How can I start?
First of all... it is not expensive. Good prices. No Debit cards, or credit cards come with cash.
Be mentally prepared to sit in a round 10 sits table with other people. Food not that good. We went there because we saw the reviews and everyone was doing a big fuzz specially about the soup balls and the food in general. Not good flavors and the place was super unkempt. Restrooms; they will want to make you cry. Not a clean restaurant.",0
"We came all the way from Texas and expecting to get some good soup dumplings and dumplings. The dough was definitely too thick and just a mediocre restaurant serving ""hot & sour"" soup and sweet n sour pork for tourists. Dumplings in Houston, TX taste better than this!",0
"WATER IN DUMPLINGS = BAD

Maybe I'm not a connoisseur of Shanghainese cuisine, but where I come from we like to bite into our dumplings and not have a torrent of putrid pork water come gushing out.   I'm sure this is done on purpose, but I wasn't into it.  

I'll take Cantonese dim sum any day.",0
good food but poor service. Server (Partick) was rude to my friend. My friend asked him for some more rice but he was rude and he said Shit!!,0
"We got here mid afternoon.  There were quite a few people waiting and we were quoted a 15 minute wait time.   We were seated in about 15 minutes so that was great. 

However, it was down hill from there.   While the service was fast it was annoying.   We weren't offered water and when we asked it seemed like it was a big deal to get it.  Ordering was rushed and not pleasant at all.   

Then the food came.   Terrible.   The dumplings were dry and seemed old like they were streamed 3 days ago.   The braised duck was flavorless and also seemed old.   The Singapore noodles were the worst I've ever had.   Dry no seasoning just gross.  I've had better at cheap Vegas buffets. 

I would NEVER come here again and I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.   Prior accolades do not make a great current restaurant.",0
I only come here for the pork soup dumplings. Everyone should definitely start with that as an appetizer or even as your meal.,0
"It's OK. It's not Din Tai Fung, in Arcadia",0
"Not sure what the hype is all about....

If you had Ding Tai Fung then you know what I'm talking about. The skin on the dumplings here are TOO THICK. The meat was average. And the soup inside is not as flavorful as DTF's. This place provides a tong to help you remove the dumplings, but I just end up puncturing the darn thing. Better off using your chopsticks.

We also ordered some noodles (forget the name of the dish). It was like as if it was going through an identity crisis... it's semi stir fry noodles but as the same time it was sitting in soup.... Wouldn't recommend.

Honestly the entire meal was not very memorable. Pretty sure I won't be back.",0
"I know this place is really famous for their soup dumplings but honestly they were a little bit disappointing. Maybe it's cuz they were waay overly hyped but it was just not as good as I thought they would be. The dumpling skin is definitely too thick for my taste.The wait to get in is also horrendous. The only thing that saved the meal was the beef noodle soup. That was so so sooo good! But it was also a little lukewarm. If it was hot, ommgg it would've been perfect! Still craving it now T.T Overall tho, the experience was ehh...",0
"Good soup dumplings. Really tasty. The other items don't seem to be great though. 3 stars for the dumplings only. 

2 stars gone for the following reasons :
1. They don't accept cash
2. They are too cramped and forces you to sit with strangers. That's not an American style nor have I seen it anywhere except this place. What are you trying to do? 

I think the soup dumplings can only go so far. You have to keep up with the 'Quality and Ambience' game too. You can't be pulling the authentic card everytime.",0
"We had a bad experience which is related to the trend of Chinese restaurants in New York Chinatown that only accept cash and adding tips amount in the bill. Although it is kind of noted in the restaurants, sometimes mistakes do happen when double tips were made at check out. The waiters knew yet they would not make a polite reminder to the customers. These practices need to improve before too many bad experiences scare away more and more customers.

Now the food at Joe's, they were just OK.",0
The dumplimg was good but everything else was just okay. It didn't deserve a 5 star especially when you enter the small restaurant the whole place smells like rotton food. That smell does not go away and its not pleasant at all while eating. Also I never like the concept of sharing a table with total strangers.,0
"i only tried the dumplings, which were excellent.  i wouldn't think twice about recommending it to anyone.  it's not a soup.  try to remember that.  it's a dumpling that would normally go in the soup.  at least that's my take on it, but it really was good. i got the crab/pork meat dumpling.  and it was about $7.  about a dollar more than what i'm used to seeing.  but, hey, we all know it's a tourist trap with all those zagat awards.
what sucked was the service.  i went there at about 3p by myself to get my dumplings to go.  at first they gave me an attitude when they thought i was gonna eat in, since i'm not filling the table with more people.  once i told them it's to go, they told me just to wait in the front for my food, where i had the whole waitstaff give me looks like i was in their way every time i passed by.  there was no other place to wait.  the place looked pretty rundown, not unlike most chinese restaurants in the area.
i'd go back again for the dumplings, but i'd order in advance and eat it at home.  i wonder if they deliver?",0
"I don't get the hype for this place. Went at 9:30-10pm and there was a long line, had to wait about 30 mins. The food wasn't good and def not worth waiting for. There's way better Shanghainese food elsewhere....",0
"Pros (soup dumplings, relatively authentic Shanghainese food): Although this place is a well known tourist trap, the fact that Chinese people still go there says a lot about the quality of food they offer. The most popular dish here is the soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) by far, and with good reason. Having had authentic Shanghainese food from both Shanghai and Vic's Godfather, we've decided that the Soup Dumplings here are indeed very good. It's different from the ones in Shanghai of course, but you'll still love these burning buns even if you've had them back in motherland. The other dishes are good as well, and they provide quite a balance of both the traditional and americanized chinese food. For a tourist trap, it's not too bad. 

Cons (everything you can imagine to be negative about a tourist trap restaurant in chinatown new york): The lines are long, the tables crowded, and the service rushed. Sometimes the soup dumplings can be made a little too assembly-line like...

Bottom line: You can do a lot worse than to come to this place, but if you're only here for the Soup Dumplings, there are less crowded places that you can go to that will serve up ones just as good. New Yeah's for example. 

Recommendation: Sit down and immediately order the soup dumplings like a pro.

Comparable to: New Yeah's",0
"Since moving to NY I knew I had to compare this to Din Tai Fung and I have to say, Din Tai Fung is still better.

WAIT: Came on a Saturday at 12:50 pm and there was only a 15-20 minute wait for 4 people.  She gives you a number and then calls it when it is your turn.  If your whole group isn't here, she'll skip over you so make sure everyone in your party is present.

ATMOSPHERE: Did anyone else notice the C health rating for this place? It's definitely your typical hole in the wall crowded, loud, Chinese restaurant with lots of round tables.  So if you come in a small group you may be sitting at a large round table with 2-3 other groups.  It's not that weird since the table is large enough.  The service is fast and pretty efficient so no worries there.

FOOD: Got the green onion pancake and 1 order of the XLBs.

GREEN ONION PANCAKE - pretty good, very flavorful.  Some of the green onions are almost sautéed giving it a grilled onion taste.  The crispy parts are really good but I did have one that was doughy.  They cut it into 8 or so slices.

PORK XLB - 8 in one basket.  Compared to din tai fung, these are much much bigger and they even give you tongs to pick up the pork dumplings. That signifies that the skin is much thicker and doesn't break easily.  As a result of that, the skin isn't as delicate and chewy or fresh tasting as din tai fung.  I will say however, that the soup inside (there's much more soup) is very flavorful and fatty.  So taste wise, I might have to say Joe's is a hair better than din tai fung.  The other thing that Joe's has going for it are the prices, it's about $7 for the entire basket, so cheap!

CASH ONLY so make sure you bring enough.  

Overall, it was definitely good but I still have to say that din tai fung is better.",0
"For some reason, I'd never actually been to Joe's Shanghai before. Fully embracing the tourist experience, I stopped by for a quick lunch. Because I went at a slightly odd hour, I had absolutely no wait, but the restaurant wasn't exactly empty.

The servers really have this down to a science. After being seated, they come around asking ""pork or crab?"" since absolutely everyone orders xlb. I opted for crab, but next time, I'd just order the pork. I also got an order of the turnip cake, but honestly, the xlb is plenty filling.

This is definitely a tourist spot, as I looked around and noticed there were almost no Chinese customers. Ah well. A quick, cheap eat in the city is always a nice find.",0
"Came in for dim sum. I should have looked a bit more before I came. It's not so much dim sum style. But really I just cared about soup dumplings!

We got here at 11:30 on a Sunday and they luckily had just enough spots for us at one communal table in the back. Our table was very friendly and everyone shared their main entrees with each other. We all ordered a bit too much. 

The pork soup dumplings were okay. They were nice and large, cooked well, and the dumpling was the perfect thickness. They suggest you pick it up, take a small bite and suck out the broth; then continue to eat the dumpling. This method actually worked pretty well. I was unfortunate enough to have one soup dumpling get stuck to the lettuce in the steamer and it broke before I could bite it, so beware! I had it in the spoon luckily though, so all was okay.  The broth was not as flavorful as I would have liked and have had before. That was what was missing for me. I really appreciated that they gave us a tweezer tool to pick them up though! Nice touch.

The spring rolls were the star here for me. I don't usually care for them and the flavor was spot on, they were huge, and the rolls crust was perfectly crunch and not too greasy. I was surprised how much I liked them. The sauce they gave us to dip them in was also fantastic. 

The pan fried dumplings were nothing special in my opinion. After I ate one I didn't need to have any more. 

Scallion pancake was good. It was a bit larger than ones I had been served elsewhere. Good flavor and not too greasy. 

Pork fried rice, again nothing special. Was missing some flavor. 

Our neighbor offered me a bite of her Chinese eggplant. This was really nice. Good flavor and I enjoyed the sauce it was cooked in. 

When we left there was a line out the door. Glad we made it in just in time. I'll try somewhere else next time for soup dumplings, and will likely go somewhere where they have more actual dim sum options than just large entrees.",0
"I had my eye on Joe's Shanghai since I moved to NYC.  After spending a month in Shanghai before I came here, I missed xiaolongbao (dumplings with soup on the inside).  Someone had mentioned that this was the place in the city to get xiaolongbao.

Luckily, one of my friends planned brunch here this past Sunday.  We were planning on meeting at 12:30pm... but being me, I managed to get there by 1pm.  They wouldn't seat us until the entire party had arrived so I felt bad making my friends wait.  About 15 minutes later, we were seated at a table for 10 where there was another party on the other side of the table.  It wasn't a bad wait at all (at least for me).

We ordered pork xiaolongbao (dumplings are usually with pork meat so get pork!) and my friend ordered a few cold dishes (noodles, drunken chicken, cold beef) and some others (dumplings, scallion pancake, fried buns).  The meal was filling, we could have done without the last couple of dishes we ordered, and it was only $13!  Also, dishes came out surprisingly quickly.  

BUT--I will say that the xiaolongbao were okay.  The top of the dumplings were a bit stiff, but I guess this is the best you can get outside of Shanghai.  For a place that should be all about xiaolongbao (and other Shanghainese dishes), they did about a 3 star job.

Some tips: cash only and a 15% already included, go early to avoid the wait (by the time we left, there were about 4-5 tables of people waiting to get seated)",0

"Not sure why people rave about this place. In short, save your time and money. We are big fans of XLB and Chinese food in general. The XLB ""soup dumplings"" in this place are absolutely gross. They filling is not tasty, especially the crab (they totally use canned or preserved products). They are greasy and not tasty at all. I saw a few postings saying they have better XLB than Din Tai Fung...Seriously people? Not comparable in anyway. 

Anyway, if you are looking for disgustingly tasting food and TERRIBLE service, be my guest.",0
Went downhill sometime around 2000 but the guidebooks never updated their reviews so it's possibly the most popular mediocre establishment in Manhattan.,0
"I used to come here with my family for soup dumplings but I don't go anymore due to the long wait from tourists. The service is your traditional fast pace Asian restaurant, where you might find yourself sharing a large round table with strangers. Some might mistake the waiters brusque manners for rudeness but they're just being efficient. Food is still good although Americanized  (ie. A bit saltier and more sauce). As a local, this wouldn't be my first choice to come or bring visitors. I'll probably go to Shanghai cafe if I need to get my soup dumpling fix.",0
"haha! the wait here is ridic!!!!!!!! This place is more for tourist and white people. It can be an hour wait at times. But their soup dumplings is the best. What I don't like is, that sometimes they try to force to leave as quickly as possible so they can sit another party down. I remember having to share a table with other strangers. I did not like that.",0
"The food is mediocre. SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. When I arrived, there were about 30 people waiting outside so I thought I'd be in for a treat if that many people were willing to wait. After being finally seated an hour later, I was eager to taste their famous soup dumplings, given all the great reviews. The soup dumplings were good, but I've had better and I was expecting amazing. As for their wonton soup... My homemade version beats theirs by miles. Decent prices and ok food but definitely not worth the hype. I guess they have a big ego because they treat customers like numbers rather than people. People arriving after me, were seated before me. Even those people apologized to me. I will definitely not be returning. Despite poor service I might have returned if the food lived up to the hype of the plethora of newspaper clippings on their front windows. Obviously, it didn't.",0
"Good soup dumplings. To be honest, not sure I think it's worth the wait because you can get other good soup dumplings elsewhere for no wait.",0
Busy restaurant we couldn't eat something. Menu was bad for strangers. It's not explanatory.,0
"This place is always packed! People come here for the soup dumplings which are pretty good. I usually get 2 orders of soup dumplings, one order would be pork and the other is crabmeat. I'd recommend their fried rice, fried noodles, and if ure really hungry and not afraid of gettin stuffed--try their rice cakes! When theyre super busy w a long wait outside, i actually go next door to Joes Ginger becos theyre the same restaurant, have the same exact menu. Heard the owner owns both.. So jus incase u didnt kno now u do ;)",0
"Two stars for the scallion pancakes and soup dumplings.

The service was horrible! The waiter literally yelled at my bf for asking a clarifying question. He also NEVER came back after placing our order. We had to track down random servers and even being acknowledged was a hassle. The other waiters were in a group showing each other their cellphone and laughing.

I'm never coming here again. I'll go down the street to Shanghai Manor for better service at a cheaper price !",0
"Came here and we ordered a number of items but I only ate two dishes. Very busy but I find the food wasn't as good as the hype.  The dumplings were good but nothing extraordinary. The beef noodle soup was a major disappointment with tough beef that's chewy and the noodles were just inedible.   Overall, the food is just ok. Nothing to hype about.",0
Underwhelmed by this place.  There is much better Chinese available without the wait time and the take it or leave it staff.  This is a tourist trap.,0
"Used to be great soup dumplings and I've been coming here for years.  Not so much now.  Lard pours out of the dumpling when opened and they just aren't as good any more.
On my last visit yesterday they're charging a ""15% service fee"" that's put in there before taxes.  I declined paying that on my LAST VISIT.",0
"Wow, this place has a lot of reviews.  So anyway, I went here with a group of 14 from work for a farewell lunch for our interns.  We ordered food to eat family style and I will definitely say it is inexpensive.  I thought the dumplings (pork, since I don't love crab) were delicious.  The scallion pancakes were just okay.  The sesame chicken hit the spot.  I don't eat squid but my co-workers insisted on ordering that dish because they love it so much.  The eggplant was forgettable.  The mushroom dish was decent but a little too heavy on the soy for my taste.  So maybe I didn't absolutely love this place because of the dishes we ordered and I might like it more if I went with friends and just ordered what sounds good to me.  I probably won't go back though.",0
"wait time was ridiculous and you still had to share a table with strangers. Price was good, cheaper than most places for the xiao long dumplings but the dumpling itself was just ok. Only had to options. Service staff was hard to get a hold of and wasn't so good.
I had to try this place since I had heard so much about the rave...more hype then it should be",0
I've been waiting for my food for 35 minutes. Terrible service.  They need to hire more people. I so mad I'm waisted my entire lunch break here.   I don't recommend this place,0
"This place was a major disappointment for me. I had high hopes for their XLB because everyone raved about it. Located in the back of the alley in Chinatown. This place only takes cash, came here on a Monday noon and there was no wait at all. Ordered their crab meat xlb, pork xlb, and shredded pork soup noodle. All of the items didn't impress me at all. Wouldn't return, don't know what the hype is about. In my opinion din tai dung xlb is wayyyyyyyyyy better LOL. P.s 15% gratuity is already included in your bill no matter what's the party size. Also service was okay but not great. Don't expect anything because it's in Chinatown.",0
"I've had better -- go to Shanghai Cafe -- for cheaper. 

Don't get what all the noise is about. :/",0
"A bit too much hype, and perhaps I got my hopes up way too high.

Came in at about 1:30pm to an absolutely full house. Since it was just me, I was seated, family style, with two other groups. I ordered the pork soup dumplings and it arrived in a huge bamboo steamer. There really wasn't a lot meat inside of each dumpling, it was mostly soup. And the soup lacked the pizzaz in its flavor. Staff seemed really unhappy, I didn't feel as if I was served well. I wasn't ever offered a drink while I was there. More like cattle calling everyone in and out as fast as they could.",0
"I live in San Francisco and the soup dumplings out there are far better. Our table couldn't even finish the pork soup dumplings. We did enjoy the Shanghai noodles, though.",0
"Was a little disappointed when I went. I had heard a lot about this place and their famous soup dumplings. Honestly, they're just okay and I didn't understand the hype once I took my first bite. My boyfriend looked at me after his first bite and said, ""Are you sure these are the ones everyone talks about?"" Definitely don't make a trip to NYC just for these. I'm glad we ordered other dishes in addition to the dumpling disappointment or else this place would probably just get 2 stars. Their pan fried noodles were delicious!",0
Waited over an hour on a Tuesday around noon.  Wait staff was fast and efficient.  XLB were exceptional but the other dishes like rice cakes and eggplant were just average.,0
"lthe food was overly salty and full of msg. it was also extremely oily. Tourist spot in chinatown, there are no asian people goign to the restaurant, that explains a lot! horrible service as well.

Do not go!",0
"Joe's is loud, overcrowded with tourists, and the food is subpar in my opinion. There are far better places like New Green Bo to get ""famous"" soup dumplings. Joe's = yawn + eye roll.",0
"Um... I like shanghai cafe better. Yes overall it was a little more expensive. I know joe's is more famous and it's really cool to see all the celebrity pics on the wall with joe but I thought the food quality was a little lower here too. Let me explain: the soup dumplings were very very fragile compared to shangcaf. The other dishes had barely any meats in it just all veggies... is that cheap or what. 
They also sat us with other groups of random people. I know space is a limited thing but c'mon man!",0
"If you want bad customer service, come to this place!

My brother and I went to Joe's Shanghai for pork and crab meat dumpling.  After we had pork dumpling, the server tried to take away our plates and force us to leave.  We sat down for less than 15 minutes and the server already gave us a bill. 


People have the same tables with us, ordered the same dumpling after we ordered, but they got the dumpling first..


No matter how popular this place is and how good the dumplings are , I will not come to this place again!!!",0
"Even the dumplings can't make up for the incompetent hostess's at the door, the extremely long wait times (50 minutes after being told 20 minutes multiple times), the cramped, loud quarters and the rushed service.  Don't waste your time!",0
"Tourist Trap!!! 

I used to come here 10 years ago but some much has changed since last night. I understand that if a place is good, I can wait.

It was a Wednesday night and the place was packed. I don't even want to rate about their service because I expected none. 

However, the food is garbage and is way over priced. I can see the German tourists who sat in front of us were disappointed with the food since they had so much left over. 

First, we ordered their most famous crab meat soup dumplings. It has no crab meats and the old nice and juicy flavor is not there anymore. The skin is really hard. The order came out really quick. They had it done long before. They just kept the dumplings heated. I understand that they want more businesses so they make it in bulk but you can't downgrade the quality of food for the sake of speeding the process. Good dumplings take times to steam. 

The signature Shanghai sautéed noodles was drenched in oil and lots of salts and they are very cheap on the meats that a regular Chinese take out noodles tasted better than that crap. 

I couldn't understand why the American people who sat next to us kept saying that they are having the best dumplings. I really wanted to tell them that they are not eating good dumplings. Everyone has their own taste and they made it suitable for non Asian taste. 

It just bothers me that they are having such high ratings for that quality of food that they didn't put effort on it. I won't comment about the price but all I have to say that your money are more well spent on your local Chinese take out place than here, because they are serving you the same quality of food.",0
"I'm sorry New York, I love your city but I tried the soup dumplings at Joe's in October and they can't touch those at House of Mandarin Noodle in Temple City CA. I know this isn't going to go down well but as consolation let me say that, contrary to other comments here,  the wait at Joe's wasn't bad at all.",0
"Alright so let's see.

We arrive here 10 pm on a saturday night. As soon as we get seated, a server walks over and grunts,""Last order, crab or pork?"" 

My friend and I look at each other, a little confused. We look back at him and ask, ""Can we have a few minutes?"" He rolls his eyes and spews, ""We are about to close,"" before walking away. I can understand if a restaurant has their own last order policy at a specific time, but literally 30-45 mins after we order, another party is seated and that same server fiends over asking the same thing, ""Last order, we're almost closed. Crab or pork?"" Like that doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and that guy seems too angry to be serving people food.

Oh and the dumplings are mediocre at best. Admittedly, the scallion pancake was really good. The crab meat (with pork) dumplings and pork dumplings pretty much tasted the same (both had mostly pork, why even make two separate items? Oh I know, so you can put a little imitation crabmeat in one of them and charge an extra $2). Second time I've been here in 2 years and still consistently fraudulent. Hope that bum of a server learns how to live life happy.",0
"Joe's Shanghai was very adequate. I'm giving it three stars because I didn't have incredibly high expectations, but I asked my friend what she thought and she said two because of it's reputation as some of the best dim sum in the city. 

HOWEVER, as long as your expectations aren't as inflated as Joe's Shanghai's reputation, it's really not bad.

The pros: 
1) The system for getting seated was actually better than I expected. They give you a ticket with a number on it (like the deli counter at the grocer) and you're seated in order that way. It's a good way of ensuring that you won't be forgotten if you come at a time when there's a long wait. Also, we came at 7:30 on a Friday and only waited 15 minutes. Maybe we were just lucky, but I was surprised it was such a short wait. 

2) Service was fast - if we hadn't taken some time to sit and chat after our meal, we could have been out of there in like 30 minutes.

3) CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP - total bill per person after more than enough food + a beer for each one of us was $20. They add on a service charge but it's only 15% - I only tip lower than that normally if something horrendous happens, so tip was actually cheaper than what I probably would have paid otherwise.

The cons:
1) The food was just mediocre. We ordered 2 orders of soup dumplings (note: for whatever reason on their menu the dumplings are listed as 'pork buns'. We tried to order both, thinking the dumplings were off-menu, and were told they were the same thing), the fried pork dumplings, the scallion pancake, shrimp lo mein, and mai fun - for four of us, it ended up being way more than enough food. The soup dumplings were some of the best I've had, but my boyfriend said that he's had better near his office in midtown. The fried dumplings were okay, although I thought they were too greasy/heavy. I didn't personally try the scallion pancake or the lo mein. The mai fun was okay, although the shrimp in it was pretty gnarly. I hate when places don't de-vein their shrimp.

2) I did NOT like the communal seating. Other reviewers had mentioned it and I assumed it was like a long table sort of thing - rather, we had a round table for 8 people and our party of 4 was sat with a family of 4. It was so so weird, and rather uncomfortable. Felt like an elementary school lunch table. 

Oranges were brought out with the check, which was nice. 

TL;DR: Maybe would come back if in the area, wouldn't go out of my way again. CASH ONLY.",0
"Not sure about the reviews or the line to get in. The soup dumplings lacked flavor as did the Shanghai noodles. Perhaps the food is bland for the tourist clientele. The ""sichuan"" oil on the table tasted like it was made from regular red pepper. Better Shanghai style on Mott street. Cash only and the tip is added to every check.",0
"The reason for 2 stars has nothing to do w/ the food-- in fact, the food was fabulous. Soup dumplings (xiao long bao) were amazing and definitely hit the spot the night I was there when it was 1000 degrees below freezing. However, thanks to the bitchy hostess who screamed at us for not being accurate about how many we had in our party, this place gets a meager 1-star rating from Clee. We could have easily squeezed in that extra chair, but nope-- apparently, saying you have 1 less person in your party than you actually do is a heinous crime.",0
"i used to come here all the time w/ a friend before i found Shanghai Cafe. its ok tho i prefer my soup dumplings to be a little thicker so they dont break so easily and spill on my shirt, yes its happened here before. i forgot what else i've eaten here but it was nothing special since i dont remember it. also sharing a table here sucks",0
"I am Chinese and brought a few American friends to China Town and hoped to have some REAL genuine Chinese food.  I was totally disappointed because it is so westernized (like every dish has same heavy oily sauces), the menu is full of these typical fake Chinese dishes which do not exist in China but hugely popular here like Zuo Zong Tang Chicken and sesame chicken.   Almost all the guests are American and I was the only Chinese sitting there.   I will never go again.  There is soooo many good Chinese food in China Town like ""Congee village"" 粥之家 and ""August Gathering"" 富瑶 and many more ...",0
"I by far have the craziest story about this place! First of all Ter, Esther and I decide to check out this ridiculously famous soup dumpling place. Apparently, Chinese people came up with this brilliant idea of making a dumpling soup all- in- one dumpling. The soup is actually inside the dumpling. Good way to cut out the middle man, China!

After much debacle of being lost in the financial district of NY, numerous map checking, gaggles of do- you- know- where- we- are- going, and lots of iphone google mapping we trudge our way into Chinatown. We finally make it to Pell Street! We walk up the steps only to have the hostess give us a ticket and estimated time of eating. And it's only 5pm... I thought New Yorkers ate dinner late at night! Eh.

Joe's Shanghai does something that I rarely see in California. They seat people Benihana style. As in, they have like 15 large round tables that seat 9 people each. If you party can't fit at a square table (like a table for 4), your party sits at a large round table. And if you have a few extra seats available because your party is small, you get to sit with a whole bunch of strangers that are next in line for seats.

* Names have been changed. And if you are any of the people that I mentioned in this review. Please feel free to send me a message. It would be crazy if we touch base via yelp. Because really, I don't have tourettes.

We finally get our number called and we get escorted to a table... It looks like a table of models? I see a lot of beer bottles. Oh no, they aren't models, they love their bottles, but they are ivy league UPenn banker- type yuppies? Eh? Sitting at the table is what appears to be the Friends cast. Three gorgeous girls with three gorgeous guys. It was like a J Crew catalog. Or a high road A&F shoot. Ridiculous. And I thought only Californians looked that good.

Ne hooz, during the meal Ross and Rachel (the couple that used to date and now they are just friends) start teasing each other. Not like you are funny... funny looking. har har. 

But more like...

Rachel: ""Ross, remember that time when I was doing you with the strap on?""

Ross: ""Oh, yeah baby. You rocked my world.""

The kind where the 3 Asian girls would look at each other, cover their mouths and reveal a shy should- I- even- be laughing?- giggle... Inner battle between the two cultures... The submissive Asian side, where I think... I think it might be improper to laugh out loud, but since I am so accomodating I will release a shy giggle. And the Westernized side where I am like, ""Damn that bitch was funny"". Fall off my chair and roll on the floor laughing.

So, what do I do... I giggle like a lil school girl in pigtails. =X

After Joey picks up the tab he says, ""Wow, I take three girls out and the bill is only 19 dollars. I have never picked up such a dinky tab. Damn, you girls are cheap.""

And I say, ""Don't forget the lube"". 

Joey, ""Wow, you said don't forget the lube. That is awesome!""

(distant clinking of beer and sake bottles and people doing the wave around the round table). 

And then the lil 25 year old Asian girl sporting her Abercrombie sweater is shamed. TOO BAD I said it in reference to Rachel using a strap on... on him. 

Note to self. Don't ever say ""Don't forget the lube"" in the middle of dinner.

But yes, the dumplings are good. And yes, you have to take a small bite from the top, let the soup leak on to your spoon and place cautiously in mouth. The dumplings are hot! Saying lube during dinner is not.",0
"Given the hype around this place and their soup dumplings I was a bit let down. Came on a Thursday later afternoon for an early dinner and there was plenty of seating available. Me and a couple friends split the Crab Meat with Pork Meat Dumplings (A1) and Pork Meat Soup Dumplings (A2). I thought the soup wasn't all that great and the meat was just fine. Nothing necessarily bad about this place, just think it's rather overhyped.",0
"Note: review based mostly on their bread and butter as the rest of the menu is mediocre at best.

First off I don't understand why people call it ""soup dumpling"" when it's suppose to be ""Xiao Long Bao"". Soup dumpling is a completely different dish we Shanghainese call ""Tang Bao"" - Tang = Soup, Bao = Dumpling (roughly). 

So right off the bat, if you hear people calling Xiao Long Bao's as ""soup dumplings"" then you already know they have no idea what they are talking about and they are just another product of mass consumption. =)

Anyways...

I've eaten here on several occasions and each time I try to justify why people line up for this....ahhhh, they have never tried the real Xiao Long baos to have an appropriate comparison.

Cons: 1. soup inside is too oily, too salty, too thick, too rich (it's almost like the top layer you sift away when making beef stew) 2. The texture of the skin is rough, not as smooth and delicate as it is suppose to be 3. the size is not what a Xiao Long Bao is suppose to be

Pros: I like their cold dishes (yep, no pros for the Xiao Long Baos)

Overall the majority of the dished ont he menu are throwaways but I'll eat the ""soup dumplings"" on occasion when I can't fly back to Shanghai or when I can't visit a Ding Tai Fung (even DTF is mediocre at best). 

I think the high ratings for this restaurant is almost as if I were to go to Peter Lugars and give them 5 stars because I absolutely don't know any better and think eating steak with no sauce is the best idea since sliced bread.",0
In the winter when there was no wait the soup dumplings are good. That is if you are craving soup dumplings only. We were told that we had a 30 minute wait. We ended up waiting for 1 hour 15 min -it was sweltering hot and the lady kept calling numbers before and after us of parties of various sizes. Finally we had to squish in a corner with strangers and ordered the soup dumplings- crab- which were really good. Not worth the wait. The number calling was totally unfair.,0
"The food there is alright, famous in Chinatown for its ""Shanghai Crackmeat Dumpling"", but I've tasted better somewhere else before.  Most importantly, the service is pretty bad there.  The place relatively small, so whenever there's a line the door, the Chinese waiter or waitress there will try everything to get you finish up your meal, pay the bill and leave, so they can server the next table.   I figured that's probably why they automatically include 15% service charges of your bill (that's 15% of your bill+tax they charging automatically to your bill),  otherwise they would never going to get good tips with that kind of service they're providing. Despite the foold is not so bad, I will not go there again just because of bad services.",0
"We Waited for 1 hour to get a seat, but what we ended up with having is a table shared with another two customers. It is a bit awkward and unpleasant after the long wait.  We ordered the fish on top of the recommendation list, but the fish is not fresh at all.  I don't really recommend this restaurant, and the only reason it is popular could be that nonChinese people like it, but it is not really good Chinese food.",0
"I went to this restaurant after several recommendations about their soup dumplings, which even celebrities have raved about. Upon arrival, there was a line to get seated. After seats opened up, it was likely that you would be sitting at a huge table with strangers. 

Since it was so busy, you could tell that the waters were rushed. It took them a long time to get us water, and even longer for them to take our order. After the orders came out, they failed to answer any of our questions, or clarify which dish was for who. 

Even though the soup dumplings were good, I wouldn't say that they were worth the travel and wait. Honestly, there are several restaurants within the same vicinity that serve soup dumplings as well.",0
"First time we've been back to Joe's since the pandemic, and the first time since they moved from Pell to Bowery in 2019. What a massive disappointment! After maybe 20 years of regularly heading to Joe's with friends and out of town guests we definitely won't be going back. I will bullet point this horror story to make it clearer:

1) Got seated and watched several waiters standing around doing nothing. They were literally standing still and staring off into space or at walls while we and other tables needed help. After five minutes I managed to get someone's attention to ask who our waiter was and that person offered to take our order, as if it was our responsibility to track someone down.

2) Unfortunately, our waiter barely spoke English and I couldn't understand what he was saying at several key points. One of the dishes we ordered was Joe's iconic soup dumplings and somehow he thought we wanted three orders for three people (which is waaay too much; there are 8 dumplings in each order). When three orders were delivered to our table and I explained  we only wanted one, the waiter became disgusted and acted like it was our fault. I watched as he brusquely snatched back two orders and stomped toward the kitchen where he gathered with other staff and gestured toward our table as if we were trouble. 

3) Speaking of soup dumplings, there is a lot of liquid involved in eating them, but they gave us small plates instead of bowls, which meant there was no way to lap up the juices with the spoon. We ended up tipping the plate into our spoons in order to taste the broth, which of course made a mess. What the heck is going on with that? They are called ""SOUP dumplings,"" so bring some SOUP bowls! Also, the dumplings used to be so hot you could barely handle them and you had to be careful when eating them, and now they're only lukewarm.

4) Whenever we needed something (napkins, more water, tea) we had to look around for our waiter and it was virtually impossible to get his attention. So we started grabbing other staff whenever we could, but getting anyone's attention was challenging. The service is absolutely AWFUL!!! Service at the old Joe's on Pell was always a bit curt but very efficient. That is gone!

5) They don't bring black tea unless you ask. Most Chinese restaurants either bring tea automatically or at least ask whether you want tea. When they did bring the tea it was in plastic cups. Eww! Tea and plastic don't go together. Gross!

6) Most Chinese restaurants bring white rice with the meal or at least ask if you want white rice. Not at Joe's (anymore).

7) The food at Joe's used to be so good we would regularly pass 25 decent restaurants and schlep down to Chinatown. However, the food has officially turned to average. Not bad by any means, but no longer the feeling that we were eating food we couldn't get a block from our Midtown apartment. Why schelp all the way down there when we can walk half a block and get as good or better? Ollies is better than Joe's and we don't have to wait 45 minutes to get a table because they take reservations.

So we're officially done with Shanghai Joe's. It was delish while it lasted but Joe's has run its course now and the staff just don't care. We feel a little sad saying goodbye but all good things must come to an end.",0
"the steam dumpling taste horrible ! I don't understand where all these good reviews come from. The skin of dumplings is thick, the meat is not good quality and salty . I came from Shanghai and know how the good stuff taste! This one is really horrible. The noddle is too wet and salty.",0
We coming for dinner she tell us wait for 20 minuets and we waiting for over hour and 15 mins and the lady with the ponytail have a bad attitude and never smile. So sad.,0
"we definitely visit joes shanghai every time we are in nyc. but this was our first time visiting the new location since they moved. we remember we thought the place was good everytime we visited in the old location. but when we visited it at the new location, the quality of the food definitely went down and kind of limited. the noodles were very starchy. the pork soup dumplings were not hot. we were actually disappointed with the quality of the food.",0
"This place was pretty underwhelming considering how much hype there is when you look at the yelp reviews. Far from being the best XLB. Dumplings are a little bit over sizes, the flour skin is also too thick. Definitely worth a try. It's cheap and I would definitely go back but it's nothing to rave about.",0
"The famous Joe's Shanghai. Great xiao long baos (soup dumplings). Loved that they're served with the huge pieces of cabbages in the bamboo baskets to help retain even more moisture and flavor. The flavors are exquisite and you really should each order at least one serving for yourself because eff sharing.

Unfortunately, that's the only thing good about this place so I have mixed emotions and a review for this place. On the one hand, the XLBs are great and you got to try them if you can. On the other, the wait is always at least for 30 minutes and seriously, everything else on the menu is lacking in flavor and attention. So I will include this in both my must try and over hyped lists for NYC.",0
"We tried their soup dumplings, crab and pork. We actually tried a few restaurants for Xiao long bao and I would give this place 2 stars. Just on their dumplings!!! The sauce they use for the dumpling is too salty, it ruined the dumplings for me. The sauce is just as important as the dumplings itself. But the dumplings wasn't good at all. We didn't even finish the dumplings, and I hate to waste food.",0
"We waited two hours and the food was just ok.

I can't write too much about it, except I was mildly unamused. I don't know what the hype is. The xlb is huge and good, but is it worth the wait?! Not in my opinion. Everything else was good too, but nothing to write home about.

So crowded and we sat with another couple. We took so long to eat, we ate with another couple.

Not bad if you can get seated ASAP.",0
"The dumplings were the main reason I was brought here. The experience wasn't all that good with the crab overpowering the soup. I was assured not every joes shanghai place isn't like this. Yet the price is increased compared to other ones. That's why two stars deducted. Otherwise wait nope there is more. Too much oil on the noodles. Chopsticks couldn't catch a grip....
Not a good first time experience.",0
"The first time I tried Joe's Shanghai; I was in love.  Second time; the love is gone.  Maybe the cook was having a bad day?  The xia long bao skin was a bit hard and chewy.  The meat and soup juices was still consistantly yummy.  It just didn't have that ""wow"" factor anymore.  The cabbage leaves in the bamboo steam tray they put the dumplings on looked old with black spots on it.  Almost as if they reused them again.  Boo!

I've been told this is just another tourist trap in a NYC chinatown alley.  It does get rather crowded.  I'm sure there are better Shanghai soup dumplings places elsewhere in NYC.",0
Got soup dumplings. It was good but a bit salty. The salt and pepper short ribs are overwhelmingly salty. I can see the msg on it.,0
"Pork soup dumplings were very good: much larger than expected, thicker dumpling skin, and lots of savory soup. The green beans were mediocre. Overall, if you've ever been to Din Tai Fung, you'll agree that this is no competition. 
They don't take reservations, and the process of getting seated is very hectic. Some people were given tickets, while I was not and had to ask. Service here is average at best: waiters are not attentive and as such, it is difficult to flag anyone down. I had to wait very long before ordering and asking for the check. An 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill--interesting, considering the level of service. Also, they only accept cash!",0
"Because of all the hype, I thought this place would be as good as everyone else said it would be. But..the food is average. Nothing special about them. Tried 3 different types of dumplings (pork, chicken, seafood). They all tasted the same. Their noodles were good but nothing to really rave about.",0
"This place is overrated to me. They're famous for their soup dumplings, but honestly, their soup dumplings is only alright to me. Nothing that really blows me out of the water compared to other ones that I've had. The price pretty good though. They're cash only and gratuity is included in the check. The service is really bad though but that's typical for the OG Asian restaurants.",0
"Service: 2/ 5 star 
Food: 4/5 stars 

Getting there on a Saturday night,  I expect it to be busy.  Was told it's a 30 minute wait for 3 people,  ok that's fine and they gave me my ticket number.  While waiting,  the guy with a mic kept yelling out ticket numbers ( that was going by quantity of people,  not ticket number order) we kept hearing him say all the 2 tops but none of the other 3 or more tables. There was a lot of people waiting for their number and delivery app drivers were getting angry as well. 
  The guy was having a meltdown on the amount of people waiting . 30 minutes went to over an hour wait. I'm sorry but don't give me a time frame where it isn't true, where the are other errands to finish. 
Some friends were in the japanese restaurant next door and finished within the waiting time of our restaurant. 
Some other people in line went to the japanese restaurant and were finishing their drinks, to wait out their time for joes shanghai ticket number to be called.
 The food was good and brought out at adequate timing,  since we had over an hour to look at the menu and ordered within sitting down.  Tried to order hot water multiple times,  I finally got it with the third server.  Is hot water that much of a rarity?? 
Pan fry noodles,  pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, fried fish,  all meats dish, and jellyfish were all tasty. 2 dishes came with jalapeños and those definitely packed some heat, even without the jalapeños on the dish . The bill came and automatically charged us 18% tip. That was laughable. The service wasn't that great. Their untrustworthy wait time, mainly their organization in the restaurant watered down their tip a lot, and tries to get hot water did not deserve an automatic 18%.",0
"3 1/2 stars. 
There is a reason why there is always a string of lines waiting outside of the restaurant, despite the speedy service. Yes, it is a tourist trap. Yes, everything else besides the ""xiao long bao,"" aka soup dumplings are worthless, but that's just it. When you come here, the only thing that is amazing on this menu are those crabmeat soup dumplngs, disregard everything else, and you will have one heck of a good time. 
Unlike Nanxiang, the king of soup dumplings, Joe's Shanghai does not make them on the spot, ours came out within three minutes, and were slightly undercooked. They were nevertheless amazing, full of juices and bits of crabs. Mhmm yummy!",0
This place was ok. The soup dumplings were good but just your average soup dumpling . (All Soup Dumplings are good) The Kung pao chicken was a bit of a let down because it didn't have much flavor. A little bit of a letdown because it wasn't that great despite the rave reviews.,0
"All hype. Not good. Gross soup dumplings (unusually big), basic sautéed string beans, poor tasteless scallion pancakes, not great hot & sour soup. Only decent thing was their crispy shredded beef. Did I come on a bad day? Not sure why so many people rated it so high.",0
"I really should be more understanding, but while the food here was good, I don't know if it was worth the hike in my blood pressure for the experience.  The energy that this place gives off is SO RUSHED.  

The way they rush you to your seat when a table opens.  
The way that you are sitting at a communal round table with 6 other parties of 2.
The way the wait staff is rushedly leaning inbetween you every 10 seconds to give something to that couple sitting at your table.
The way they rush you to order, and make you feel like you should know immediatley what you want, or what is good there.
The way they rush you to leave once the other parties at your table start finishing up.

Granted, I found this place on Yelp, so I realized it was going to be crowded.  The food was fantastic.  We ordered the pork dumplings (apparently not the SOUP dumplings though, as we got confused when ordering and the waiter seemed to just rush us) which were good, and the kung pao chicken and beef and broccoli.  All of the food that came out was delicious.   And I'll give credit where credit is due - these guys work their asses off!!

My drawback, like I said, is it is definitely not a relaxing meal.  However, I probably will go back to try these famed SOUP dumplings.",0
"Rude tourist trap. Dont get your own table. You have to share it. Treated like cattle. Food fair at best. Reminded me of frozen chinese food So many better places around, trick you too with an extra service charge. Nasty staff too. Go to Wo Hop or others around. This is bad. Yelp steered me wrong. Must be tourists leaving reviews.          Only a B ratng...",0
"We decided to go here because someone said it was better than Din Tai Fung. TOTALLY NOT TRUE. The waitress was very rude. We came in and asked how long the wait was and the waitress said it would be able 5 min. While we were waiting, we overheard her complaining (in Chinese) that a customer was staying too long and that they should hurry up and leave. When my mom asked 5 min later if we could get a seat (since there were some empty ones), she rudely replied, ""I told you to wait 5 min. Please be patient."" Normally, I would've already left at this point, but we stayed for the food.

Finally seated (we were grouped with random people at a table), we ordered the xiao long bao and a few other dishes. It was definitely very mediocre food. Maybe New York don't have authentic good Chinese food or something, but I have no idea why this place is rated so high. Our group of 4 people were all from the SF Bay Area in CA and agreed that we would never come here again.

Also, this place was not very clean. Our plates had dried food crusted on.",0
"Soup Dumplings are great but their service leaves a lot to be desired. Been a fan for about 5 years however I was very disappointed on my last trip when I saw their C grading. For a place that stays constantly busy and makes money they should really have their health inspection as one of their priorities. Having worked in a restaurant I know that there can be a range of things that can get you from an A to a B, such as leaving an ice scoop in the ice maker or leaving boxes of products on the floor instead of on a shelf. However it looks like their offenses were much greater than that such as roaches and vermin prone environments. There are certain things I can look past however for now Joe's won't be getting my business until they think about practicing safe food handling as much as getting my money. A quick Google search will give you the information you need, Joe's Shanghai health inspection grade C report results.",0
"A tourist or tik tok place at best !! If you're from NYC no reason to go at all food was ok .. great scallion pancakes.. soup dumplings fair at best .. TONs of places that are way better.. Dim Sum Palace much better .. service ok nothing special. bathroom dirty , where you dry yr hands tons of dust and grime.. walking up the steps from Bathroom not a good sight on the steps .. idk what the hype is .. will not ever return",0
"Notice there's a lot of ""Joe's"" who own restaurants around NYC! There's Shanghai Joe, Joe's Ginger, Joe's Restaurant and even another Joe's Shanghai in midtown! And guess what? They all happen to be Chinese restaurants too! Oh, people are just oh-so-creative these days :)

I've been here countless times already and I used to be so thrilled about this place! However, lately I've been finding myself more and more disappointed with their xiao long baos. (FYI- my favorite place for soup dumplings is Din Tai Fung in Taipei-- the BEST XLBs in the world!!) Unfortunately, the last time I went to Joe's, I found their XLBs to be only so-so, with the meat inside the dumplings to be slightly pink and very very oily. Maybe there's a new chef in the kitchen? Or my trip back to Taiwan awakened my tastebuds..I have no idea. Their other chinese dishes are good but also americanized for the local taste.

Joe's Shanghai is ALWAYS busy on the weekends (being slightly better on the weekdays). I guess that's what you get for being one of the most popular restaurants in Chinatown! I must say though, the price is pretty good for what you get -- big portions! This place is cash only and the waiters are for the most part, helpful and friendly.",0
"3.5 stars

Bf and I have tried many different dumpling spots and were excited to try Joe's as we've heard many great things. The restaurant is located in an alley of CT. The tables are communal, meaning you will share a table with strangers whether you like it or not (if your party is big enough, I suppose you may not have to deal with this). Inside is a little run-down and dingy, but expected (still seemed OK to me).

We tried the crab and pork XLB, pork XLB, potstickers, and the fried rice. Love the size, juiciness and soupiness of the XLB. However I was not too drawn to the taste of the dumplings. I probably liked the pork more than the crab + pork combo, but I still think I have had tastier ones. Skin was not too thin or thick imo. I was able to use my chopsticks to pick up the dumplings with ease, no leaking. I appreciate the sizable portions--the dumplings are probably twice the size of standard XLB. I was extremely full by the end of the meal. I don't remember anything too special about the potstickers, but I really liked the fried rice. The fried rice was well-seasoned and the rice was nice and firm with a ton of egg.

Overall a pretty OK experience. There are a ton of people dining in, so expect a wait. But still a good place to try at least once if you're visiting.",0
It's too touristy for me. I don't understand why every book is so in love with this place. The soup dumplings are not that great compared to some more authentic places in chinatown. I guess it's worth a visit for the hype but I wouldn't go back. The lines are always impossibly long? Why?,0
There's insect in the food!!!!!! And terrible handling services. Food taste great but just dirty as hell,0
"Had my very first xiao loan bao at Joes in FLUSHING Queens over 20 yrs ago and the rest was history.  Nothing can come close to their taste and quality.  Have had them in many other places in china as well but nothing came close to the one in Flushing.  So when Joes went out of business in flushing during the pandemic i had to settle for other xiao loan bao places.  The only Joes left was the new shop in manhattan's ctown.  The cost of an order have since went up during the pandemic from 7.95 to 14 bucks an order.  Ok, fine since its the best, right?.  NO.  The old one from flushing was without a doubt 10/10.   Ctown was a 6 the most.  Don't taste the same.  Sigh.",0
"My friend hyped this place up so much that I hauled a bunch of friends here through rain, traffic & a 20 minute wait.  Too much hype, too touristy and pretty average.  I would pop in this place if it was in my hood, less crowded or cheaper.  Otherwise this is not a destination resto.  Big ole Meh...",0
"Let me just tell you 40 minutes, does not mean 40 minutes

My family party of 3 sat and waited for an hour and a half. A family of 3 came after us supposedly ""knew"" the owner by name, walked in, and was seated immediately. Fishy.
After confronting the hostess, she played dumb and said ""I don't know what you're talking about"" OK? Thanks?
A family of 16 (!!!) took a number and was seated immediately. 

Their dumplings probably are good, but it's sad that they don't value their customers enough to be honest with them. I don't mind waiting because I get it, it's a Saturday night, but don't lie.

Also, they automatically add 15% of your total to the bill, which I didn't know was even legal. 

All in all, the one star is for the integrity of this place...or the lack of. Won't be back.",0
"I went to Joe's because of the high rating. I ordered a variety of foods including their famous soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, a spicy fried shrimp dish (I don't remember the actual name on the menu), shrimp fried rice to name a few. I personally thought the flavors were bland. The fried shrimp and scallion pancakes were delish! My 11yr old liked the dumplings. I would go back for the pancakes and shrimp though.",0
"I'm probably spoiled by all the good eateries in LA, but Joe's Shanghai was pretty disappointing.  The hubs and I came for an early dinner but it was already busy.  We got seated with a family of eight strangers.  Kinda weird but this place is tiny.  So if you're not into dining with complete strangers, this might be an issue.  

Scallion pancakes were bomb.  I would get it again!  Got an order each of the pork and and crab XLB/soup dumplings.  The hubs thought the crab filling was a bit too fishy.  I though both dumplings were okay.  I felt like the meat wasn't fresh and the dumpling skin was too thick on top but too thin on the bottom.  This was an issue when we were picking them up to eat.  They line the bottom of the dumpling basket with napa cabbage but the dumplings kept sticking to it. What a waste of the delicious soup!  

Food was okay.  Staff was friendly and relatively attentive considering how busy it was.  Cheap prices!",0
"Ever since I saw the No Reservations episode in China where Bourdain eats the largest soup dumpling I've ever seen with a straw, I was immediately smitten and knew that I had to find a place in New York that resembled it. After sharing my love of all things dumpling-esque to some friends, they had turned me towards Joe's Shanghai. Joe's is a NY staple that has catered to numerous celebrity patrons and chefs. That alone is enough of a reason to give it a shot.

I was a bit disappointed when I found out that they don't serve those massive dumplings I had seen on TV, but was pleased to know that they serve some of the tastiest lil treats this side of Chinatown! We ordered the crab meat and pork meat dumplings to see which one was best. Where to begin... the first lil bite of these lil guys is fantastic! Allowing the piping hot soup to billow out of the fragile moist shell and onto your palate. It's foodgasmic! Perfect to have on a cold night in the city .. or after a night of heavy drinking. I preferred the pork ones over the crab meat, but they were both delicious. 

The only reason I am not giving Joe's a 4 or 5 rating is because their other dishes lacked a bit. The general tso's was dry and overcooked. The chunks of chicken that were served were a bit fatty and didn't make me want more. Although, the scallion pancakes were excellent!!!! O yea... definitely craving some of those right about now!",0
"The food is good here, but look at your bill carefully.  They put a tip on the tab before they even put the tax.

I think that's a really dirty trick, most people would miss it and end up tipping again.",0
Their soup dumpling is great. Food is great. But the guy taking our order stopped us from getting more saying we were ordering too much. It's not his call. That's just. Rude.,0
"Recently came here a few mins before it opened and seated ourselves. We ordered the pork and crab one and this time I preferred the pork. The crab had a very strong ""roe"" taste to it. The skin on the dumplings was super thick too. So disappointed, at least it was very cheap.",0
"Heard a lot of great things about this place and by the line that was at the door when we walked up it must be the best thing ever right? 

Eh... I was really expecting something so wonderfully delicious that I would be like a crack addict so addicted that I would just need more!  I think all the hype might have pushed my expectations above reality.  

Don't get me wrong it was good. Definately diffent than eating potstickers or shumai or hargow. Which I enjoyed the broth inside the dumplings.  But after that initial suprise from the first one you eat...you just don't get that from the 2nd or 3rd one.

Really crowded obviously a tourist attraction (myself included) but not a must have and a must go to every visit I make to NYC.

Oh and CASH only!",0
"I don't seem to get why this place is crazy popular. I came here to get some crab meat soup dumplings and they were not what I expected. The soup dumplings came out slightly warm. I was expecting something pipping hot and enjoyable, but it really wasn't. 
The restaurant could use a tune up especially the tea cups and plates. They are all scratched up. Don't expect to get your own table. Most likely you will be sharing a table with other customers.
There are much better options in Chinatown to go to.",0
"First the good part - the Dumplings are very good, no question. But, you will be better off just eating that. We ordered Lo mein chicken noodles and Salt and Pepper shrimp (shell-off). There was intense chlorine smell off the shrimps. There was barely any flour coating on the shrimp. At best, it was mediocre tasting. I could have had great salt and pepper shrimp at my local PF Changs which is far far better. Lo mein noodles didn't even have enough salt. My local Chinese restaurant makes it much better.

This place has become a tourist trap. Lines are long, it took us 20 minutes to get in. Service was fast, which is good. The nearby 456 restaurant has much better food and cleaner environment. 

Go for the dumplings, which are some of the best in Chinatown. Everything else, meh!!",0
First time at this new location. Food and service was good but we wished that they would tell us in advanced that there's a 15% service charge that's included in our bill. We didn't realize it until we got home and we gave tips on top of the total too. They should've had some kind of honor system.,0
"for all the rave reviews - i have to say this place isnt anything wildly mind blowing.

the soup dumplings are good - i prefer the crab + pork to the pork.

we also ordered the sesame chicken and vegitable lomein. lomein was no good. but the sesame chicken was VERY GOOD!

im only giving three stars, cause the sesame chicken albeit delicious was overpriced. and the rest of the meal was just OK. also service leaves something to be desired...",0
"Pretty mediocre food.  While I'm an ardent supporter of not-too-doughy xiao long bao, Joe's were flimsy out of the basket.  They tore much too quickly, spilling that ever-so-valuable soup out.  The one's that managed to stay together were a-ok, but nothing special.

Relatively expensive to boot.",0
"The infamous 'soup dumpling' was just ok - not great.  Not sure why everyone thinks this place is 'to-die-for'...  I'd rather stab in the arm than return to this joint and get 'plates, cups, utensils, etc' thrown at me by those disgruntled workers!  They rush everything, from the moment you sit your butt down to when you finish your first bite, then it's 'boom' - the check is on your table, while the servers gwak at you to ensure you pay and leave a tip for them.  

Seriously, there are better soup dumpling places..  when visiting Cali, go hit up Ding Tai Fung, so freaking good.  Much better services and larger variety of selections to choose from.",0
"overrated dumplings, overrated in general but Szechuan noodles are actually spicy and authentic so get that!",0
"Best soup dumplings in town!  Crab with pork steamed bun is the number 1 item on the menu, not just literally. They have an extensive menu with a whole lot of items that can be overwhelming. Just focus on the soup dumplings and the kungpao chicken and you're good!

The noodle dishes are greasy. There's usually a long wait. Also, you are more often that not, expected to share a round table with strangers - like in many Chinatown dimsum restaurants. It doesn't really matter once the soup dumplings arrive!",0
"Disappointed in the food. I ordered one of the specials, Szechuan fish and it was soggy and way over sauced. Big portion though. I was hoping for something more flavorful and savory, more authentic, and a smaller portion would have been fine.",0
"Place is not clean. hardly anyone speaks English. They have good steamed dumplings Shanghai style but the rest of the food is below average. Fish ordered came out with a sweet sauce that was not edible. Seafood is below average. Sauces are not very good, but have no taste. Only thing that was above average were the steamed dumplings, very hot, so take your time in eating. Not good decoration, and restrooms are unclean like the flatware.",0
